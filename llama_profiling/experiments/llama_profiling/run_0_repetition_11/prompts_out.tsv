1760568687	1760568689	Passage: Persian language -- Persian (/ˈpɜːrʒən, -ʃən/), also known by its endonym Farsi (فارسی fārsi (fɒːɾˈsiː) ( listen)), is one of the Western Iranian languages within the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family. It is primarily spoken in Iran, Afghanistan (officially known as Dari since 1958), and Tajikistan (officially known as Tajiki since the Soviet era), and some other regions which historically were Persianate societies and considered part of Greater Iran. It is written in the Persian alphabet, a modified variant of the Arabic script, which itself evolved from the Aramaic alphabet.  Question: do iran and afghanistan speak the same language  Explain your choice.	  Based on the given passage, it can be said that Iran and Afghanistan do not speak the same language. The passage mentions that Persian is spoken in Iran, Afghanistan (officially known as Dari since 1958), and Tajikistan (officially known as Tajiki since the Soviet era). This implies that while Iran and Afghanistan share some similarities in their languages, they are not the same language.  The passage also mentions that Persian is one of the Western Iranian languages within the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family, which further suggests that Iranian languages are distinct from other languages spoken in the region. Therefore, while Iran and Afghanistan share some linguistic similarities, they have distinct languages with their own unique features and characteristics.	172	
1760568689	1760568693	Passage: Good Samaritan law -- Good Samaritan laws offer legal protection to people who give reasonable assistance to those who are, or who they believe to be, injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. The protection is intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, for fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. An example of such a law in common-law areas of Canada: a good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing. Its purpose is to keep people from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in treatment. By contrast, a duty to rescue law requires people to offer assistance and holds those who fail to do so liable.  Question: do good samaritan laws protect those who help at an accident  Explain your choice.	  Yes, good Samaritan laws are intended to protect individuals who provide reasonable assistance to those who are injured, ill, or in peril, including at accidents. The laws aim to encourage bystanders to come to the aid of those in need without hesitation, knowing that they will not be held liable for any unintentional injury or wrongful death that may occur during the course of providing assistance.  In the context of accidents, good Samaritan laws can protect individuals who stop to provide aid, such as calling emergency services, administering first aid, or otherwise assisting the injured party. These laws recognize that accidents can be chaotic and unpredictable, and that bystanders may not have the training or expertise to provide perfect care. By offering legal protection, good Samaritan laws aim to encourage bystanders to take action and provide necessary assistance without fear of legal repercussions.  It is worth noting that the specifics of good Samaritan laws can vary depending on the jurisdiction, and some laws may have additional requirements or limitations. However, in general, good Samaritan laws are intended to provide a legal framework that encourages bystanders to act with compassion and provide necessary assistance in emergency situations.	268	
1760568693	1760568694	Passage: Windows Movie Maker -- Windows Movie Maker (formerly known as Windows Live Movie Maker in Windows 7) is a discontinued video editing software by Microsoft. It is a part of Windows Essentials software suite and offers the ability to create and edit videos as well as to publish them on OneDrive, Facebook, Vimeo, YouTube, and Flickr.  Question: is windows movie maker part of windows essentials  Explain your choice.	  Yes, that is correct. According to the passage, Windows Movie Maker is part of the Windows Essentials software suite.	27	
1760568694	1760568697	Passage: Powdered sugar -- Powdered sugar, also called confectioners' sugar, icing sugar, and icing cake, is a finely ground sugar produced by milling granulated sugar into a powdered state. It usually contains a small amount of anti-caking agent to prevent clumping and improve flow. Although most often produced in a factory, powdered sugar can also be made by processing ordinary granulated sugar in a coffee grinder, or by crushing it by hand in a mortar and pestle.  Question: is confectionary sugar the same as powdered sugar  Explain your choice.	  No, confectioner's sugar and powdered sugar are not the same. While they are often used interchangeably, they have slightly different meanings.  Confectioner's sugar refers specifically to a type of powdered sugar that is made by grinding granulated sugar into a fine powder using a confectioner's sugar grinder. This type of sugar is commonly used in baking and candy-making, as it is finer than regular powdered sugar and has a more uniform consistency.  Powdered sugar, on the other hand, is a more general term that can refer to any type of sugar that has been ground into a fine powder. This can include granulated sugar that has been ground in a coffee grinder or crushed in a mortar and pestle, as well as confectioner's sugar.  So while confectioner's sugar is a type of powdered sugar, not all powdered sugar is confectioner's sugar.	216	
1760568697	1760568705	Passage: The Elder Scrolls Online -- As with other games in The Elder Scrolls series, the game is set on the continent of Tamriel. The events of the game occur a millennium before those of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and around 800 years before The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. It has a broadly similar structure to Skyrim, with two separate conflicts progressing at the same time, one with the fate of the world in the balance, and one where the prize is supreme power on Tamriel. In The Elder Scrolls Online, the first struggle is against the Daedric Prince Molag Bal, who is attempting to meld the plane of Mundus with his realm of Coldharbour, and the second is to capture the vacant imperial throne, contested by three alliances of the mortal races. The player character has been sacrificed to Molag Bal, and Molag Bal has stolen their soul, the recovery of which is the primary game objective.  Question: is elder scrolls online the same as skyrim  Explain your choice.	  No, The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) is not the same as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. While both games are set in the continent of Tamriel and share some similarities in terms of gameplay and setting, they are distinct games with different stories, characters, and gameplay mechanics.  Here are some key differences between ESO and Skyrim:  1. Time period: Skyrim is set in the ninth century of the Tamrielic calendar, around 200 years after the events of Oblivion. ESO, on the other hand, is set a millennium before Skyrim, around 800 years before Morrowind and 400 years before Oblivion. 2. Setting: While both games are set in the fantasy world of Tamriel, ESO takes place in a more urban and political setting, with a focus on the conflict between different alliances of mortal races. Skyrim, on the other hand, takes place in a more rural and isolated setting, with a focus on the struggle against the dragon Alduin and the return of the Dragonborn. 3. Story: The story of ESO revolves around the player character's soul being stolen by Molag Bal, with the primary objective being to recover it. Skyrim, on the other hand, has a more open-ended story with multiple factions and questlines, allowing players to choose their own path and destiny. 4. Gameplay mechanics: ESO has a more action-oriented combat system, with a focus on melee combat and magic spells. Skyrim, on the other hand, has a more traditional RPG-style combat system, with a focus on character building and customization. 5. Multiplayer: ESO is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), which means that players can interact and collaborate with other players in real-time. Skyrim, on the other hand, is a single-player game with some cooperative gameplay features.  Overall, while both games share some similarities in terms of setting and gameplay mechanics, they are distinct games with different stories, characters, and gameplay mechanics.	479	
1760568705	1760568706	Passage: Epsom railway station -- Epsom railway station serves the town of Epsom in Surrey. It is located off Waterloo Road and is less than two minutes' walk from the High Street. It is not in the London Oyster card zone unlike Epsom Downs or Tattenham Corner stations. The station building was replaced in 2012/2013 with a new building with apartments above the station (see end of article).  Question: can you use oyster card at epsom station  Explain your choice.	  No, you cannot use an Oyster card at Epsom railway station. According to the passage, Epsom railway station is not located in the London Oyster card zone, which means that Oyster cards are not valid for travel to or from this station.	59	1.0
1760568706	1760568708	Passage: Da Vinci's Demons -- The series premiered in the United States on Starz on 12 April 2013, and its second season premiered on 22 March 2014. The series was renewed for a third season, which premiered on 24 October 2015. On 23 July 2015, Starz announced that the third season would be the show's last. However Goyer has left it open for a miniseries return.  Question: will there be a season 4 of da vinci's demons  Explain your choice.	  Based on the information provided in the passage, there will not be a season 4 of Da Vinci's Demons. According to the passage, the series premiered its third season on 24 October 2015, and on 23 July 2015, Starz announced that the third season would be the show's last. This means that there are no plans for a fourth season of the series.  However, the passage also notes that showrunner David S. Goyer has left the door open for a miniseries return, which could potentially lead to a revival of the show in the future. But as of now, there is no confirmation of a fourth season.	150	
1760568708	1760568713	Passage: Federal judiciary of the United States -- The federal courts are composed of three levels of courts. The Supreme Court of the United States is the court of last resort. It is generally an appellate court that operates under discretionary review, which means that the Court can choose which cases to hear, by granting writs of certiorari. There is therefore generally no basic right of appeal that extends automatically all the way to the Supreme Court. In a few situations (like lawsuits between state governments or some cases between the federal government and a state) it sits as a court of original jurisdiction.  Question: is the federal court the same as the supreme court  Explain your choice.	  No, the federal court is not the same as the Supreme Court of the United States.  The federal court refers to the entire system of federal courts in the United States, which includes multiple levels of courts with different jurisdictions and responsibilities. The Supreme Court of the United States is a part of the federal court system, but it is the highest court in the country and has the final say on matters of federal law and the Constitution.  The federal court system consists of three levels of courts:  1. District Courts: These are the trial courts of the federal system, with jurisdiction over cases involving federal laws, the Constitution, and treaties. There are 94 district courts in the United States, with at least one in each state. 2. Circuit Courts of Appeals: These courts hear appeals from the district courts and have jurisdiction over a specific geographic area, known as a circuit. There are 13 circuit courts of appeals in the United States. 3. Supreme Court of the United States: As mentioned in the passage, this is the court of last resort, with the final say on matters of federal law and the Constitution.  So, while the Supreme Court is a part of the federal court system, the federal court and the Supreme Court are not interchangeable terms. The federal court refers to the entire system of federal courts, while the Supreme Court is the highest court in the land and the final arbiter of legal matters involving the federal government and the Constitution.	316	
1760568713	1760568716	Passage: Bixby letter -- In the 1998 war film Saving Private Ryan, General George Marshall (played by Harve Presnell) reads the Bixby letter to his officers before giving the order to find and send home Private James Francis Ryan after Ryan's three brothers died in battle.  Question: did abraham lincoln write the letter in saving private ryan  Explain your choice.	  No, Abraham Lincoln did not write the letter in the movie Saving Private Ryan. The Bixby letter is a fictional letter created for the movie and is not based on any real letter written by Abraham Lincoln.  The Bixby letter is a heart-wrenching letter written by an unnamed mother to General George Marshall, in which she thanks him for the sacrifice of her son and asks that he spare the life of her remaining son, Private James Francis Ryan, who is also in the military. The letter is a pivotal moment in the movie, as it moves General Marshall to order a dangerous mission to find and bring Private Ryan home after he learns that all four of his brothers have been killed in action.  Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, was not involved in the creation or writing of the Bixby letter. He was assassinated in 1865, more than 30 years before the events of the movie take place.	208	
1760568716	1760568718	Passage: Batman & Robin (film) -- With the box office success of Batman Forever in June 1995, Warner Bros. immediately commissioned a sequel. They hired director Joel Schumacher and writer Akiva Goldsman to reprise their duties the following August, and decided it was best to fast track production for a June 1997 target release date, which is a break from the usual 3-year gap between films. Schumacher wanted to homage both the broad camp style of the 1960s television series and the work of Dick Sprang. The storyline of Batman & Robin was conceived by Schumacher and Goldsman during pre-production on A Time to Kill. Portions of Mr. Freeze's back-story were based on the Batman: The Animated Series episode ``Heart of Ice'', written by Paul Dini.  Question: is batman and robin a sequel to batman forever  Explain your choice.	  Yes, Batman & Robin is a sequel to Batman Forever. The passage states that Warner Bros. commissioned a sequel to Batman Forever immediately after its box office success in June 1995, and that the film was fast-tracked for a June 1997 release date. This suggests that Batman & Robin is a direct follow-up to the previous film, rather than a standalone movie. Additionally, the passage mentions that the storyline was conceived by Schumacher and Goldsman during pre-production on A Time to Kill, which suggests that they were building on the events and characters established in Batman Forever.	143	
1760568718	1760568722	Passage: Badger -- Badgers are short-legged omnivores in the family Mustelidae, which also includes the otters, polecats, weasels, and wolverines. They belong to the caniform suborder of carnivoran mammals. The 11 species of badgers are grouped in three subfamilies: Melinae (Eurasian badgers), Mellivorinae (the honey badger or ratel), and Taxideinae (the American badger). The Asiatic stink badgers of the genus Mydaus were formerly included within Melinae (and thus Mustelidae), but recent genetic evidence indicates these are actually members of the skunk family, placing them in the taxonomic family Mephitidae.  Question: is a wolverine the same as a badger  Explain your choice.	  No, a wolverine is not the same as a badger. Although both badgers and wolverines are carnivorans (members of the mammalian order Carnivora), they belong to different families and have distinct physical and behavioral characteristics.  Badgers are members of the family Mustelidae, which includes other omnivorous mammals such as otters, polecats, and weasels. There are 11 species of badgers, which are grouped into three subfamilies: Melinae (Eurasian badgers), Mellivorinae (the honey badger or ratel), and Taxideinae (the American badger).  Wolverines, on the other hand, are members of the family Mustelidae, but they belong to a different genus (Gulo gulo) than badgers. Wolverines are larger than badgers and have distinctive physical features, such as their long, broad snout, short legs, and thick, shaggy fur. They are also solitary animals and have a different behavioral profile than badgers.  So, while both badgers and wolverines are carnivorans, they are different species and are not the same.	264	
1760568722	1760568724	Passage: Green Lantern (film) -- Green Lantern was released on June 17, 2011, and received generally negative reviews; most criticized the film for its screenplay, inconsistent tone, choice and portrayal of villains, and its use of CGI, while some praised Reynolds' performance. Reynolds would later voice his dissatisfaction with the film. The film underperformed at the box office, grossing $219 million against a production budget of $200 million. Due to the film's negative reception and disappointing box office performance, Warner Bros. canceled any plans for a sequel, instead opting to reboot the character in the DC Extended Universe line with the film Green Lantern Corps, set for release in 2020.  Question: will there be a green lantern 2 movie  Explain your choice.	  Based on the passage, it appears that there will not be a Green Lantern 2 movie. The film received negative reviews and underperformed at the box office, leading Warner Bros. to cancel any plans for a sequel and instead reboot the character in the DC Extended Universe line with the film Green Lantern Corps, set for release in 2020. This suggests that the studio has decided to start over with a new interpretation of the character rather than continuing the story of the original film.	108	1.0
1760568724	1760568726	Passage: United States and the International Criminal Court -- The United States should have the chance to observe and assess the functioning of the court, over time, before choosing to become subject to its jurisdiction. Given these concerns, I will not, and do not recommend that my successor, submit the treaty to the Senate for advice and consent until our fundamental concerns are satisfied.  Question: does the icc has jurisdiction in the united states  Explain your choice.	"  Based on the passage, the United States does not have jurisdiction over the International Criminal Court (ICC). The passage states that the United States ""should have the chance to observe and assess the functioning of the court, over time, before choosing to become subject to its jurisdiction."" This implies that the United States is not currently subject to the jurisdiction of the ICC and is instead reserving the right to observe and assess the court's functioning before deciding whether to join. Therefore, the answer is no, the ICC does not have jurisdiction in the United States."	123	
1760568726	1760568728	Passage: Calcium carbide -- Calcium carbide is a chemical compound with the chemical formula of CaC. Its main use industrially is in the production of acetylene and calcium cyanamide.  Question: calcium carbide cac2 is the raw material for the production of acetylene  Explain your choice.	  My choice is option (A): Calcium carbide (CaC2) is the raw material for the production of acetylene.  The passage states that calcium carbide is industrially used in the production of acetylene and calcium cyanamide. Acetylene is a chemical compound with the formula C2H2, which is produced through the reaction of calcium carbide (CaC2) with water (H2O):  CaC2 + H2O → C2H2 + Ca(OH)2  Therefore, calcium carbide is the raw material for the production of acetylene.	144	
1760568728	1760568729	Passage: Now You See Me (film series) -- Now You See Me is a series of heist thriller film written by Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin, and Edward Ricourt. They focus on the actions of a team of illusionists named ``The Four Horsemen'' who pull off near impossible heists. The series features an ensemble cast including Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Michael Caine, Lizzy Caplan, and Morgan Freeman. The first film was released in 2013, while the second was released in 2016, and a third film is currently in development and set to be released in 2019. The series has received mixed reviews from critics and audiences and grossed nearly $700 million worldwide.  Question: is there a now you see me 3 coming out  Explain your choice.	"  Yes, a third installment of the ""Now You See Me"" film series is currently in development and set to be released in 2019. According to the passage, a third film is mentioned as being ""currently in development"" and slated for a 2019 release. This implies that a third movie is indeed happening and will be released in the near future."	82	
1760568729	1760568731	Passage: Penalty shoot-out (association football) -- A shoot-out is usually considered for statistical purposes to be separate from the match which preceded it. In the case of a two-legged fixture, the two matches are still considered either as two draws or as one win and one loss; in the case of a single match, it is still considered as a draw. This contrasts with a fixture won in extra time, where the score at the end of normal time is superseded. Converted shoot-out penalties are not considered as goals scored by a player for the purposes of their individual records, or for ``golden boot'' competitions.  Question: does a penalty shoot out goal count towards the golden boot  Explain your choice.	  No, a penalty shootout goal does not count towards the golden boot award. According to the passage, converted shootout penalties are not considered as goals scored by a player for the purposes of their individual records or for golden boot competitions. This means that any goals scored in a penalty shootout are not included in the total goals scored by a player for the purpose of the golden boot award.	83	
1760568731	1760568734	Passage: Cutthroat Kitchen -- Cutthroat Kitchen is a cooking show hosted by Alton Brown that aired on the Food Network from August 11, 2013 to July 19, 2017. It features four chefs competing in a three-round elimination cooking competition. The contestants face auctions in which they can purchase opportunities to sabotage one another. Each chef is given $25,000 at the start of the show; the person left standing keeps whatever money they have not spent in the auctions. The show ended on its fifteenth season in July 2017. The series shares some basic elements with other four-chef, three-round elimination-style competitions on Food Network including Chopped and Guy's Grocery Games. Numerous Cutthroat Kitchen contestants have competed on these shows.  Question: will there be a new season of cutthroat kitchen  Explain your choice.	  Unfortunately, there will not be a new season of Cutthroat Kitchen. The show ended its run on the Food Network in July 2017 after a 15-season run. While there have been no official announcements from the network or the show's host, Alton Brown, it appears that Cutthroat Kitchen has been cancelled.  The show's popularity and critical acclaim during its run suggest that it was well-liked by audiences and critics alike. However, the Food Network has a history of canceling popular shows after a few seasons, and it appears that Cutthroat Kitchen did not meet their current programming needs.  That being said, there is always a possibility of a revival or spin-off of the show in the future. Fans of Cutthroat Kitchen can keep an eye out for any updates or announcements from the Food Network or Alton Brown regarding a potential new season or spin-off.	216	
1760568734	1760568735	Passage: Jack Sikma -- In 2006, Sikma was voted as one of the 100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament, a group of former players and coaches in honor of the 100 anniversary of the IHSA boys basketball tournament. On June 27, 2017, Sikma was inducted into the Small College Basketball Hall of Fame as part of their second class . Inducted alongside Sikma were Zelmo Beaty, Walt Frazier, Bob Love, Elmore Smith, Jim Spivey, Rico Swanson, George Tinsley, and Al Tucker.  Question: is jack sikma in the hall of fame  Explain your choice.	  Yes, Jack Sikma is in the hall of fame. According to the passage, he was inducted into the Small College Basketball Hall of Fame on June 27, 2017.	44	
1760568735	1760568740	Passage: Half-elven -- In J.R.R. Tolkien's fictional universe of Middle-earth, the Half-elven (Sindarin singular Peredhel, plural Peredhil, Quenya singular Perelda) are the children of the union of Elves and Men. Of these, the most significant were the products of couplings between the Eldar (the Elves who followed the Call to Valinor) and the Edain (the Men of the Three Houses of early Men who allied themselves with the Eldar in their war against Morgoth).  Question: can elves and humans mate lord of the rings  Explain your choice.	"  Yes, in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, Elves and Men can mate and produce offspring, known as the Half-elven or Peredhil. This is evident from the passage provided, which states that the Half-elven are the children of the union of Elves and Men. Specifically, the most significant Half-elven were the products of couplings between the Eldar (the Elves who followed the Call to Valinor) and the Edain (the Men of the Three Houses of early Men who allied themselves with the Eldar in their war against Morgoth).  Tolkien's world of Middle-earth is rich in lore and history, and the concept of interbreeding between Elves and Men is an important aspect of this lore. The union of Elves and Men is depicted as a powerful and transformative act, capable of producing beings with unique abilities and strengths. For example, the Half-elven are said to possess the beauty and grace of the Elves, combined with the courage and resilience of Men.  It is worth noting that the Half-elven are not the only race that results from the interbreeding of Elves and Men. In Tolkien's world, there are also the ""Mixed Folk,"" who are the offspring of Elves and Men who are not directly descended from the Eldar or Edain. However, the Half-elven are the most significant and well-known of these hybrid races, and are often seen as the pinnacle of Elf-human unity."	353	
1760568740	1760568745	Passage: The Boy in the Plastic Bubble -- The Boy in the Plastic Bubble is a 1976 American made-for-television drama film inspired by the lives of David Vetter and Ted DeVita, who lacked effective immune systems. It stars John Travolta, Glynnis O'Connor, Diana Hyland, Robert Reed, Ralph Bellamy & P.J. Soles. It was written by Douglas Day Stewart, executive produced by Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg (who, at the time, produced Starsky and Hutch and Charlie's Angels), and directed by Randal Kleiser, who would work with Travolta again in Grease shortly after. The original music score was composed by Mark Snow. The theme song ``What Would They Say'' was written and sung by Paul Williams. William Howard Taft High School in Woodland Hills was used for filming.  Question: the boy in the plastic bubble based on true story  Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the movie ""The Boy in the Plastic Bubble"" is based on a true story. The film is inspired by the lives of two boys, David Vetter and Ted DeVita, who were born without an effective immune system and had to live in plastic bubbles to protect them from infections.  David Vetter, also known as ""The Boy in the Bubble,"" was born in 1971 with a rare genetic disorder called severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). As a result, he was unable to fight off infections and was confined to a plastic bubble for most of his life. Despite his isolation, Vetter became a symbol of hope and inspiration for many people, and his story was widely covered in the media.  Ted DeVita, on the other hand, was born with a different immune disorder and also had to live in a plastic bubble for protection. His story was also widely reported, and it inspired the creation of the movie ""The Boy in the Plastic Bubble.""  The film was written by Douglas Day Stewart, executive produced by Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg, and directed by Randal Kleiser. It stars John Travolta as a doctor who becomes involved in the lives of the two boys and their families. The movie was released in 1976 and was a critical and commercial success, and it remains a popular and inspiring true story to this day."	315	
1760568745	1760568748	Passage: A priori and a posteriori -- These terms are used with respect to reasoning (epistemology) to distinguish ``necessary conclusions from first premises'' (i.e., what must come before sense observation) from ``conclusions based on sense observation'' (which must follow it). Thus, the two kinds of knowledge, justification, or argument, may be glossed:  Question: science begins with the premise that knowledge should first be acquired through observation  Explain your choice.	"  My choice for the answer to the question ""Science begins with the premise that knowledge should first be acquired through observation"" is:  A posteriori  The term ""a posteriori"" refers to knowledge or conclusions that are based on sense observation or experience. In the context of science, this means that scientific knowledge begins with observations and data collected through sensory experiences, rather than with prior assumptions or beliefs.  The passage highlights the distinction between ""a priori"" and ""a posteriori"" knowledge, with ""a priori"" referring to necessary conclusions that can be derived from first premises, and ""a posteriori"" referring to conclusions based on sense observation. By placing the emphasis on observation, the passage suggests that science begins with a focus on empirical data and evidence, rather than with prior assumptions or beliefs.  Therefore, the answer ""A posteriori"" best completes the statement ""Science begins with the premise that knowledge should first be acquired through observation."""	208	
1760568748	1760568749	Passage: Tim Brown (American football) -- Timothy Donell Brown (born July 22, 1966) is a former American football wide receiver who played professionally in the National Football League (NFL).

1760568749	1760568752	Passage: Drinking in public -- Drinking in public in Denmark is legal in general. The law forbids ``disturbing of the public law and order''. Thus general consumption is accepted. Several cafes have outdoor serving in the same zones.  Question: can you drink alcohol in public in denmark  Explain your choice.	"  Yes, in Denmark, it is generally legal to drink alcohol in public. The law does not prohibit drinking in public, but rather forbids disturbing the public peace and order. As long as an individual is not causing any disturbance or disrupting the peace, they are allowed to consume alcohol in a public place.  This is evident from the passage, which states that ""Drinking in public in Denmark is legal in general."" The law only prohibits disturbing the public peace and order, which means that as long as an individual is not causing any disturbance, they are free to consume alcohol in a public place.  Furthermore, the passage mentions that several cafes have outdoor serving in the same zones, which suggests that drinking alcohol in public is not only legal but also common and accepted in Denmark.  Therefore, based on the information provided in the passage, it can be concluded that it is legal to drink alcohol in public in Denmark."	208	
1760568752	1760568753	Passage: Jersey pound -- Both Jersey and Bank of England notes are legal tender in Jersey and circulate together, alongside the Guernsey pound and Scottish banknotes. The Jersey notes are not legal tender in the United Kingdom but are legal currency, so creditors and traders may accept them if they so choose.  Question: is jersey currency legal tender in the uk  Explain your choice.	  No, Jersey currency is not legal tender in the UK. According to the passage, Jersey pound notes are not legal tender in the United Kingdom. Legal tender refers to the currency that a court may force a creditor to accept as payment for a debt, and the Jersey pound is not recognized as legal tender in the UK. Therefore, creditors and traders in the UK are not required to accept Jersey pound notes as payment, and they may choose to accept them only if they so desire.	106

According to the passage, the Bucks won one league title in 1971. Therefore, the answer is yes.	47	
1760568754	1760568757	Passage: List of FIFA World Cup penalty shoot-outs -- This is a list of all penalty shoot-outs that have occurred in the Finals tournament of the FIFA World Cup. Penalty shoot-outs were introduced as tie-breakers in the 1978 World Cup but did not occur before 1982. The first time a World Cup title was won by penalty shoot-out was in 1994. The only other time was in 2006. By the end of the 2018 edition, 30 shoot-outs have taken place in the World Cup. Of these, only two reached the sudden death stage after still being tied at the end of ``best of five kicks''.  Question: does the world cup final go to penalties  Explain your choice.	  Yes, the FIFA World Cup Final can go to penalty shootouts if the match is tied after the regular 90 minutes of play and any additional extra time. This is according to the FIFA World Cup tie-breaking procedure, which states that if the score is still tied after the end of the second period of extra time, the match will be decided by penalty shootouts.  This is evident from the passage provided, which states that penalty shootouts were introduced as tie-breakers in the 1978 World Cup and have been used in every World Cup tournament since then, including the most recent edition in 2018. The passage also notes that the only two times a World Cup title was won by penalty shootout were in 1994 and 2006, further reinforcing the idea that the World Cup Final can go to penalty shootouts if necessary.	187	
1760568757	1760568760	Passage: Kingdom (manga) -- Kingdom (キングダム, Kingudamu) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yasuhisa Hara (原泰久, Hara Yasuhisa). The manga provides a fictionalized account of the Warring States period primarily through the experiences of the war orphan Xin and his comrades as he fights to become the greatest general under the heavens, and in doing so, unifying China for the first time in history. The series was adapted into a thirty-eight episode anime series by studio Pierrot that aired from June 4, 2012 to February 25, 2013. A second season was announced and aired from June 8, 2013 to March 1, 2014. An English language release of the anime was licensed by Funimation.  Question: is kingdom manga based on a true story  Explain your choice.	  No, Kingdom manga is not based on a true story. The series is a work of fiction that provides a fictionalized account of the Warring States period in China. While the manga may draw inspiration from historical events and figures, it is not meant to be a historically accurate depiction of the period.  The manga's author, Yasuhisa Hara, has stated that he took creative liberties with the historical events and characters to create an exciting and engaging story. Therefore, the events and characters in the manga are not meant to be taken as factual, but rather as a fictional interpretation of the Warring States period.  Therefore, based on the information provided in the passage, it can be concluded that Kingdom manga is not based on a true story.	170	
1760568760	1760568761	Passage: European Economic Area -- As of 2014 the contracting parties to the EEA are 3 of the 4 EFTA member states and 27 of the 28 EU member states. The 28th and newest EU member, Croatia, finished negotiating their accession to the EEA in November 2013, and since 12 April 2014 is provisionally applying the agreement pending its ratification by all EEA member states.  Question: is croatia part of the european economic area  Explain your choice.	  Yes, Croatia is part of the European Economic Area (EEA) as of 2014. According to the given passage, Croatia finished negotiating their accession to the EEA in November 2013 and has been provisionally applying the agreement since 12 April 2014, pending its ratification by all EEA member states. This means that Croatia has officially joined the EEA and is a contracting party to the agreement as of the given year.	110	
1760568761	1760568765	Passage: Posthumous marriage -- Posthumous marriage (or necrogamy) is a marriage in which one of the participating members is deceased. It is legal in France and similar forms are practiced in Sudan and China. Since World War I, France has had hundreds of requests each year, of which many have been accepted.  Question: can u marry a dead person in france  Explain your choice.	  Yes, in France, it is possible to marry a dead person through a legal process known as posthumous marriage or necrogamy. While it may seem unusual or even unsettling to some, posthumous marriage is a recognized legal practice in France and has been since the 1970s.  According to French law, a person can marry a deceased person if they have been legally married before their death and their spouse has not remarried. The process involves obtaining a death certificate and a declaration from the deceased person's spouse stating that they are not in a new relationship.  While it is important to note that posthumous marriage is not recognized in all countries, it is legal in France and Sudan, and similar practices exist in China. However, it is essential to consult with local authorities and legal experts to understand the specific laws and regulations surrounding posthumous marriage in each country.  It is worth mentioning that posthumous marriage is not a common practice and is primarily sought after by individuals who have lost a loved one and wish to legally recognize their relationship. Additionally, the process can be emotionally challenging and may require significant documentation and proof of the deceased person's identity and marriage history.	265	
1760568765	1760568769	Passage: Saline (medicine) -- Saline, also known as saline solution, is a mixture of sodium chloride in water and has a number of uses in medicine. Applied to the affected area it is used to clean wounds, help remove contact lenses, and help with dry eyes. By injection into a vein it is used to treat dehydration such as from gastroenteritis and diabetic ketoacidosis. It is also used to dilute other medications to be given by injection.  Question: is saline and sodium chloride the same thing  Explain your choice.	  No, saline and sodium chloride are not the same thing, although they are related.  Saline refers to a mixture of sodium chloride (NaCl) in water, which is commonly used in medicine for various purposes. Sodium chloride, on the other hand, is a specific chemical compound composed of sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl).  So, while saline solution contains sodium chloride, the two terms are not interchangeable. Saline is the broader term that refers to the solution itself, while sodium chloride is a specific component of that solution.  In the passage, saline is used to clean wounds, remove contact lenses, and treat dehydration, among other things. Sodium chloride is one of the main components of saline solution, but it is not the only one. Other ingredients may include distilled water, preservatives, and other chemicals that help maintain the solution's stability and effectiveness.	222	
1760568769	1760568772	Passage: Bubonic plague -- Several classes of antibiotics are effective in treating bubonic plague. These include aminoglycosides such as streptomycin and gentamicin, tetracyclines (especially doxycycline), and the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. Mortality associated with treated cases of bubonic plague is about 1--15%, compared to a mortality of 40--60% in untreated cases.  Question: is there a treatment for the bubonic plague  Explain your choice.	  Yes, there is a treatment for the bubonic plague. According to the passage, several classes of antibiotics are effective in treating bubonic plague, including aminoglycosides such as streptomycin and gentamicin, tetracyclines (especially doxycycline), and the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. These antibiotics can significantly reduce the mortality associated with bubonic plague, with a mortality rate of about 1--15% for treated cases compared to a much higher mortality rate of 40--60% in untreated cases. This suggests that early treatment with effective antibiotics is crucial in preventing the progression of the disease and improving patient outcomes.	176	
1760568772	1760568774	Passage: Joyce Summers -- The premise of the series is that Buffy is the latest Slayer, a young woman endowed by mystical forces with superhuman powers to fight and defeat vampires, demons, and other evil forces in the fictional town of Sunnydale. Like every Slayer before her, she was chosen and informed of her destiny when she was 15 years old. Her mother is unaware of her daughter's powers and responsibilities until Buffy is forced to tell her at the end of the second season of the television series. Although Joyce is shocked at this revelation, she recovers quickly and remains a source of stability for Buffy and Buffy's small circle of friends who assist her, dubbed the Scooby Gang. Eventually Joyce is able to take Buffy's dangerous demon-fighting in stride and even become proud and respectful of her daughter's abilities. Her natural death from an illness in the fifth season forces Buffy to face becoming an adult.  Question: does buffy's mom know she's a slayer  Explain your choice.	"  According to the passage, Buffy's mother, Joyce, does not know that Buffy is the Slayer until the end of the second season of the television series. The passage states, ""Although Joyce is shocked at this revelation, she recovers quickly and remains a source of stability for Buffy and Buffy's small circle of friends who assist her, dubbed the Scooby Gang. Eventually Joyce is able to take Buffy's dangerous demon-fighting in stride and even become proud and respectful of her daughter's abilities."" This suggests that Joyce was not aware of Buffy's true identity as the Slayer until she was told by Buffy at the end of the second season."	160	
1760568774	1760568776	Passage: Leaning Tower of Pisa -- The tower's tilt began during construction in the 12th century, caused by an inadequate foundation on ground too soft on one side to properly support the structure's weight. The tilt increased in the decades before the structure was completed in the 14th century. It gradually increased until the structure was stabilized (and the tilt partially corrected) by efforts in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.  Question: was the leaning tower of pisa built leaning  Explain your choice.	  Yes, the Leaning Tower of Pisa was built leaning. According to the passage, the tower's tilt began during construction in the 12th century, caused by an inadequate foundation on ground too soft on one side to properly support the structure's weight. This means that the tower was not built level or straight, but rather tilted from the start. The passage also states that the tilt increased over time, indicating that the tower was built with a preexisting lean. Therefore, the answer is yes, the Leaning Tower of Pisa was built leaning.	129	
1760568776	1760568779	Passage: Fool's Gold (2008 film) -- Fool's Gold is a 2008 American adventure-romance film from Warner Bros. Pictures about a recently divorced couple who rekindle their romantic life while searching for a lost treasure. The film was directed by Andy Tennant and reunites the How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days stars Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson.  Question: is the movie fool's gold a true story  Explain your choice.	"  No, ""Fool's Gold"" is not a true story. It is a work of fiction, a romantic adventure film that was created for entertainment purposes. The movie's plot, characters, and events are not based on real-life events or people.  While the film's premise of a recently divorced couple searching for a lost treasure may be inspired by real-life stories of treasure hunters and adventurers, the movie's storyline is entirely fictional. The characters, their relationships, and the adventure they embark on are all created for the purpose of entertainment and are not based on any actual events or people.  Therefore, ""Fool's Gold"" is not a true story, but rather a work of fiction designed to entertain and captivate audiences."	175	
1760568779	1760568780	Passage: Super Bowl curse -- The home field curse affects the host team of the Super Bowl. So far no team has yet managed to reach the Super Bowl in their home stadium. Four teams with Super Bowls in their home venue have qualified for the divisional playoffs: the 1994 Miami Dolphins, the 1998 Miami Dolphins, the 2016 Houston Texans, and the 2017 Minnesota Vikings, the Vikings being the first to qualify for their conference's title game. From 1966--2011 (excluding the six Super Bowl games held in a stadium without a professional team), the Super Bowl host team has had 11 winning seasons, four split seasons, and 25 losing seasons. Mathematically, the probability of that many losing seasons or more occurring by chance (assuming a 50 percent chance of having a losing season (disregarding .500 seasons)) is 7.69 percent. It should be noted, however, that the Super Bowl host stadium is selected several years before the game is played, without regard to the teams that qualify.  Question: has any nfl team played the superbowl at home  Explain your choice.	  Yes, according to the passage, the 1994 Miami Dolphins, 1998 Miami Dolphins, 2016 Houston Texans, and 2017 Minnesota Vikings have all played in the Super Bowl in their home stadium. Therefore, the answer to the question is yes, at least one NFL team has played the Super Bowl at home.	84	
1760568780	1760568782	Passage: State constitution (Australia) -- In Australia, each state has its own constitution. Each state constitution preceded the Constitution of Australia as constitutions of the then separate British colonies, but all the states ceded powers to the Parliament of Australia as part of federation in 1901.  Question: does each australian state have its own constitution  Explain your choice.	  Yes, that is correct. Each Australian state has its own constitution. According to the passage, the state constitutions preceded the Constitution of Australia as constitutions of the then separate British colonies. This means that each state had its own constitution before the Federation of Australia in 1901. Although the states ceded powers to the Parliament of Australia as part of federation, they retained their own constitutions. Therefore, each Australian state has its own constitution.	97	
1760568782	1760568786	Passage: Bundle branch block -- A bundle branch block can be diagnosed when the duration of the QRS complex on the ECG exceeds 120 ms. A right bundle branch block typically causes prolongation of the last part of the QRS complex, and may shift the heart's electrical axis slightly to the right. The ECG will show a terminal R wave in lead V1 and a slurred S wave in lead I. Left bundle branch block widens the entire QRS, and in most cases shifts the heart's electrical axis to the left. The ECG will show a QS or rS complex in lead V1 and a monophasic R wave in lead I. Another normal finding with bundle branch block is appropriate T wave discordance. In other words, the T wave will be deflected opposite the terminal deflection of the QRS complex. Bundle branch block, especially left bundle branch block, can lead to cardiac dyssynchrony. The simultaneous occurrence of left and right bundle branch block leads to total AV block.  Question: can you have a right and left bundle branch block  Explain your choice.	"  Yes, it is possible to have both right and left bundle branch block. This is known as a ""mixed"" bundle branch block.  In a right bundle branch block, the prolongation of the QRS complex is typically seen in the right precordial leads (leads I, V5, V6), while in a left bundle branch block, the widening of the QRS complex is seen in the left precordial leads (leads I, V4, V5). However, in a mixed bundle branch block, both right and left bundle branch blocks are present, resulting in a widened QRS complex in both the right and left precordial leads.  The ECG findings in a mixed bundle branch block are similar to those of a right or left bundle branch block, with a prolonged QRS complex, slurred S wave, and appropriate T wave discordance. However, the ECG may also show a combination of right and left bundle branch block patterns, depending on the extent and location of the block.  It is important to note that a mixed bundle branch block is a relatively rare condition, and is often seen in conjunction with other cardiac conditions, such as coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy."	265	
1760568786	1760568789	Passage: Check (chess) -- In informal games, it is customary to announce ``check'' when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check. In formal competitions, however, check is rarely announced.  Question: do you always have to say check in chess  Explain your choice.	"  No, you don't always have to say ""check"" in chess. In informal games, it is customary to announce ""check"" when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check, but in formal competitions, it is not necessary to do so.  In formal chess competitions, players are expected to be aware of the rules and to know when their opponent's king is in check. Announcing ""check"" is not a requirement, as the focus is on the strategic aspects of the game rather than the formalities.  In fact, many professional chess players do not announce ""check"" during games, as they are too focused on making the best moves to worry about verbalizing every move. Instead, they rely on their opponents to be aware of the position of their king and to take appropriate action to avoid being checkmated.  That being said, announcing ""check"" can be helpful in informal games, as it allows the other player to be aware of the situation and to take appropriate action. However, in formal competitions, it is generally not necessary to make an announcement."	244	
1760568789	1760568795	Passage: Australian Cattle Dog -- The Texas Heeler is a cross between the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Shepherd that was first registered with the Animal Research Foundation (ARF) in 1970. The ARF has registered Australian Cattle Dogs without papers as ``Australian Cattledog Queensland Heelers'' since 1965 and was the first organisation to recognise the Australian Shepherd. Although originally bred for its ability to work cattle, the Texas Heeler is increasingly used as a pet and a companion in dog sports. As with most cross breeds, the Texas Heeler's size and appearance is a variable combination of the parent breeds.  Question: is an australian shepherd the same as an australian cattle dog  Explain your choice.	  No, an Australian Shepherd is not the same as an Australian Cattle Dog. While both breeds are originally from Australia and share some similarities, they are distinct breeds with different histories, purposes, and characteristics.  An Australian Shepherd is a breed that was developed in the 19th century in Australia for herding sheep and other livestock. It is also known as the Australian Shepherding Dog or the Aussie. The breed was recognized by the Australian National Kennel Club in 1936 and has since become popular as a working dog and family pet.  On the other hand, an Australian Cattle Dog is a breed that was developed in the mid-19th century in Australia for herding cattle. It is also known as the Blue Heeler or the Queensland Heeler. The breed was developed by crossing the Australian Kelpie with other working dog breeds, such as the Dingo and the Bull Terrier. The Australian Cattle Dog is known for its intelligence, energy, and herding ability, and is still widely used for its original purpose in Australia and other countries.  While both breeds are similar in size and build, with a medium-sized body and short, smooth coat, they have distinct differences in their temperaments and grooming needs. Australian Shepherds are generally more energetic and intelligent than Australian Cattle Dogs, and they require more exercise and mental stimulation. Australian Cattle Dogs, on the other hand, are more independent and less trainable than Australian Shepherds, and they require less grooming.  In summary, while both breeds are Australian in origin and share some similarities, they are distinct breeds with different histories, purposes, and characteristics.	374	
1760568795	1760568799	Passage: Tomato purée -- Tomato purée is a thick liquid made by cooking and straining tomatoes. The difference between tomato paste, tomato purée, and tomato sauce is consistency; tomato puree has a thicker consistency and a deeper flavour than sauce.  Question: is tomato puree and tomato sauce the same thing  Explain your choice.	  No, tomato puree and tomato sauce are not the same thing. While both are made from tomatoes, the main difference between them lies in their consistency and flavor.  Tomato puree is a thick liquid made by cooking and straining tomatoes. It has a thicker consistency than tomato sauce and a deeper, more intense flavor. Tomato puree is often used as a base for soups, sauces, and stews, where it can add depth and richness to the dish.  Tomato sauce, on the other hand, is a thinner liquid made by cooking tomatoes with herbs, spices, and sometimes acidic ingredients like vinegar or citric acid. It has a lighter consistency than tomato puree and a milder flavor. Tomato sauce is often used as a base for pasta sauces, pizza sauces, and other dishes where a lighter, more straightforward tomato flavor is desired.  So while both tomato puree and tomato sauce are made from tomatoes, they have different consistencies and flavors, making them suitable for different uses in the kitchen.	257	
1760568799	1760568801	Passage: The Blues Brothers -- The Blues Brothers are an American blues and soul revivalist band which was founded in 1978 by comedy actors Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi as part of a musical sketch on Saturday Night Live. Belushi and Aykroyd fronted the band, respectively in character as lead vocalist ``Joliet'' Jake Blues and harmonica player/vocalist Elwood Blues. The band was composed of well-known and respected musicians, and debuted as the musical guest on the April 22, 1978, episode of Saturday Night Live, opening the show performing ``Hey Bartender'', and later ``Soul Man''.  Question: is the blues brothers based on a true story  Explain your choice.	"  No, the Blues Brothers are not based on a true story. They are a fictional band created by Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi as part of a musical sketch on Saturday Night Live (SNL) in 1978. While the characters of Joliet Jake and Elwood Blues are based on real blues musicians, such as Jake and Elwood Blues of the blues band ""Howlin' Wolf,"" the band itself is a fictional creation."	104	
1760568801	1760568804	Passage: Newcastle upon Tyne -- Newcastle upon Tyne (locally /njuːˈkæsəl/ ( listen)), commonly known as Newcastle, is a city in Tyne and Wear, North East England, 103 miles (166 km) south of Edinburgh and 277 miles (446 km) north of London on the northern bank of the River Tyne, 8.5 mi (13.7 km) from the North Sea. Newcastle is the most populous city in the North East, and forms the core of the Tyneside conurbation, the eighth most populous urban area in the United Kingdom. Newcastle is a member of the English Core Cities Group and is a member of the Eurocities network of European cities.  Question: is newcastle upon tyne the same as newcastle  Explain your choice.	"  Yes, ""Newcastle upon Tyne"" and ""Newcastle"" are the same place. The full name ""Newcastle upon Tyne"" is the official name of the city, while ""Newcastle"" is a common abbreviation or shortened form of the name. Both names refer to the same location.  The use of ""Newcastle upon Tyne"" emphasizes the city's location on the River Tyne, which is a distinct geographical feature of the area. However, for most people, including locals and visitors, ""Newcastle"" is the preferred name, as it is easier to pronounce and use in everyday conversation.  In summary, while the full name ""Newcastle upon Tyne"" is technically correct, the common usage of ""Newcastle"" is acceptable and widely used, as it is a more convenient and familiar name for the city."	182	
1760568804	1760568805	Passage: Post Office Ltd -- The Post Office provides information on services and accepts postal items and payment on behalf of the two collection and delivery divisions of Royal Mail Group, Royal Mail and Parcelforce. These include a variety of ordinary and guaranteed services both for delivery within the United Kingdom and to international destinations. Postage stamps (including commemorative stamps and other philatelic items) are sold, while applications for redirection of mail are accepted on behalf of Royal Mail.  Question: is post office and royal mail the same  Explain your choice.	  No, Post Office and Royal Mail are not the same.  According to the passage, Post Office Ltd provides information on services and accepts postal items and payments on behalf of Royal Mail Group, which includes Royal Mail and Parcelforce. This suggests that Post Office Ltd is a separate entity from Royal Mail, which is one of the two collection and delivery divisions of Royal Mail Group.  Therefore, Post Office Ltd and Royal Mail are not the same, but rather two distinct entities that are related through their association with Royal Mail Group.	112	
1760568805	1760568807	Passage: Unsuccessful nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States -- Justices are nominated by the president and then confirmed by the U.S. Senate. A nomination to the Court is considered to be official when the Senate receives a signed nomination letter from the president naming the nominee, which is then entered in the Senate's record. There have been 37 unsuccessful nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States. Of these, 11 nominees were rejected in Senate roll-call votes, 11 were withdrawn by the president, and 15 lapsed at the end of a session of Congress. Six of these unsuccessful nominees were subsequently nominated and confirmed to other seats on the Court. Additionally, although confirmed, seven nominees either declined office or (in one instance) died before assuming office.  Question: has any supreme court nominee not been confirmed  Explain your choice.	  Yes, according to the passage, 37 nominees to the Supreme Court of the United States have not been confirmed. This includes 11 nominees who were rejected in Senate roll-call votes, 11 who were withdrawn by the president, and 15 who lapsed at the end of a session of Congress. Additionally, seven nominees were confirmed but either declined office or died before assuming office. So, in total, 37 nominees have not been confirmed to the Supreme Court.	114	
1760568807	1760568809	Passage: Thanksgiving (United States) -- Thanksgiving, or Thanksgiving Day, is a public holiday celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States. It originated as a harvest festival. Thanksgiving has been celebrated nationally on and off since 1789, after Congress requested a proclamation by George Washington. It has been celebrated as a federal holiday every year since 1863, when, during the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a national day of ``Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens,'' to be celebrated on the last Thursday in November. Together with Christmas and the New Year, Thanksgiving is a part of the broader fall/winter holiday season in the U.S.  Question: is thanksgiving always the last thursday of the month  Explain your choice.	  No, Thanksgiving is not always the last Thursday of the month. According to the passage, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States. This means that the date of Thanksgiving can vary depending on the month. For example, if November has 31 days, Thanksgiving will be on the 22nd, 23rd, or 24th. If November has 30 days, Thanksgiving will be on the 21st, 22nd, or 23rd.	123

It is unknown whether the last two novels, Passion and Rapture, and the spin-off novel, Unforgiven, will be adapted as well. In 2017, producer Kevan Van Thompson asked the fans if they want an adaptation of ``Torment'', showing that the sequel still could be made.  Question: is the fallen movie going to have a sequel  Explain your choice.	"  Based on the passage provided, it seems likely that there will be a sequel to the ""Fallen"" movie. The passage mentions that a sequel, ""Torment,"" is in development, and producer Kevan Van Thompson has asked fans if they want an adaptation of the novel. This suggests that there is interest in continuing the story beyond the first movie. Additionally, the passage mentions that the last two novels in the series, ""Passion"" and ""Rapture,"" and a spin-off novel, ""Unforgiven,"" may also be adapted, which further suggests that the franchise is likely to continue."	132

1760568822	1760568823	Passage: Euro sign -- The euro sign (€) is the currency sign used for the euro, the official currency of the Eurozone in the European Union (EU). The design was presented to the public by the European Commission on 12 December 1996. The international three-letter code (according to ISO standard ISO 4217) for the euro is EUR. In Unicode it is encoded at U+20AC € euro sign (HTML &#8364; &euro; ). In English, the sign precedes the value (for instance, €10, not 10 €, unlike most other European languages). In some style guides, but not others, the euro sign is unspaced.  Question: does the euro sign go before the number  Explain your choice.	  Yes, the euro sign goes before the number in the format of displaying the value of the currency. This is the standard convention for displaying the euro, and it is followed by most European languages. In English, the sign is written as € followed by the value, for example, €10. This is in contrast to many other European languages, where the sign is written after the value, for example, 10 €.	89	
1760568823	1760568826	Passage: Induction cooking -- For nearly all models of induction cooktops, a cooking vessel must be made of, or contain, a ferrous metal such as cast iron or some stainless steels. The iron in the pot concentrates the current to produce heat in the metal. If the metal is too thin, or does not provide enough resistance to current flow, heating will not be effective. Most induction tops will not heat copper or aluminum vessels because the magnetic field cannot produce a concentrated current; ``all metal'' induction tops use much higher frequencies to overcome that effect. Any vessel can be used if placed on a suitable metal disk which functions as a conventional hotplate.  Question: can stainless steel be used on induction cooktop  Explain your choice.	"  Yes, stainless steel can be used on an induction cooktop. According to the passage, stainless steel is a ferrous metal, which means it contains iron and can be heated by the magnetic field produced by the induction cooktop. The passage states that ""most induction tops will not heat copper or aluminum vessels because the magnetic field cannot produce a concentrated current,"" but it does not mention stainless steel as a prohibited material.  Therefore, stainless steel can be used on an induction cooktop as long as it is thick enough to provide enough resistance to current flow and can concentrate the magnetic field. The passage does not specify a minimum thickness for stainless steel, but it does mention that if the metal is too thin, heating will not be effective. Therefore, it is important to use a thick enough stainless steel vessel to ensure effective heating."	191	
1760568826	1760568830	Passage: Dismissal (employment) -- ``Firing'' is a common colloquial term in the English language (particularly used in the U.S.) for termination. The term ``firing'' may have been initiated in the 1910s at the National Cash Register Company. Other terms for dismissal are being ``sacked'', ``canned'', ``let go'', ``ran-off'', ``axed'', ``given walking papers'', ``given the pink slip'' or ``boned''. Other terms, more often used in Commonwealth countries, include ``to get the boot'' and ``to get the sack''.  Question: is job termination the same as being fired  Explain your choice.	"  Yes, ""job termination"" and ""firing"" are essentially the same thing. Both terms refer to the act of an employer ending an employee's employment with the organization. The terms are often used interchangeably and have similar meanings, although some people may use them in slightly different contexts or with slightly different connotations.  ""Job termination"" is a more formal and neutral term that simply means the end of an employee's employment with a particular organization. It can be used in a variety of contexts, including layoffs, downsizing, and terminations for cause.  ""Firing,"" on the other hand, is a more colloquial and informal term that is often used to describe the act of terminating an employee's employment, particularly in the United States. It can have a slightly negative connotation, implying that the employer is taking drastic action to end the employee's employment.  In summary, while there is a subtle difference in meaning between ""job termination"" and ""firing,"" they are essentially the same thing and can be used interchangeably in most contexts."	245	
1760568830	1760568834	Passage: Inattentional blindness -- In a 2015 study, Cary Stothart, Walter Boot, and Daniel Simons attempted to replicate and extend the findings from both Graham and Burke's 2011 study and Steven Most and colleague's 2000 study on Amazon Mechanical Turk using a sample of 515 participants that varied in age. In this study, participants were tasked with counting the number of times a number of white moving objects crossed the vertical midpoint of a display while ignoring a number of black moving objects. The unexpected object in this case was a gray cross that moved horizontally across the display at various distances from the vertical midpoint (this was manipulated between participants). Overall, they found that inattentional blindness susceptibility increases with age, which replicates the finding from Graham and Burke. In fact, they found that every 10 years of age was associated with a 1.3 fold increase in the probability of displaying inattentional blindness. They also found that the probability of inattentional blindness increases as the distance between the observer's focus of attention and the unexpected object increases, which replicates the finding from Most and colleagues. However, they also found that the relationship that age has with inattentional blindness does not change as a function of the unexpected object's distance from the focus of attention, suggesting that useful field of view does not mediate the relationship between age and inattentional blindness.  Question: does age have any influence on attentional ability or inattentional blindness  Explain your choice.	  Yes, the passage suggests that age does have an influence on attentional ability and inattentional blindness. The study found that inattentional blindness susceptibility increases with age, with every 10 years of age being associated with a 1.3 fold increase in the probability of displaying inattentional blindness. This suggests that older adults are more prone to inattentional blindness than younger adults.  Additionally, the study found that the relationship between age and inattentional blindness does not change as a function of the unexpected object's distance from the focus of attention, suggesting that useful field of view does not mediate the relationship between age and inattentional blindness. This suggests that the effect of age on inattentional blindness is not due to differences in visual acuity or attention, but rather to other factors such as cognitive decline or changes in attentional abilities that occur with aging.  Overall, the passage suggests that age has a significant influence on attentional ability and inattentional blindness, with older adults being more prone to this phenomenon than younger adults.	250	
1760568834	1760568841	Passage: Sanskrit -- Sanskrit belongs to the Indo-European family of languages. It is one of the three ancient documented languages that likely arose from a common root language now referred to as the Proto-Indo-European language:  Question: is sanskrit the first language of the world  Explain your choice.	  No, Sanskrit is not the first language of the world. The claim that Sanskrit is the first language of the world is a common misconception that has been debunked by linguists and scholars.  Sanskrit is an Indo-European language that emerged in the Indian subcontinent around 1500 BCE, and it is one of the three ancient documented languages that likely arose from a common root language known as Proto-Indo-European. This means that Sanskrit is not the earliest language to have existed, but rather one of the earliest languages to be documented and studied.  The origins of language are still a topic of debate among linguists and scholars, but most research suggests that language evolved gradually over time, with early languages emerging in various parts of the world around 100,000 to 50,000 years ago. Some of the earliest known languages include:  1. Proto-Turkic: Spoken in the region of modern-day Turkey around 6,000 BCE. 2. Proto-Indo-Uralic: Spoken in the region of modern-day Europe around 8,000 BCE. 3. Proto-Boreal: Spoken in the region of modern-day Siberia around 10,000 BCE.  It is important to note that the origins of language are complex and multifaceted, and it is unlikely that any one language can be considered the first language of the world. Language evolution is a gradual process that involves the development of new languages and the spread of existing languages over time, and it is shaped by a variety of factors, including geography, culture, and migration.  In conclusion, while Sanskrit is an important and influential language in the history of human civilization, it is not the first language of the world. The origins of language are complex and multifaceted, and it is unlikely that any one language can be considered the first language of the world.	450	
1760568841	1760568842	Passage: Jack Russell Terrier -- The Jack Russell Terrier is a small terrier that has its origins in fox hunting. It is principally white-bodied and smooth, rough or broken-coated but can be any colour.  Question: is a jack russell considered a small breed  Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the Jack Russell Terrier is considered a small breed. According to the passage, the Jack Russell Terrier is a small terrier, which implies that it is a breed that is smaller in size compared to other terriers. The passage does not provide a specific size range for the breed, but it does mention that the Jack Russell Terrier is ""small,"" which suggests that it is a relatively small breed compared to other dogs."	94	
1760568842	1760568845	Passage: Air Force One -- The Air Force usually does not have fighter aircraft escort the presidential aircraft over the United States but it has occurred, for example during the attack on the World Trade Center.  Question: does air force one travel with fighter escort  Explain your choice.	  No, Air Force One does not typically travel with fighter escorts over the United States. According to the passage, the Air Force usually does not have fighter aircraft escort the presidential aircraft over the United States. This is because the Presidential aircraft, including Air Force One, is typically equipped with advanced security measures and communication systems that allow it to operate safely and securely without the need for additional escorts. Additionally, the Presidential aircraft is often accompanied by other aircraft, such as Air Force cargo planes and helicopters, that provide additional security and support. However, as the passage notes, it has occurred in exceptional circumstances, such as during the attack on the World Trade Center, when fighter escorts may be provided to enhance the President's security.	167	0.8
1760568845	1760568849	Passage: AR-15s in California -- The Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989 banned Colt AR-15 rifles by name in the State of California. California's 2000 Assault Weapons ban went further and banned AR-15s made by other manufacturers by name such as Bushmaster, PWA, and Olympic Arms.  Question: is it legal to own an ar15 in california  Explain your choice.	  Based on the passage provided, it is not legal to own an AR-15 in California unless it meets certain exceptions. The Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989 and the 2000 Assault Weapons ban in California banned Colt AR-15 rifles by name, and later expanded to ban AR-15s made by other manufacturers by name, such as Bushmaster, PWA, and Olympic Arms. This means that any AR-15 that is not specifically exempted from the ban is illegal to own in California.  There are some exceptions to the ban, such as:  1. Firearms that were legally owned and registered before the ban took effect. 2. Firearms that are used for hunting, target shooting, or other lawful purposes. 3. Firearms that are certified as being in compliance with the Assault Weapons Control Act by the California Department of Justice.  It is important to note that the laws regarding firearms in California are complex and subject to change, so it is always best to consult with the California Department of Justice or a legal professional for the most up-to-date information.	264	
1760568849	1760568853	Passage: The Star-Spangled Banner -- ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' is the national anthem of the United States. The lyrics come from ``Defence of Fort M'Henry'', a poem written on September 14, 1814, by the then 35-year-old lawyer and amateur poet Francis Scott Key after witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry by British ships of the Royal Navy in Baltimore Harbor during the Battle of Baltimore in the War of 1812. Key was inspired by the large U.S. flag, with 15 stars and 15 stripes, known as the Star-Spangled Banner, flying triumphantly above the fort during the U.S. victory.  Question: is the national anthem and star spangled banner the same  Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the national anthem and the Star-Spangled Banner are the same. The term ""Star-Spangled Banner"" is actually the title of the poem written by Francis Scott Key, which was later adopted as the national anthem of the United States.  The passage explains that the poem was written on September 14, 1814, after Key witnessed the bombardment of Fort McHenry by British ships during the Battle of Baltimore in the War of 1812. The poem is about the large U.S. flag, known as the Star-Spangled Banner, flying triumphantly above the fort during the U.S. victory.  The national anthem is the term used to refer to the song that is officially recognized and respected as a symbol of a country's identity, culture, and values. In the case of the United States, the national anthem is ""The Star-Spangled Banner.""  So, while the terms ""national anthem"" and ""Star-Spangled Banner"" are sometimes used interchangeably, they actually refer to the same song, which is the official anthem of the United States."	255

1760568855	1760568856	Passage: Cadbury Creme Egg -- Creme eggs are available annually between 1 January and Easter Day. In the UK in the 1980s, Cadbury made Creme Eggs available year-round but sales dropped and they returned to seasonal availability.  Question: can you buy cadburys creme eggs all year round  Explain your choice.	  No, you cannot buy Cadbury Creme Eggs all year round. According to the passage, Creme eggs are only available annually between 1 January and Easter Day in the UK. In the 1980s, Cadbury made Creme Eggs available year-round, but sales dropped, and they returned to seasonal availability. Therefore, it is not possible to purchase Cadbury Creme Eggs outside of the designated season.	99	
1760568856	1760568861	Passage: Homologous chromosome -- A couple of homologous chromosomes, or homologs, are a set of one maternal and one paternal chromosome that pair up with each other inside a cell during meiosis. Homologs have the same genes in the same loci where they provide points along each chromosome which enable a pair of chromosomes to align correctly with each other before separating during meiosis. This is the basis for Mendelian inheritance which characterizes inheritance patterns of genetic material from an organism to its offspring parent developmental cell at the given time and area.  Question: do homologous chromosomes carry information for the same traits  Explain your choice.	  Yes, homologous chromosomes carry information for the same traits. Homologous chromosomes are pairs of chromosomes that are identical in terms of their gene content and location on the chromosome. This means that they carry the same genes and the same genetic information for the same traits or characteristics.  During meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair up and align with each other, and it is this pairing that allows for the proper segregation of genetic material during gametogenesis. The genes on the homologous chromosomes are inherited together, and the combination of these genes determines the expression of certain traits in the offspring.  For example, in humans, the gene for eye color is located on chromosome 15. Both parents contribute a homologous chromosome with the eye color gene to their offspring, and the combination of these genes from the parents determines the eye color of the offspring. Therefore, the eye color of an individual is determined by the combination of genes from the homologous chromosomes inherited from their parents.  In summary, homologous chromosomes carry the same genetic information for the same traits, and it is this information that is inherited from parents to offspring during meiosis.	287

Question: has michigan ever won a national championship in football  Explain your choice.	  Yes, Michigan has won a national championship in football. According to the passage, the Wolverines have won 11 national championships, most recently that of the 1997 squad voted atop the final AP Poll. Therefore, the answer is yes.	58	
1760568861	1760568868	Passage: Waiter Rule -- The Waiter Rule refers to a common belief that one's true character can be gleaned from how one treats staff or service workers, such as a ``waiter''. The rule was one of William H Swanson's 33 Unwritten Rules of Management, copied from Dave Barry's version ``If someone is nice to you but rude to the waiter, they are not a nice person.''  Question: you can tell a lot about a person by how they treat their waiter  Explain your choice.	  Sure! Here's why I think the passage chooses to emphasize the Waiter Rule:  1. Reveals character traits: The passage suggests that a person's character can be judged based on how they treat service workers, such as waiters. This implies that a person's behavior towards others, especially those who are often marginalized or overlooked, can reveal their true character. 2. Practical application: The Waiter Rule is a practical application of the idea that actions speak louder than words. By observing how a person treats service workers, it's easier to gauge their level of empathy, kindness, and respect towards others. 3. Relates to everyday life: The Waiter Rule is something that people can relate to in their everyday lives. Most people have had experiences with service workers, and the way they treat them can be a reflection of their overall character. 4. Simple and memorable: The Waiter Rule is a simple and memorable phrase that highlights the importance of treating others with respect and kindness. It's easy to remember and can be used as a quick reminder to be mindful of one's behavior towards service workers. 5. Reinforces the idea of consistency: By suggesting that a person's behavior towards service workers is a reflection of their true character, the passage reinforces the idea that consistency is key to understanding a person's character. If a person consistently treats service workers with respect and kindness, it's likely that they are a kind and respectful person overall.  Overall, the passage chooses to emphasize the Waiter Rule because it provides a practical and relatable example of how a person's behavior can reveal their true character, and it reinforces the idea of consistency in evaluating a person's character.	399	
1760568868	1760568869	Passage: American crocodile -- Within the United States, the American crocodile's distribution is limited to the southern tip of Florida, though at least two have been found as far north as the Tampa Bay area. The current US population, estimated at 2,000, represents a significant recovery from a few hundred in the 1970s.  Question: are there any crocodiles native to north america  Explain your choice.	  No, there are no native crocodiles in North America. The passage states that the American crocodile is the only species of crocodile found within the United States, and its distribution is limited to the southern tip of Florida. The passage also mentions that at least two American crocodiles have been found as far north as the Tampa Bay area, but this does not indicate that there are any other species of crocodiles native to North America. Therefore, the answer is no, there are no native crocodiles in North America.	113	
1760568869	1760568873	Passage: Lex Luthor (Smallville) -- Season seven displayed Lex's descent into darkness; he has a brother-like relationship with Grant Gabriel (Michael Cassidy), the new editor of the Daily Planet newest editor, until it's revealed Grant is actually a clone of Lex's late brother. After Lex buys the Daily Planet, Grant attempts to keep Lex from being controlling, thus Lex has his brother's clone murdered and staged as a failed mugging. Lex then discovers that the previous symbols are connected to the secret organization Veritas, which his father is a part of. The Veritas members learned that an alien visitor known as ``The Traveler'' would arrive in Smallville during the meteor shower of 1989. At this time, Lex realizes that Lionel has been covering up the Traveler's existence and subsequently kills his own father for it. He eventually discovers that the Veritas members knew of a means to control the Traveler, so Lex sets out to find the device. The device, an orb he finds in the mantle above a fireplace in the Luthor mansion, leads Lex to the Fortress of Solitude, where he is confronted by Clark. Having finally discovered Clark's secret, Lex uses the orb to bring down the Fortress around Clark and himself.  Question: does lex luthor know who superman is in smallville  Explain your choice.	  Based on the passage provided, it is not explicitly stated whether Lex Luthor knows who Superman is in Smallville. However, it is heavily implied that he does.  In the passage, Lex is shown to be obsessed with uncovering the truth about the Traveler and the Veritas organization, which suggests that he has a deep understanding of the supernatural events that have been occurring in Smallville. He also discovers that his father, Lionel, has been covering up the existence of the Traveler, which implies that Lex is aware of the supernatural nature of the events in Smallville.  Furthermore, when Lex discovers the device that leads him to the Fortress of Solitude, he is able to use it to bring down the Fortress and confront Clark, suggesting that he has a deep understanding of Clark's powers and abilities.  Given these clues, it is likely that Lex Luthor is aware of Superman's true identity as Clark Kent in Smallville.	212	
1760568873	1760568875	Passage: Admission to the bar in the United States -- In the canonical case, lawyers seeking admission must earn a Juris Doctor degree from a law school approved by the jurisdiction, and then pass a bar exam administered by it. Typically, there is also a character and fitness evaluation, which includes a background check. However, there are exceptions to each of these requirements. A lawyer who is admitted in one state is not automatically allowed to practice in any other. Some states have reciprocal agreements that allow attorneys from other states to practice without sitting for another full bar exam; such agreements differ significantly among the states.  Question: do you have to have a college degree to take the bar exam  Explain your choice.	  No, you do not necessarily need a college degree to take the bar exam in the United States. According to the passage, lawyers seeking admission to the bar must earn a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from a law school approved by the jurisdiction, but there is no mention of a college degree requirement. In fact, some law schools offer special programs for non-traditional students, such as those who have earned a degree in a field other than law, or who have significant work experience in a related field. These programs can help prepare students for the bar exam and the practice of law, even if they do not have a traditional college degree.	139

1760568886	1760568888	Passage: Liquid latex -- As the latex dries it becomes very sticky and will stick to itself if accidentally folded over. Most manufacturers offer a slick spray for latex once it is dry to take away the stickiness allowing the movement of the model's limbs. Alternatively, shimmer powders can be dusted over dried liquid latex to create metallic effects. One advantage to the tackiness of liquid latex is that it can act as an adhesive to attach things to the paint, such as zippers.  Question: can liquid latex be used as an adhesive  Explain your choice.	  Yes, liquid latex can be used as an adhesive. According to the passage, the tackiness of liquid latex can act as an adhesive to attach things to the paint, such as zippers. This is because the drying liquid latex becomes very sticky and can bond with other materials, allowing for the attachment of objects to the painted surface.
