"In Sentence 1, ""run"" is a verb that means to behave or move without control or restraint, often in a wild or unbridled manner. In this sense, ""run"" is used to describe a person's behavior, implying that they are acting impulsively or uncontrollably.  In Sentence 2, ""ran"" is also a verb, but it means to move quickly on foot, typically with a sense of effort or exertion. In this sense, ""ran"" is used to describe an action, specifically the physical act of moving one's legs to cover a certain distance.

In Sentence 1, ""run"" is used to describe a state of being or a manner of behavior, whereas in Sentence 2, ""ran"" is used to describe a specific action or event.

This usage is a common idiomatic expression in horse racing, where a horse is said to have ""won by a head"" if it finishes just ahead of another horse by a short distance.  In Sentence 2, ""head"" refers to a human head, specifically the upper part of the human body that contains the brain, eyes, ears, and other organs. In this context, ""heads"" is a plural noun, indicating the number of heads (i.e., individual humans) being compared.  So, while the word ""head"" appears in both sentences, its meaning is different in each case. In Sentence 1, ""head"" is a unit of measurement, while in Sentence 2, it refers to a human head."	209	
1760575964	1760575967	"Does the word ""meet"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: The company agrees to meet the cost of any repairs. Sentence 2: This proposal meets my requirements.  Explain your choice."	"In Sentence 1, ""meet"" is used as a verb, meaning to equal or match something. The company is agreeing to pay the same amount as the cost of the repairs, so the sentence is saying that the company will pay the same amount as the cost of the repairs.  In Sentence 2, ""meet"" is used as a verb, but it has a different meaning. It means to satisfy or fulfill something. The proposal is not paying or matching a cost, but rather it is satisfying or fulfilling the requirements.  So, while both sentences use the same word ""meet"", they have different meanings. In Sentence 1, ""meet"" is used to indicate equality or matching, while in Sentence 2, it is used to indicate satisfaction or fulfillment.  Therefore, I would say that the word ""meet"" does not have the same meaning in the two sentences."	180

So, my answer is: No, the word ""narrowness"" does not have the same meaning in the two sentences."	165	
1760575972	1760575975	"Does the word ""act"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: The governor should act on the new energy bill. Sentence 2: Think before you act.  Explain your choice."	"In Sentence 1, ""act"" means ""to take action"" or ""to respond"" to the new energy bill. It implies that the governor should take concrete steps or make a decision regarding the bill.  In Sentence 2, ""act"" means ""to do something"" or ""to perform an action"", but it also carries a connotation of impulsivity or without careful consideration. It's cautioning someone to think carefully before making a decision or taking an action.  So, while the word ""act"" is the same in both sentences, its meaning and connotation are slightly different. In Sentence 1, it's more about taking a deliberate action, whereas in Sentence 2, it's about taking an action without fully thinking through the consequences.  In linguistic terms, this is an example of a polyseme, where a single word has multiple related meanings, but with subtle differences in connotation and usage."	189	
1760575975	1760575978	"Does the word ""cover"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: Cover her face with a handkerchief.

Explain your choice."	"In Sentence 1, ""finish"" means the final stage or quality of something, in this case, the boat's surface, which is described as metallic. It implies that the boat has a surface that has been treated or coated with a metallic material.  In Sentence 2, ""finish"" refers to a type of coating or layer that is applied to a surface to protect or enhance it. It is a noun, specifically a type of material or substance used to finish or complete a surface.  So, while the word ""finish"" is used in both sentences, it has different meanings.

Sentence 1: The farmer's field was a civil war battleground, and relics such a minnie bullets were frequently found while plowing. Sentence 2: Field of view.  Explain your choice."	"What a great question!  In Sentence 1, ""field"" refers to a piece of land used for agriculture, specifically a farm or a plot of land used for growing crops. In this context, the word ""field"" has a concrete, physical meaning, referring to a specific geographic location.  In Sentence 2, ""field"" is a noun phrase ""Field of view"", which is a metaphorical or abstract concept. In this case, ""field"" refers to the range of vision or the area that can be seen at one time, without any physical connection to a piece of land.  So, while the word ""field"" is used in both sentences, it has different meanings. In Sentence 1, it's a concrete, physical location, while in Sentence 2, it's an abstract, conceptual idea.  Therefore, I would say that the word ""field"" does not have the same meaning in the two sentences."	192

Here, ""make"" means to cause or bring about something, often in a sense of creating a situation or effect.

In Sentence 1, ""make"" is used to convey the idea of creation or construction, whereas in Sentence 2, it's used to convey the idea of causation or bringing about a situation.

Explain your choice."	"What a great question!  In Sentence 1, ""strike"" means to hit or strike a medal with something, likely a hammer or other tool, in order to shape or shape-sharpen it. The word ""strike"" here is a transitive verb, taking the medal as its direct object.  In Sentence 2, ""strike"" is a verb meaning to cause a sudden and fatal blow or injury, often with great force. The word ""strike"" here is also a transitive verb, but its object is the attacker, not a physical object like a medal.  So, while the word ""strike"" is the same in both sentences, its meaning and grammatical function are different. In Sentence 1, ""strike"" is used in a more literal sense, whereas in Sentence 2, it's used in a more figurative sense to convey a violent and deadly action.  In summary, the word ""strike"" has different meanings in these two sentences, despite being the same word."	206

In Sentence 1, it's more about the physical arrangement of people or objects, while in Sentence 2, it's more about the sequence of people waiting in a queue.  Therefore, I would say that the word ""line"" has a slightly different meaning in each sentence, although the core idea of a sequence or arrangement is present in both cases."	226	
1760576012	1760576015	"Does the word ""create"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: You can create the color orange by mixing yellow and red. Sentence 2: The company was created 25 years ago.  Explain your choice."	"What a great question!

In this case, you are combining yellow and red to produce the color orange, which didn't exist before. This is an example of creative action, where you are actively making something new.  In the second sentence, ""created"" is a passive verb, meaning to have been brought into existence or established. The company didn't exist before and then suddenly appeared; it was intentionally founded or established 25 years ago. This is an example of an event or a state of being that has been brought into existence, rather than an active creative process.  So, while both sentences use the same word ""create"", the meaning is different in each sentence. In the first sentence, ""create"" is an active verb, while in the second sentence, it is a passive verb."	187

In the first sentence, the focus is on the physical act of pouring or releasing a liquid, whereas in the second sentence, the focus is on the act of revealing or sharing information.

Here, ""beat"" means to move faster than or arrive before something else, often with a sense of competition or urgency. In this context, ""beat"" is more like a synonym of ""outdo"" or ""surpass"".  So, while both sentences use the word ""beat"", they have different meanings. In Sentence 1, the focus is on the action of striking or tapping, while in Sentence 2, the focus is on moving faster or arriving ahead of something else.

Explain your choice."	"What a great question!  In Sentence 1, ""voice"" means ""the official or authoritative expression of a rule, principle, or institution"". In this sense, ""the voice of the law"" refers to the law itself, its essence, or its authority.  In Sentence 2, ""voices"" is a plural noun, referring to multiple individuals or entities that express their opinions, ideas, or perspectives. Here, ""voices"" means ""different opinions, views, or opinions"".  So, while ""voice"" has a similar form in both sentences, its meaning is different.

In Sentence 2, ""hit"" also means to strike or make contact with something, but in this case, it's a baseball. In baseball, a ""home run"" is a type of score, and ""hit"" is used figuratively to mean scoring a run by hitting the ball in a certain way. In this context, ""hit"" is being used in a more figurative sense, indicating success or achievement.  So, while the verb ""hit"" is used in both sentences, its meaning is slightly different in each sentence. In Sentence 1, it's a literal action, while in Sentence 2, it's a figurative expression."	177	
1760576031	1760576033	"Does the word ""study"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: He knocked lightly on the closed door of the study. Sentence 2: He is a quick study.

In Sentence 1, ""land"" refers to the act of setting down, whereas in Sentence 2, it means to catch or capture.  Therefore, I would say that the word ""land"" does not have the same meaning in these two sentences."	193	
1760576036	1760576041	"Does the word ""make"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: They make a cute couple. Sentence 2: One swallow does not a summer make.  Explain your choice."	"What a great question!  In Sentence 1, ""make"" is a transitive verb, which means it takes an object. In this case, the object is ""a cute couple"". The verb ""make"" means to create or form something, and in this sentence, it implies that the two individuals being referred to are a cute and harmonious pair.  In Sentence 2, ""make"" is also a verb, but it's an idiomatic expression, which means it has a non-literal meaning that's specific to the phrase. In this case, ""make"" is used in the phrase ""one swallow does not a summer make"", which is a common English idiom that means ""one event or incident does not necessarily determine the outcome of a larger situation"". The phrase is derived from a quote by the ancient Roman poet Juvenal, who wrote ""One swallow does not a summer make"" to express the idea that just because one day is hot, it doesn't mean that the entire summer will be hot.  So, while both sentences use the word ""make"", they have different meanings. In Sentence 1, ""make"" means to create or form something, whereas in Sentence 2, it's used idiomatically to convey a different idea."	259	
1760576041	1760576044	"Does the word ""material"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: She was vice-presidential material. Sentence 2: He was university material.  Explain your choice."	"In both sentences, the word ""material"" has a slightly different meaning, although related.  In Sentence 1, ""vice-presidential material"" means that the person has the qualities, skills, and abilities that would make them a suitable candidate for the office of Vice President. In this sense, ""material"" is being used to describe someone's potential or suitability for a role.  In Sentence 2, ""university material"" is likely being used in a more idiomatic sense, meaning that the person has the academic abilities, qualifications, or characteristics that would make them a good fit for a university setting or program. In this sense, ""material"" is being used to describe someone's aptitude or potential for academic success.  While both sentences use the word ""material"", the meaning is slightly different in each case. In Sentence 1, ""material"" is more focused on the person's potential for a specific role or position, whereas in Sentence 2, it's more focused on their academic abilities or qualities."	208	
1760576044	1760576049	"Does the word ""fatigue"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: He was suffering from museum fatigue. Sentence 2: The American public is experiencing scandal fatigue.  Explain your choice."	"What a great question!  In both sentences, the word ""fatigue"" refers to a state of mental or emotional exhaustion, but the underlying concept is slightly different.  In Sentence 1, ""museum fatigue"" is a metaphorical expression that refers to a feeling of boredom, disinterest, or exhaustion caused by overexposure to museums, art, or cultural institutions. It implies that the person has visited too many museums or seen too many exhibits, leading to a sense of mental fatigue.  In Sentence 2, ""scandal fatigue"" is a more literal expression that refers to a widespread feeling of emotional exhaustion or numbness caused by the constant stream of scandals, controversies, or negative news in the public sphere. It implies that the public has been overwhelmed by the frequency and intensity of scandals, leading to a sense of emotional fatigue.  While both sentences share the idea of exhaustion, the context and connotation are distinct. In Sentence 1, the focus is on the individual's experience of boredom, while in Sentence 2, the focus is on the collective experience of the public.  So, while the word ""fatigue"" has a similar meaning in both sentences, the context and nuances of the phrases are different, and the word takes on slightly different shades of meaning."	262

Sentence 2: In the living room there was a tank of colorful fish.  Explain your choice."	"In Sentence 1, ""fish"" refers to a member of the class Pisces, a group of aquatic animals that include species such as salmon, tuna, and cod. In this context, the word ""fish"" is used as a noun to refer to a specific type of animal.  In Sentence 2, ""fish"" refers to the plural form of the noun ""fish"" that we just discussed, but in this case, it's used to refer to the plural noun ""fish"" as a collective term for a group of fish, such as goldfish, guppies, or neon tetras. In this context, ""fish"" is being used to refer to a group of fish kept in a tank, rather than a specific species or type of fish.  So, while the word ""fish"" is the same in both sentences, its meaning and usage are slightly different. In Sentence 1, it's being used as a noun to refer to a specific type of animal, while in Sentence 2, it's being used as a collective noun to refer to a group of fish."	223

In Sentence 1, ""begin"" means to start or initiate a new phase or period of one's life. It implies a significant change, a fresh start, or a new beginning. For example, starting a new job, a new relationship, or a new chapter in one's life.  In Sentence 2, ""begin"" means to start smoking a cigar. It implies taking the first puff or taking the initial steps to engage in the activity of smoking a cigar.  So, while the word ""begin"" is the same, its meaning is more abstract in Sentence 1, referring to a significant life event, and more concrete in Sentence 2, referring to a specific action.  In summary, while the word ""begin"" is the same, its meaning is nuanced and context-dependent, and the two sentences convey different shades of meaning."	202

It's the realm of stars, planets, and galaxies, where the laws of physics are different from those on Earth.

So, to answer your question, the word ""space"" does not have the same meaning in these two sentences. In the first sentence, it refers to a physical location or area, while in the second sentence, it refers to a vast, celestial expanse."	232	
1760576063	1760576066	"Does the word ""shot"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: He is still recovering from a shot to his leg. Sentence 2: I caught him with a solid shot to the chin.  Explain your choice."	"In Sentence 1, ""shot"" refers to a bullet wound, which is a type of injury caused by a projectile. In this context, the word ""shot"" is a noun, and it refers to the act of firing a projectile (in this case, a bullet) that has caused harm to the person's leg.

Sentence 2: We must not let our civil liberties be subverted by the current crisis.  Explain your choice."	"In Sentence 1, ""subvert"" means to turn something upside down or to change its original purpose or direction. In this context, it implies that school counselors are manipulating or distorting their role or responsibilities in some way, possibly to serve their own interests or goals rather than the best interests of the children.  In Sentence 2, ""subvert"" means to undermine or overthrow something, often in a secretive or insidious manner. In this context, it implies that the current crisis is attempting to secretly or quietly erode or destroy the civil liberties that are supposed to be protected and upheld.  So, while both sentences use the word ""subvert"", they have different meanings. In Sentence 1, it implies a more subtle or indirect manipulation, whereas in Sentence 2, it implies a more overt and intentional attempt to destroy something."	172	
1760576068	1760576071	"Does the word ""academy"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: A riding academy. Sentence 2: Academies of literature and philology.  Explain your choice."	"In Sentence 1, ""academy"" refers to a school or institution that teaches riding, specifically horse riding. In this sense, the word ""academy"" is being used as a noun to refer to a specific type of educational institution or organization.

In this sense, the word ""academy"" is being used to refer to a type of research institution or organization that is dedicated to the study of these subjects.

For example, ""The bucket catches rainwater from the roof.""

Sentence 2: There stood on the corner a statue.  Explain your choice."	"What a great question!  In Sentence 1, ""stand"" is a verb, and it means to be in a position or posture, often with a sense of determination or firmness. The speaker is indicating their physical stance, as if they are literally standing in place, but also conveying a sense of resolve or resolve. In this context, ""stand"" implies a sense of agency and decision-making.  In Sentence 2, ""stood"" is also a verb, but it is in the past tense and has a different meaning. ""Stood"" is the past tense of ""stand"", and it means to be situated or located in a particular place. In this sentence, the focus is on the statue's location, not on any action or decision-making. The statue is simply situated on the corner, without any sense of agency or intention.  So, to answer your question, the word ""stand"" does not have the same meaning in both sentences. In Sentence 1, it's about the speaker's physical and emotional state, while in Sentence 2, it's about the statue's location."	226

Therefore, my answer is: no, the word ""hit"" does not have the same meaning in these two sentences."	227

So, while the word ""carry"" is the same in both sentences, its meaning is different.

Sentence 2: The voice of the law.  Explain your choice."	"What a great question!  In the first sentence, ""a still small voice"" is an idiomatic expression that refers to a gentle, quiet, and often subtle or mysterious sound or message. In this context, ""voice"" is used metaphorically to describe a gentle, whispery, or soft utterance that is not loud or boisterous. The phrase is often used to describe a divine or supernatural voice, as in this biblical passage.  In the second sentence, ""the voice of the law"" is a literal expression that refers to the actual words or commands of a law or regulation.

In the first sentence, ""voice"" is used metaphorically to describe a gentle sound or message, whereas in the second sentence, it is used literally to describe the words or commands of a law.  Therefore, I would say that the word ""voice"" does not have the same meaning in these two sentences."	225

The phrase ""cycle of the seasons"" implies that the sequence of spring, summer, autumn, and winter repeats itself in a predictable and finite manner. The word ""cycle"" here suggests a natural, harmonious, and balanced process.  In Sentence 2, ""cycle"" is used to convey a sense of repetition without end or completion. The phrase ""never-ending cycle"" implies that the sequence of seasons repeats itself indefinitely, without a clear beginning or end. The word ""cycle"" here suggests a sense of monotony, monotony, or even frustration.  So, while the word ""cycle"" has the same basic meaning in both sentences, the context and connotation differ. In Sentence 1, ""cycle"" implies a natural and balanced process, while in Sentence 2, it implies a sense of repetition without end."	243

This usage of ""round"" is related to the idea of something moving or circulating from one place to another, rather than a literal cycle or rotation.  So, while both sentences use the word ""round,"" they have different meanings. In Sentence 1, ""round"" refers to a cycle or rotation, while in Sentence 2, it refers to the circulation or spread of information."	168	
1760576130	1760576133	"Does the word ""roll"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: Roll out the paper. Sentence 2: The drawer rolled open.  Explain your choice."	"In Sentence 1, ""roll"" is a verb that means to unroll or unfold something, such as a piece of paper or a blanket. In this context, the word ""roll"" is used to describe the action of making something flat and extended.  In Sentence 2, ""roll"" is a verb that means to move or turn around a central axis, often with a smooth and continuous motion. In this context, the word ""roll"" is used to describe the action of the drawer moving from a closed to an open position.  So, while both sentences use the same word ""roll"", they have different meanings and connotations. In Sentence 1, ""roll"" implies a more static action of unrolling, whereas in Sentence 2, ""roll"" implies a dynamic action of movement.  Therefore, I would say that the word ""roll"" does not have the same meaning in the two sentences."	188	
1760576133	1760576137	"Does the word ""be"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: I shall be writing to you soon. Sentence 2: 3 times 5 is fifteen.  Explain your choice."	"What a great question!  In Sentence 1, ""be"" is a linking verb, also known as a copula. It is connecting the subject ""I"" to the predicate ""writing to you soon"". In this context, ""be"" is indicating the state of being or the action of writing to the listener. The sentence is saying that the speaker plans to perform the action of writing to the listener at some point in the future.  In Sentence 2, ""be"" is not a linking verb. It is not connecting a subject to a predicate, but rather it is part of the verb phrase ""is"" (or ""be"" in the present tense). In this context, ""be"" is a copula in a different sense, indicating the state of being of the mathematical equation. The sentence is stating that the product of 3 and 5 is equal to 15, and ""is"" is connecting the left-hand side of the equation to the right-hand side.  So, while the word ""be"" appears in both sentences, it has different meanings and functions in each sentence. In Sentence 1, ""be"" is a linking verb, while in Sentence 2, it is part of a copula verb phrase."	254	
1760576137	1760576140	"Does the word ""laugh"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: Paul laughed a cheerful laugh. Sentence 2: She laughed her excitement.  Explain your choice."	"In Sentence 1, ""laugh"" is a verb, and it means to produce a sound of joy or amusement, often accompanied by a physical expression of happiness, such as a smile or a chuckle.  In Sentence 2, ""laugh"" is not a verb, but rather a noun. In this case, ""laugh"" refers to the emotion or feeling of amusement or joy that someone is experiencing, rather than the sound or physical action of laughing. The phrase ""laugh of excitement"" is an idiomatic expression that means a joyful or enthusiastic response to something, often accompanied by a feeling of euphoria or elation.  So, while the word ""laugh"" is used in both sentences, it has different meanings and functions in each sentence. In Sentence 1, ""laugh"" is a verb, and in Sentence 2, it's a noun."	182	
1760576140	1760576143	"Does the word ""reach"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: Our advertisements reach millions. Sentence 2: His hand reaches the river.  Explain your choice."	"What a great question!  In both sentences, the word ""reach"" is used, but its meaning is different.  In Sentence 1, ""reach"" is a verb meaning ""to extend or spread out to cover or affect a large number of people or things"". In this context, the advertisements are spreading out to cover millions of people, making them accessible or visible to that many individuals.  In Sentence 2, ""reach"" is also a verb, but it means ""to extend or stretch out to a particular point or distance"". In this context, the hand is stretching out to physically touch or come into contact with the river.  So, while the word ""reach"" is used in both sentences, its meaning is different in each sentence. In the first sentence, it's about spreading out or covering a large number of people, while in the second sentence, it's about extending or stretching out physically."	187	
1760576143	1760576146	"Does the word ""wall"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: A wall of prejudice. Sentence 2: The container's walls were blue.  Explain your choice."	"In Sentence 1, ""wall"" refers to a metaphorical or figurative concept, where ""prejudice"" is being used to describe a barrier or obstacle that separates or divides people. In this sense, ""wall"" is being used to convey the idea of a psychological or emotional barrier that prevents people from understanding or connecting with each other.  In Sentence 2, ""wall"" has a literal meaning, referring to the physical structure that forms the boundary of a container. In this case, ""wall"" is a tangible, physical entity that surrounds and encloses the contents of the container.  So, while the word ""wall"" is used in both sentences, it has different meanings and connotations in each context. In Sentence 1, ""wall"" is a metaphor, while in Sentence 2, it is a literal object."	172	
1760576146	1760576149	"Does the word ""change"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: The change was intended to increase sales. Sentence 2: This storm is certainly a change for the worse.  Explain your choice."	"In Sentence 1, ""change"" refers to a modification or alteration made to something, in this case, a policy or strategy intended to increase sales. In this sense, ""change"" means to make something different or to modify it in some way.  In Sentence 2, ""change"" means a sudden or unexpected event or circumstance that has a significant impact. In this sense, ""change"" refers to a transformation or a shift from one state or condition to another, often for the worse.  So, while both sentences use the word ""change"", they have different meanings. In Sentence 1, ""change"" is a noun referring to an intentional modification, while in Sentence 2, ""change"" is a noun referring to an unexpected event or transformation.  Therefore, I would argue that the word ""change"" does not have the same meaning in the two sentences."	179	
1760576149	1760576153	"Does the word ""baby"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: This project is his baby. Sentence 2: Stand up for yourself-don't be such a baby!  Explain your choice."	"What a great question!  In Sentence 1, ""baby"" is used as a metaphorical expression meaning ""something that someone is particularly proud of, responsible for, or has a strong emotional attachment to"". For example, ""This project is his baby"" means that the speaker is saying that the project is a personal and important endeavor for the person being referred to, and they have a strong emotional investment in its success.  In Sentence 2, ""baby"" is used as a slang expression to mean ""someone who is behaving in an immature or weak manner"". For example, ""Stand up for yourself - don't be such a baby!"" is telling someone to stop being overly sensitive, whiny, or cowardly, and to take a stronger stance.  So, in short, the word ""baby"" has different meanings in the two sentences. In Sentence 1, it's a positive term of endearment, while in Sentence 2, it's a pejorative term implying immaturity."	205	
1760576153	1760576156	"Does the word ""break"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: I don't know how to break this to you, but your cat is not coming back. Sentence 2: When news of their divorce broke, ...  Explain your choice."	"In Sentence 1, ""break"" means to inform or tell someone something unpleasant or difficult.

It is in the past tense, indicating that the news of their divorce happened or became known at some point in the past. In this context, ""broke"" is a synonym of ""happened"" or ""became public"".  So, while the word ""break"" is the same in both sentences, its meaning is different. In Sentence 1, it's used to describe the act of telling someone something, while in Sentence 2, it's used to describe the event of news becoming known."	167	
1760576156	1760576159	"Does the word ""score"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: Settling a score. Sentence 2: The player with the highest score is the winner.  Explain your choice."	"In Sentence 1, ""score"" means a personal vendetta or a debt to be repaid, often with reference to a past conflict or injustice. For example, ""I've been waiting to settle the score with my rival for years.""  In Sentence 2, ""score"" refers to a numerical value or a point total, often used to measure performance, achievement, or progress. For example, ""The player with the highest score is the winner of the game.""  So, while the word ""score"" is the same in both sentences, its meaning is different. In Sentence 1, it's used in the figurative sense, while in Sentence 2, it's used in a more literal sense to refer to a numerical value.  In linguistics, this is an example of a polyseme, where a word has multiple related meanings. The word ""score"" has multiple meanings, and the context helps disambiguate the intended meaning."	197	
1760576159	1760576162	"Does the word ""close"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: The owners decided to move and to close the factory.

In Sentence 2, ""connection"" means a cause-and-effect relationship or a link between two events, in this case, between going out last night and the headache. It implies that the headache is a direct or indirect result of going out last night.  So, while the word ""connection"" is the same in both sentences, its meaning is different. In Sentence 1, it refers to a general relationship or association, whereas in Sentence 2, it refers to a specific causal link.  In linguistics, this difference in meaning is known as a semantic difference, where the same word has different meanings depending on the context in which it is used."	175	
1760576165	1760576169	"Does the word ""go"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: Go about the world in a certain manner.

For example, ""We should go farther in this matter"" means that we should continue to make progress or advance in this particular issue or project.  So, while both sentences use the word ""go"", they have different meanings. In Sentence 1, ""go"" is about manner or behavior, whereas in Sentence 2, ""go"" is about movement or progression.  In summary, the word ""go"" has different meanings in these two sentences, and the context is what helps disambiguate the meaning."	231

In the first sentence, it's a physical action related to aviation, while in the second sentence, it's a figurative expression meaning to get someone into a particular predicament.  In linguistic terms, this is an example of polysemy, where a single word has multiple related or unrelated meanings."	193	
1760576181	1760576183	"Does the word ""rake"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: Rake gravel. Sentence 2: The gunfire raked the coast.  Explain your choice."	"No, the word ""rake"" has different meanings in the two sentences.

1760576183	1760576186	"Does the word ""quality"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: ""The quality of mercy is not strained"" -- Shakespeare. Sentence 2: While being impulsive can be great for artists, it is not a desirable quality for engineers.  Explain your choice."

The sentence is saying that being impulsive is not a desirable characteristic for engineers, implying that it's not a positive or useful trait for someone in that profession.

In Sentence 1, ""quality"" is used to describe an abstract concept, whereas in Sentence 2, it's used to describe a personal trait or characteristic."	184	
1760576186	1760576189	"Does the word ""hold"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: To carry well, i.e. to hold the head high, with arching neck. Sentence 2: She holds her head high.  Explain your choice."	"While both sentences use the word ""hold"", they do not have the same meaning.  In Sentence 1, ""hold"" is used as a verb in the phrase ""to carry well"", which means to bear or sustain something (in this case, the head) in a certain way. It's describing the posture or carriage of the head, with the implication that the person is holding their head upright and proud.

"In the first sentence, ""image"" refers to the output or result of the function f when the input is 3. In other words, it is the value that f(3) takes. This is a specific value, which is 6 in this case.  In the second sentence, ""image"" refers to the set of all possible outputs or results of the function f(x) = x^2, when the input is any real number. This is a set of values, not a single value. The image is the range of the function, which is the set of all non-negative real numbers in this case.  So, while the word ""image"" is used in both sentences, it has different meanings. In the first sentence, it refers to a specific output value, while in the second sentence, it refers to the set of all possible output values."	178	
1760576192	1760576195	"Does the word ""tell"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: He could tell that she was unhappy. Sentence 2: She told him how he did it.  Explain your choice."	"No, the word ""tell"" does not have the same meaning in the two sentences.  In Sentence 1, ""tell"" is a verb that means ""to perceive or infer"" (Oxford English Dictionary). The sentence means that he was able to sense or notice that she was unhappy, likely through her behavior, facial expression, or tone of voice.  In Sentence 2, ""tell"" is a verb that means ""to communicate or reveal information"" (Oxford English Dictionary).
