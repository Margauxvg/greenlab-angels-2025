Explain your choice."	"No, ""He"" does not refer to ""Mr. Singer"". The sentence structure and context suggest that ""He"" refers to Mark, who is described as being ""close to Mr. Singer's heels"".  The sentence starts with ""Mark was close to Mr. Singer's heels"", which establishes that Mark is physically close to Mr. Singer. The verb ""heard"" in the next clause implies that Mark is the one who heard Mr. Singer calling for the captain, which further supports the conclusion that ""He"" refers to Mark."	109	
1760486305	1760486309	"The pony behaved well, sir, and showed no vice; but at last he just threw up his heels and tipped the young gentleman into the thorn hedge. He wanted me to help him out, but I hope you will excuse me, sir, I did not feel inclined to do so.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""young gentleman""? Explain your choice."	"A clever question!  After analyzing the sentence, I believe ""He"" refers to the pony, not the young gentleman. Here's why:  * The sentence starts by describing the pony's behavior, saying ""The pony behaved well, sir, and showed no vice..."" This suggests that ""He"" is likely referring to the pony. * The phrase ""He just threw up his heels and tipped the young gentleman into the thorn hedge"" implies that the pony is the one performing the action, and the young gentleman is the one being affected by it. * The sentence then says ""He wanted me to help him out"", which is a pronoun reference that is likely referring back to the pony, as it is the one that needs help.  So, while the young gentleman is the one who is affected by the pony's behavior, ""He"" in this sentence is indeed referring to the pony."	183	
1760486309	1760486310	"I poured water from the bottle into the cup until it was full.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""the cup""? Explain your choice."

1760486324	1760486327	"When Tommy dropped his ice cream, Timmy giggled, so father gave him a sympathetic look.  In the sentence above, does ""him"" refer to ""Timmy""? Explain your choice."	"A classic ambiguity!  At first glance, it seems like ""him"" should refer to ""Timmy"", as it's the one who giggled. However, the sentence structure and word order suggest that ""him"" actually refers to ""Tommy"", the one who dropped the ice cream.  The sentence is structured as ""When X happened, Y did Z, so Z did A"". In this case, ""When Tommy dropped his ice cream"" is the condition, ""Timmy giggled"" is the action, and ""father gave him a sympathetic look"" is the consequence. The subject of the sentence is the one who receives the action (the look), which is ""him"", which logically refers to Tommy, the one who dropped the ice cream.  So, while it's tempting to assume ""him"" refers to Timmy, the context and sentence structure indicate that it actually refers to Tommy."	184	
1760486327	1760486329	"After I saw Bill catching flies and pulling off their wings, I boxed his ears. I showed the master the flies, some crushed and some crawling about helpless, and I showed him the wings on the window sill.

"Yes, in the sentence ""he did not give him any more punishment of that kind, but set him up on a stool for the rest of the afternoon, and said that he should not go out to play for that week."", ""he"" refers to ""the master"".

"In this sentence, ""it"" does not refer to ""the newspaper"". Instead, ""it"" refers to the rain.  The sentence can be broken down as follows:  * ""Since it was raining"" - This clause sets the condition for the subsequent action. * ""I carried the newspaper over my backpack to keep it dry."" - The action of carrying the newspaper is done because of the rain.

In the sentence, ""him"" is the object of the verb ""served"", and it refers back to ""the boy"". The sentence is saying that the boy got what he deserved, i.e., being thrown off the pony.  The use of ""him"" instead of ""the boy"" is an example of a pronoun referring back to a noun that was previously mentioned, which is a common grammatical construction in English."	102	
1760486342	1760486344	"I put the cake away in the refrigerator . It has a lot of leftovers in it.  In the sentence above, does ""It"" refer to ""The cake""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""It"" refers to ""the refrigerator"".  The reason is that the subject of the sentence is ""I"", and ""put the cake away in the refrigerator"" is the action being performed by ""I"". The phrase ""in the refrigerator"" is a prepositional phrase that modifies the verb ""put"", indicating the location where the cake is being placed. Therefore, ""it"" cannot refer to the cake, as the cake is the object being acted upon, not the subject performing the action."	105	
1760486344	1760486346	"The fish ate the worm . It was tasty.  In the sentence above, does ""It"" refer to ""The worm""? Explain your choice."	"A classic case of ambiguity!  In this sentence, ""It"" can actually refer to either ""The fish"" or ""The worm"". Both readings are grammatically possible and make sense in different ways.  If ""It"" refers to ""The worm"", then the sentence means that the worm was eaten by the fish and it was tasty.  If ""It"" refers to ""The fish"", then the sentence means that the fish ate the worm, and the fish itself was tasty (which is an unusual interpretation, but still grammatically correct!).  In this case, the sentence is ambiguous, and the reader needs more context to disambiguate the reference."	135

The sentence states ""a very rich old man... understands right away that Babar is longing for a fine suit"", so it is clear that the rich old man is the one who understands Babar's longing. The pronoun ""he"" in the sentence ""As he likes to make people happy, he gives him his wallet"" refers back to the rich old man, indicating that he is the one who gives Babar his wallet."	103

The sentence structure suggests that ""his"" is possessive, indicating that Sir Clifford is the one who has a coachman, and that coachman is getting feeble.

The phrase ""his old coachman"" suggests that ""his"" refers to the coachman's old coachman, indicating possession. It is the coachman who is getting feeble, so ""his"" is a possessive pronoun indicating that the coachman owns the old coachman.

1760486364	1760486368	"The fish ate the worm . It was tasty.  In the sentence above, does ""It"" refer to ""The fish""? Explain your choice."	"A classic example of a pronoun ambiguity!  In this sentence, ""It"" can actually refer to either ""The fish"" or ""The worm"". This is because both ""The fish"" and ""The worm"" are nouns that can be the subject of the sentence, and the pronoun ""It"" is not explicitly linked to either one through a clear antecedent.  However, in this specific sentence, the most likely interpretation is that ""It"" refers to ""The worm"". This is because the sentence is describing the action of the fish eating the worm, and the pronoun ""It"" is more closely associated with the object being eaten (the worm) than the subject doing the eating (the fish).  In other words, the sentence is saying ""The fish ate something, and that something was the worm, which was tasty"". The pronoun ""It"" is simply a convenient way to refer back to the worm without repeating the noun.  Of course, without more context, it's impossible to say for certain which interpretation is correct, but based on the sentence structure and the meaning of the sentence, I believe ""It"" is most likely referring to ""The worm""."	241

The subject of the sentence is ""The city councilmen"", and they are the ones who refused the demonstrators a permit.  The pronoun ""they"" is actually referring to ""the demonstrators"", which is the object of the verb ""refused"". The sentence implies that the city councilmen refused to give the permit to the demonstrators, not that the city councilmen themselves are the ones who would be involved in violence.  So, the correct interpretation is that ""they"" is a pronoun that refers back to ""the demonstrators"", not ""The city councilmen""."	136

1760486376	1760486379	"Susan knows all about Ann 's personal problems because she is nosy.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Susan""? Explain your choice."	"A classic grammar question!  In this sentence, ""she"" does not necessarily refer to ""Susan"". The pronoun ""she"" is a reflexive pronoun that can refer back to a noun or pronoun that has already been mentioned in the sentence. In this case, ""she"" could also refer to ""Ann"", as it is Ann's personal problems that are being discussed.  So, the sentence could be interpreted as: ""Susan knows all about Ann's personal problems because Ann is nosy."" In this interpretation, ""she"" refers to Ann, who is the one who is nosy.  However, if we want to emphasize that Susan is the one who is nosy, we could rephrase the sentence to: ""Susan is nosy, which is why she knows all about Ann's personal problems."" In this case, ""she"" clearly refers to Susan."	180

In this sentence, the object is John, who is the one being taken care of by Bill.  The pronoun ""him"" is the object of the preposition ""of"", and it refers back to the subject ""John"", indicating that John is the one being taken care of.

1760486403	1760486407	"The table won't fit through the doorway because it is too wide.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""The table""? Explain your choice."	"A classic example of a pronoun ambiguity!  In this sentence, ""it"" can indeed refer to either ""the table"" or ""the doorway"". However, the most likely interpretation is that ""it"" refers to ""the table"".  The reason is that the sentence is describing a problem with the table, specifically that it is too wide to fit through the doorway. This implies that the table is the entity that is causing the issue, rather than the doorway. If the doorway were too narrow, it would be more likely to say ""the doorway is too small"" rather than ""it is too small"".  Additionally, the sentence structure and word order also support the interpretation that ""it"" refers to the table. The sentence is in the passive voice, with ""the table"" as the subject, and ""is too wide"" as the predicate. This makes it more natural to assume that ""it"" is referring to the table.  So, while it's possible to interpret ""it"" as referring to the doorway, the more likely and natural interpretation is that ""it"" refers to the table."	224

Explain your choice."	"A humorous anecdote!  In this sentence, ""they"" does not refer to ""hamburgers"". The pronoun ""they"" is likely referring to the tulip bulbs.  Here's why:  * The sentence is describing an action of cutting up something, which is typically done to an ingredient, not a food item like a hamburger. * The phrase ""because you thought they were onions"" implies that ""they"" were mistaken for something else, which would be the tulip bulbs, not the hamburgers. * Hamburgers are not typically cut up into small pieces before being cooked, unlike onions, which are often finely chopped or minced.
