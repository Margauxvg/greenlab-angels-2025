1760622668	1760622670	Passage: Persian language -- Persian (/ˈpɜːrʒən, -ʃən/), also known by its endonym Farsi (فارسی fārsi (fɒːɾˈsiː) ( listen)), is one of the Western Iranian languages within the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family. It is primarily spoken in Iran, Afghanistan (officially known as Dari since 1958), and Tajikistan (officially known as Tajiki since the Soviet era), and some other regions which historically were Persianate societies and considered part of Greater Iran. It is written in the Persian alphabet, a modified variant of the Arabic script, which itself evolved from the Aramaic alphabet.  Question: do iran and afghanistan speak the same language  Explain your choice.	Yes, Iran and Afghanistan speak the same language, but with some variations.   The passage states that Persian (also known as Farsi) is primarily spoken in Iran, and also in Afghanistan (officially known as Dari since 1958). The key point is that while the language is the same, Afghanistan has officially renamed it to Dari, suggesting a slight difference in dialect or regional variation. However, the language itself is the same, and both countries share a common linguistic heritage.	100	1.0
1760622670	1760622672	Passage: Good Samaritan law -- Good Samaritan laws offer legal protection to people who give reasonable assistance to those who are, or who they believe to be, injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. The protection is intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, for fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. An example of such a law in common-law areas of Canada: a good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing. Its purpose is to keep people from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in treatment. By contrast, a duty to rescue law requires people to offer assistance and holds those who fail to do so liable.  Question: do good samaritan laws protect those who help at an accident  Explain your choice.	Yes, good Samaritan laws protect those who help at an accident.   This is because good Samaritan laws provide legal protection to individuals who give reasonable assistance to those who are injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. The laws are intended to prevent people from being hesitant to help others in need due to fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death.   In the context of an accident, if someone provides reasonable assistance to someone who has been injured, they are likely to be protected under good Samaritan laws. This means that if they make a mistake while trying to help, they are unlikely to be held liable for any unintended consequences.	136	
1760622672	1760622673	Passage: Windows Movie Maker -- Windows Movie Maker (formerly known as Windows Live Movie Maker in Windows 7) is a discontinued video editing software by Microsoft. It is a part of Windows Essentials software suite and offers the ability to create and edit videos as well as to publish them on OneDrive, Facebook, Vimeo, YouTube, and Flickr.  Question: is windows movie maker part of windows essentials  Explain your choice.	"Yes, Windows Movie Maker is part of Windows Essentials.

1760622673	1760622675	Passage: Powdered sugar -- Powdered sugar, also called confectioners' sugar, icing sugar, and icing cake, is a finely ground sugar produced by milling granulated sugar into a powdered state. It usually contains a small amount of anti-caking agent to prevent clumping and improve flow. Although most often produced in a factory, powdered sugar can also be made by processing ordinary granulated sugar in a coffee grinder, or by crushing it by hand in a mortar and pestle.  Question: is confectionary sugar the same as powdered sugar  Explain your choice.	Confectioners' sugar and powdered sugar are often used interchangeably and refer to the same type of sugar. They both describe a finely ground sugar produced by milling granulated sugar into a powdered state.   The terms 'confectioners' sugar' and 'powdered sugar' are regional or industry-specific terms that can be used interchangeably, with 'confectioners' sugar' more commonly used in North America and 'powdered sugar' in the UK and other parts of the world.	102	
1760622675	1760622680	Passage: The Elder Scrolls Online -- As with other games in The Elder Scrolls series, the game is set on the continent of Tamriel. The events of the game occur a millennium before those of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and around 800 years before The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. It has a broadly similar structure to Skyrim, with two separate conflicts progressing at the same time, one with the fate of the world in the balance, and one where the prize is supreme power on Tamriel. In The Elder Scrolls Online, the first struggle is against the Daedric Prince Molag Bal, who is attempting to meld the plane of Mundus with his realm of Coldharbour, and the second is to capture the vacant imperial throne, contested by three alliances of the mortal races. The player character has been sacrificed to Molag Bal, and Molag Bal has stolen their soul, the recovery of which is the primary game objective.  Question: is elder scrolls online the same as skyrim  Explain your choice.	No, The Elder Scrolls Online is not the same as Skyrim. While both games are part of the Elder Scrolls series, they are distinct games with different settings, storylines, and gameplay mechanics.  Here are some key differences:  1. **Setting**: The Elder Scrolls Online is set in the continent of Tamriel, but a thousand years before the events of Skyrim. This means that the geography, cultures, and politics of Tamriel are different in ESO compared to Skyrim. 2. **Storyline**: The main conflict in ESO involves the Daedric Prince Molag Bal and the invasion of Tamriel, whereas Skyrim's main conflict is against the return of the dragons and the civil war in the Imperial Province of Skyrim. 3. **Gameplay mechanics**: While both games have open-world exploration and character development, ESO has a more MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) focus, with a greater emphasis on player-versus-player (PvP) combat and a dynamic event system. Skyrim, on the other hand, is a single-player focused RPG with a more linear storyline and less emphasis on PvP. 4. **Protagonist**: In ESO, the player character has been sacrificed to Molag Bal and must recover their stolen soul, whereas in Skyrim, the player takes on the role of the Dragonborn, a hero tasked with saving Skyrim from the return of the dragons.  In summary, while both games are part of the Elder Scrolls series, they have distinct differences in setting, storyline, gameplay mechanics, and protagonist, making them separate experiences.	329	
1760622680	1760622681	Passage: Epsom railway station -- Epsom railway station serves the town of Epsom in Surrey. It is located off Waterloo Road and is less than two minutes' walk from the High Street. It is not in the London Oyster card zone unlike Epsom Downs or Tattenham Corner stations. The station building was replaced in 2012/2013 with a new building with apartments above the station (see end of article).  Question: can you use oyster card at epsom station  Explain your choice.	No, you cannot use an Oyster card at Epsom station. According to the passage, Epsom station is not in the London Oyster card zone.	35	
1760622681	1760622682	Passage: Da Vinci's Demons -- The series premiered in the United States on Starz on 12 April 2013, and its second season premiered on 22 March 2014. The series was renewed for a third season, which premiered on 24 October 2015. On 23 July 2015, Starz announced that the third season would be the show's last. However Goyer has left it open for a miniseries return.  Question: will there be a season 4 of da vinci's demons  Explain your choice.	No, there will not be a Season 4 of Da Vinci's Demons.   My choice is based on the information in the passage. The passage states that Starz announced on 23 July 2015 that the third season would be the show's last, indicating that the show was cancelled after the third season.	66	
1760622682	1760622683	Passage: Federal judiciary of the United States -- The federal courts are composed of three levels of courts. The Supreme Court of the United States is the court of last resort. It is generally an appellate court that operates under discretionary review, which means that the Court can choose which cases to hear, by granting writs of certiorari. There is therefore generally no basic right of appeal that extends automatically all the way to the Supreme Court. In a few situations (like lawsuits between state governments or some cases between the federal government and a state) it sits as a court of original jurisdiction.  Question: is the federal court the same as the supreme court  Explain your choice.	No, the federal court and the Supreme Court are not the same.   The passage explains that the federal courts are composed of three levels of courts, and the Supreme Court is one of them. This implies that the federal courts are a broader category that includes multiple levels of courts, while the Supreme Court is a specific one of those levels.	69	
1760622683	1760622684	Passage: Bixby letter -- In the 1998 war film Saving Private Ryan, General George Marshall (played by Harve Presnell) reads the Bixby letter to his officers before giving the order to find and send home Private James Francis Ryan after Ryan's three brothers died in battle.  Question: did abraham lincoln write the letter in saving private ryan  Explain your choice.	No, Abraham Lincoln did not write the letter in Saving Private Ryan.   The Bixby letter was written by President Abraham Lincoln, but it was written in 1864, during the American Civil War. The film Saving Private Ryan is set in 1944, during World War II, and is based on a true story.	68	
1760622684	1760622686	Passage: Batman & Robin (film) -- With the box office success of Batman Forever in June 1995, Warner Bros. immediately commissioned a sequel. They hired director Joel Schumacher and writer Akiva Goldsman to reprise their duties the following August, and decided it was best to fast track production for a June 1997 target release date, which is a break from the usual 3-year gap between films. Schumacher wanted to homage both the broad camp style of the 1960s television series and the work of Dick Sprang. The storyline of Batman & Robin was conceived by Schumacher and Goldsman during pre-production on A Time to Kill. Portions of Mr. Freeze's back-story were based on the Batman: The Animated Series episode ``Heart of Ice'', written by Paul Dini.  Question: is batman and robin a sequel to batman forever  Explain your choice.	"Yes, Batman and Robin is a sequel to Batman Forever.  The passage states that ""With the box office success of Batman Forever in June 1995, Warner Bros. immediately commissioned a sequel."" This implies that the events of Batman and Robin are directly connected to the events of Batman Forever, and that the success of the latter film prompted the production of the former."	75	
1760622686	1760622687	Passage: Badger -- Badgers are short-legged omnivores in the family Mustelidae, which also includes the otters, polecats, weasels, and wolverines. They belong to the caniform suborder of carnivoran mammals. The 11 species of badgers are grouped in three subfamilies: Melinae (Eurasian badgers), Mellivorinae (the honey badger or ratel), and Taxideinae (the American badger). The Asiatic stink badgers of the genus Mydaus were formerly included within Melinae (and thus Mustelidae), but recent genetic evidence indicates these are actually members of the skunk family, placing them in the taxonomic family Mephitidae.  Question: is a wolverine the same as a badger  Explain your choice.	No, a wolverine is not the same as a badger.   The passage states that wolverines are part of the family Mustelidae, which includes badgers, but they are not the same species. Instead, they are mentioned as one of the other members of the family Mustelidae, along with otters, polecats, weasels, and badgers. This indicates that while wolverines and badgers belong to the same family, they are distinct species within that family.	105	
1760622687	1760622688	Passage: Green Lantern (film) -- Green Lantern was released on June 17, 2011, and received generally negative reviews; most criticized the film for its screenplay, inconsistent tone, choice and portrayal of villains, and its use of CGI, while some praised Reynolds' performance. Reynolds would later voice his dissatisfaction with the film. The film underperformed at the box office, grossing $219 million against a production budget of $200 million. Due to the film's negative reception and disappointing box office performance, Warner Bros. canceled any plans for a sequel, instead opting to reboot the character in the DC Extended Universe line with the film Green Lantern Corps, set for release in 2020.  Question: will there be a green lantern 2 movie  Explain your choice.	No, there will not be a Green Lantern 2 movie.   The reason for this is that the first Green Lantern film (2011) underperformed at the box office and received negative reviews. Due to this, Warner Bros. canceled plans for a sequel.	55	
1760622688	1760622690	Passage: United States and the International Criminal Court -- The United States should have the chance to observe and assess the functioning of the court, over time, before choosing to become subject to its jurisdiction. Given these concerns, I will not, and do not recommend that my successor, submit the treaty to the Senate for advice and consent until our fundamental concerns are satisfied.  Question: does the icc has jurisdiction in the united states  Explain your choice.	Based on the given passage, the answer is: No, the ICC does not have jurisdiction in the United States.  The passage mentions that the author does not recommend submitting the treaty to the Senate for advice and consent until the fundamental concerns are satisfied, implying that the United States has not ratified the treaty that would grant the ICC jurisdiction over its citizens. This suggests that the United States has not formally agreed to be subject to the ICC's jurisdiction.	90	
1760622690	1760622693	Passage: Calcium carbide -- Calcium carbide is a chemical compound with the chemical formula of CaC. Its main use industrially is in the production of acetylene and calcium cyanamide.  Question: calcium carbide cac2 is the raw material for the production of acetylene  Explain your choice.	Based on the information provided, I would say that your answer is incorrect.  The passage states that calcium carbide has the chemical formula of CaC, not CaC2. This suggests that the correct chemical formula for calcium carbide is CaC, not CaC2.  However, the passage does mention that calcium carbide is used in the production of acetylene. To produce acetylene, calcium carbide is typically reacted with water, and the resulting reaction produces acetylene gas. The correct reaction is:  CaC + 2H2O -> Ca(OH)2 + C2H2  This reaction involves calcium carbide (CaC) reacting with water to produce acetylene gas (C2H2), which is the desired product.	160	
1760622693	1760622694	Passage: Now You See Me (film series) -- Now You See Me is a series of heist thriller film written by Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin, and Edward Ricourt. They focus on the actions of a team of illusionists named ``The Four Horsemen'' who pull off near impossible heists. The series features an ensemble cast including Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Michael Caine, Lizzy Caplan, and Morgan Freeman. The first film was released in 2013, while the second was released in 2016, and a third film is currently in development and set to be released in 2019. The series has received mixed reviews from critics and audiences and grossed nearly $700 million worldwide.  Question: is there a now you see me 3 coming out  Explain your choice.	"There is no official release of Now You See Me 3. However, a third film was initially announced to be released in 2019, but it seems this information is outdated.  The correct information is that a third film, titled ""Now You See Me 3"", is in development, but it is unclear if it will be released in 2024 or later."	77	
1760622694	1760622695	Passage: Penalty shoot-out (association football) -- A shoot-out is usually considered for statistical purposes to be separate from the match which preceded it. In the case of a two-legged fixture, the two matches are still considered either as two draws or as one win and one loss; in the case of a single match, it is still considered as a draw. This contrasts with a fixture won in extra time, where the score at the end of normal time is superseded. Converted shoot-out penalties are not considered as goals scored by a player for the purposes of their individual records, or for ``golden boot'' competitions.  Question: does a penalty shoot out goal count towards the golden boot  Explain your choice.	"No, a penalty shoot-out goal does not count towards the golden boot.   The passage states that ""Converted shoot-out penalties are not considered as goals scored by a player for the purposes of their individual records, or for ""golden boot"" competitions."" This directly answers the question, indicating that shoot-out goals are not included in the calculation of the golden boot."	73	
1760622695	1760622697	Passage: Cutthroat Kitchen -- Cutthroat Kitchen is a cooking show hosted by Alton Brown that aired on the Food Network from August 11, 2013 to July 19, 2017. It features four chefs competing in a three-round elimination cooking competition. The contestants face auctions in which they can purchase opportunities to sabotage one another. Each chef is given $25,000 at the start of the show; the person left standing keeps whatever money they have not spent in the auctions. The show ended on its fifteenth season in July 2017. The series shares some basic elements with other four-chef, three-round elimination-style competitions on Food Network including Chopped and Guy's Grocery Games. Numerous Cutthroat Kitchen contestants have competed on these shows.  Question: will there be a new season of cutthroat kitchen  Explain your choice.	Based on the provided information, it appears that the last season of Cutthroat Kitchen aired in July 2017, which is about 6 years ago. Since then, there has been no mention of a new season of the show.  Although it's not impossible that the show could be revived, there is no information to suggest that a new season is in production or planning. The Food Network has not made any official announcements about a new season of Cutthroat Kitchen, and the show has been off the air for a significant amount of time.  Considering these factors, it's unlikely that there will be a new season of Cutthroat Kitchen.	130

1760622698	1760622699	Passage: Half-elven -- In J.R.R. Tolkien's fictional universe of Middle-earth, the Half-elven (Sindarin singular Peredhel, plural Peredhil, Quenya singular Perelda) are the children of the union of Elves and Men. Of these, the most significant were the products of couplings between the Eldar (the Elves who followed the Call to Valinor) and the Edain (the Men of the Three Houses of early Men who allied themselves with the Eldar in their war against Morgoth).  Question: can elves and humans mate lord of the rings  Explain your choice.	Yes, according to the passage, elves and humans can mate in J.R.R. Tolkien's fictional universe of Middle-earth. The passage states that the Half-elven are the children of the union of Elves and Men.	45	
1760622699	1760622701	Passage: The Boy in the Plastic Bubble -- The Boy in the Plastic Bubble is a 1976 American made-for-television drama film inspired by the lives of David Vetter and Ted DeVita, who lacked effective immune systems. It stars John Travolta, Glynnis O'Connor, Diana Hyland, Robert Reed, Ralph Bellamy & P.J. Soles. It was written by Douglas Day Stewart, executive produced by Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg (who, at the time, produced Starsky and Hutch and Charlie's Angels), and directed by Randal Kleiser, who would work with Travolta again in Grease shortly after. The original music score was composed by Mark Snow. The theme song ``What Would They Say'' was written and sung by Paul Williams. William Howard Taft High School in Woodland Hills was used for filming.  Question: the boy in the plastic bubble based on true story  Explain your choice.	"The answer is: Yes, ""The Boy in the Plastic Bubble"" is based on a true story.  The passage mentions that the film is ""inspired by the lives of David Vetter and Ted DeVita, who lacked effective immune systems."" This suggests that the film is based on the real-life experiences of these individuals, who were likely isolated in a ""plastic bubble"" to protect them from infection due to their weakened immune systems."	90	
1760622701	1760622703	Passage: A priori and a posteriori -- These terms are used with respect to reasoning (epistemology) to distinguish ``necessary conclusions from first premises'' (i.e., what must come before sense observation) from ``conclusions based on sense observation'' (which must follow it). Thus, the two kinds of knowledge, justification, or argument, may be glossed:  Question: science begins with the premise that knowledge should first be acquired through observation  Explain your choice.	"The passage states that ""conclusions based on sense observation"" are a posteriori.   This means that these conclusions are derived from or based on sensory experience or observation.   In this context, the passage suggests that the premise that knowledge should first be acquired through observation is a posteriori. This is because this premise is based on the idea that our understanding of the world is primarily derived from sensory experience and observation.  Therefore, the correct answer is that science begins with the premise that knowledge should first be acquired through observation, which is a posteriori."	112	
1760622703	1760622703	Passage: Tim Brown (American football) -- Timothy Donell Brown (born July 22, 1966) is a former American football wide receiver who played professionally in the National Football League (NFL).

Thus general consumption is accepted. Several cafes have outdoor serving in the same zones.  Question: can you drink alcohol in public in denmark  Explain your choice.	Yes, you can drink alcohol in public in Denmark.   This is because the law in Denmark allows general consumption of alcohol in public as long as it doesn't disturb the public law and order.	40	
1760622704	1760622705	Passage: Jersey pound -- Both Jersey and Bank of England notes are legal tender in Jersey and circulate together, alongside the Guernsey pound and Scottish banknotes. The Jersey notes are not legal tender in the United Kingdom but are legal currency, so creditors and traders may accept them if they so choose.  Question: is jersey currency legal tender in the uk  Explain your choice.	"No, Jersey currency is not legal tender in the UK.   According to the passage, Jersey notes are ""not legal tender in the United Kingdom"" but are ""legal currency"". This means that they are a valid form of currency, but creditors and traders are not obligated to accept them, and their use is at the discretion of the individual."	70

The passage states that the manga provides a ""fictionalized account of the Warring States period."" This implies that while the setting and historical context of the story are based on actual events, the specific characters and plot are not based on real people or events. The story is a work of fiction, created by the author Yasuhisa Hara."	83	
1760622709	1760622711	Passage: European Economic Area -- As of 2014 the contracting parties to the EEA are 3 of the 4 EFTA member states and 27 of the 28 EU member states. The 28th and newest EU member, Croatia, finished negotiating their accession to the EEA in November 2013, and since 12 April 2014 is provisionally applying the agreement pending its ratification by all EEA member states.

1760622711	1760622715	Passage: Saline (medicine) -- Saline, also known as saline solution, is a mixture of sodium chloride in water and has a number of uses in medicine. Applied to the affected area it is used to clean wounds, help remove contact lenses, and help with dry eyes. By injection into a vein it is used to treat dehydration such as from gastroenteritis and diabetic ketoacidosis. It is also used to dilute other medications to be given by injection.  Question: is saline and sodium chloride the same thing  Explain your choice.	No, saline and sodium chloride are not the same thing, although they are closely related.  Sodium chloride is a chemical compound composed of sodium and chlorine, with the chemical formula NaCl. It is a white crystalline solid that is highly soluble in water. In its pure form, sodium chloride is not a solution, but rather a solid substance.  Saline solution, on the other hand, is a mixture of sodium chloride dissolved in water. It is a solution, not a solid, and its concentration can vary depending on the specific formulation. Saline solutions can range from 0.45% to 0.9% sodium chloride concentration, with 0.9% being the most common concentration.  In medical contexts, saline solutions are often used as a vehicle for delivering medications, as a wound cleanser, or as an intravenous fluid for hydration. In these applications, the sodium chloride is dissolved in water to create a solution that can be easily administered or applied to the body.  So, while sodium chloride is a component of saline solution, the two terms are not interchangeable. Sodium chloride refers to the solid chemical compound, while saline solution refers to the mixture of sodium chloride in water.	244

1760622716	1760622717	Passage: Joyce Summers -- The premise of the series is that Buffy is the latest Slayer, a young woman endowed by mystical forces with superhuman powers to fight and defeat vampires, demons, and other evil forces in the fictional town of Sunnydale. Like every Slayer before her, she was chosen and informed of her destiny when she was 15 years old. Her mother is unaware of her daughter's powers and responsibilities until Buffy is forced to tell her at the end of the second season of the television series. Although Joyce is shocked at this revelation, she recovers quickly and remains a source of stability for Buffy and Buffy's small circle of friends who assist her, dubbed the Scooby Gang. Eventually Joyce is able to take Buffy's dangerous demon-fighting in stride and even become proud and respectful of her daughter's abilities. Her natural death from an illness in the fifth season forces Buffy to face becoming an adult.  Question: does buffy's mom know she's a slayer  Explain your choice.	No, Buffy's mom, Joyce, does not know she is a Slayer initially. She finds out at the end of the second season.	29	
1760622717	1760622718	Passage: Leaning Tower of Pisa -- The tower's tilt began during construction in the 12th century, caused by an inadequate foundation on ground too soft on one side to properly support the structure's weight. The tilt increased in the decades before the structure was completed in the 14th century. It gradually increased until the structure was stabilized (and the tilt partially corrected) by efforts in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.  Question: was the leaning tower of pisa built leaning  Explain your choice.	No, the Leaning Tower of Pisa was not built leaning. The tower's tilt began during construction in the 12th century due to an inadequate foundation on ground that was too soft on one side to properly support the structure's weight. The tilt increased over time as the structure was completed in the 14th century.	67	
1760622718	1760622720	Passage: Fool's Gold (2008 film) -- Fool's Gold is a 2008 American adventure-romance film from Warner Bros. Pictures about a recently divorced couple who rekindle their romantic life while searching for a lost treasure. The film was directed by Andy Tennant and reunites the How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days stars Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson.  Question: is the movie fool's gold a true story  Explain your choice.	"No, the movie ""Fool's Gold"" is not a true story. It is a work of fiction, an adventure-romance film created by writers based on their imagination. The plot involves a fictional treasure hunt and a rekindled romance between the two main characters, played by Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson.  There is no historical or real-life basis for the story, and the events depicted in the movie are not based on actual events. The film is a product of Hollywood storytelling, intended to entertain and engage the audience, rather than a factual retelling of real-life events."	123	
1760622720	1760622721	Passage: Super Bowl curse -- The home field curse affects the host team of the Super Bowl. So far no team has yet managed to reach the Super Bowl in their home stadium. Four teams with Super Bowls in their home venue have qualified for the divisional playoffs: the 1994 Miami Dolphins, the 1998 Miami Dolphins, the 2016 Houston Texans, and the 2017 Minnesota Vikings, the Vikings being the first to qualify for their conference's title game. From 1966--2011 (excluding the six Super Bowl games held in a stadium without a professional team), the Super Bowl host team has had 11 winning seasons, four split seasons, and 25 losing seasons. Mathematically, the probability of that many losing seasons or more occurring by chance (assuming a 50 percent chance of having a losing season (disregarding .500 seasons)) is 7.69 percent. It should be noted, however, that the Super Bowl host stadium is selected several years before the game is played, without regard to the teams that qualify.  Question: has any nfl team played the superbowl at home  Explain your choice.	"No, no team has played the Super Bowl at home. The passage mentions that ""so far no team has yet managed to reach the Super Bowl in their home stadium."" This statement is made in the context of discussing the ""home field curse"" affecting the host team of the Super Bowl."	59	
1760622721	1760622721	Passage: State constitution (Australia) -- In Australia, each state has its own constitution. Each state constitution preceded the Constitution of Australia as constitutions of the then separate British colonies, but all the states ceded powers to the Parliament of Australia as part of federation in 1901.  Question: does each australian state have its own constitution  Explain your choice.	"Yes, each Australian state has its own constitution.   This is stated in the passage, ""In Australia, each state has its own constitution."""	30	1.0
1760622721	1760622726	Passage: Bundle branch block -- A bundle branch block can be diagnosed when the duration of the QRS complex on the ECG exceeds 120 ms. A right bundle branch block typically causes prolongation of the last part of the QRS complex, and may shift the heart's electrical axis slightly to the right. The ECG will show a terminal R wave in lead V1 and a slurred S wave in lead I. Left bundle branch block widens the entire QRS, and in most cases shifts the heart's electrical axis to the left. The ECG will show a QS or rS complex in lead V1 and a monophasic R wave in lead I. Another normal finding with bundle branch block is appropriate T wave discordance. In other words, the T wave will be deflected opposite the terminal deflection of the QRS complex. Bundle branch block, especially left bundle branch block, can lead to cardiac dyssynchrony. The simultaneous occurrence of left and right bundle branch block leads to total AV block.  Question: can you have a right and left bundle branch block  Explain your choice.	Yes, it is possible to have a right and left bundle branch block (RBBB and LBBB) at the same time. This condition is known as bifascicular block or left and right bundle branch block (LBBB + RBBB) or more specifically, left anterior and right bundle branch block (LAD and RBBB).  In this condition, the bundle branches are blocked on both sides, which can lead to a more severe form of heart block, often referred to as a bifascicular block. This can further increase the risk of complete heart block (third-degree AV block) and cardiac dyssynchrony, as both bundle branches are affected.  The ECG findings in this condition would be a combination of the characteristics mentioned in the passage for both RBBB and LBBB, such as:  - Terminal R wave in lead V1 and a slurred S wave in lead I (RBBB) - QS or rS complex in lead V1 and a monophasic R wave in lead I (LBBB)  The presence of both RBBB and LBBB would indicate a more complex conduction abnormality in the heart, and patients with this condition may require closer monitoring and potentially further treatment to manage the risk of cardiac complications.	266	
1760622726	1760622728	Passage: Check (chess) -- In informal games, it is customary to announce ``check'' when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check. In formal competitions, however, check is rarely announced.  Question: do you always have to say check in chess  Explain your choice.	"No, you do not always have to say ""check"" in chess.   In informal games, it is customary to announce ""check"" when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check. This is a social convention to inform the opponent of the situation and to maintain good sportsmanship. However, in formal competitions, such as tournaments or official games, announcing ""check"" is not required and is generally considered unnecessary."	87	
1760622728	1760622729	Passage: Australian Cattle Dog -- The Texas Heeler is a cross between the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Shepherd that was first registered with the Animal Research Foundation (ARF) in 1970. The ARF has registered Australian Cattle Dogs without papers as ``Australian Cattledog Queensland Heelers'' since 1965 and was the first organisation to recognise the Australian Shepherd. Although originally bred for its ability to work cattle, the Texas Heeler is increasingly used as a pet and a companion in dog sports. As with most cross breeds, the Texas Heeler's size and appearance is a variable combination of the parent breeds.  Question: is an australian shepherd the same as an australian cattle dog  Explain your choice.	"No, an Australian Shepherd and an Australian Cattle Dog are not the same.   Although the passage mentions the ""Texas Heeler"" as a cross between the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Shepherd, it does not indicate that the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Shepherd are the same breed. In fact, the passage mentions that the ARF (Animal Research Foundation) was the first organisation to recognise the Australian Shepherd, implying that they are distinct breeds."	93	
1760622729	1760622730	Passage: Tomato purée -- Tomato purée is a thick liquid made by cooking and straining tomatoes. The difference between tomato paste, tomato purée, and tomato sauce is consistency; tomato puree has a thicker consistency and a deeper flavour than sauce.  Question: is tomato puree and tomato sauce the same thing  Explain your choice.	No, tomato purée and tomato sauce are not the same thing.   According to the passage, the key difference between them is the consistency. Tomato purée has a thicker consistency than tomato sauce. Additionally, the passage states that tomato purée has a deeper flavor than tomato sauce.	58	
1760622730	1760622732	Passage: The Blues Brothers -- The Blues Brothers are an American blues and soul revivalist band which was founded in 1978 by comedy actors Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi as part of a musical sketch on Saturday Night Live. Belushi and Aykroyd fronted the band, respectively in character as lead vocalist ``Joliet'' Jake Blues and harmonica player/vocalist Elwood Blues. The band was composed of well-known and respected musicians, and debuted as the musical guest on the April 22, 1978, episode of Saturday Night Live, opening the show performing ``Hey Bartender'', and later ``Soul Man''.  Question: is the blues brothers based on a true story  Explain your choice.	"No, The Blues Brothers are not based on a true story. They are a fictional band created for a musical sketch on Saturday Night Live. The characters ""Joliet"" Jake Blues and Elwood Blues were portrayed by comedy actors Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi, who were part of the show's cast. The band was created as a fictional entity to entertain the audience, not based on real-life events or individuals."	88	
1760622732	1760622733	Passage: Newcastle upon Tyne -- Newcastle upon Tyne (locally /njuːˈkæsəl/ ( listen)), commonly known as Newcastle, is a city in Tyne and Wear, North East England, 103 miles (166 km) south of Edinburgh and 277 miles (446 km) north of London on the northern bank of the River Tyne, 8.5 mi (13.7 km) from the North Sea. Newcastle is the most populous city in the North East, and forms the core of the Tyneside conurbation, the eighth most populous urban area in the United Kingdom. Newcastle is a member of the English Core Cities Group and is a member of the Eurocities network of European cities.  Question: is newcastle upon tyne the same as newcastle  Explain your choice.	"Yes, Newcastle upon Tyne is the same as Newcastle.   The passage states that ""Newcastle upon Tyne (locally /njuːˈkæsəl/ (listen)), commonly known as Newcastle"" which indicates that Newcastle upon Tyne is the full name of the city, and Newcastle is a nickname or a more commonly used informal name."	76	
1760622733	1760622738	Passage: Post Office Ltd -- The Post Office provides information on services and accepts postal items and payment on behalf of the two collection and delivery divisions of Royal Mail Group, Royal Mail and Parcelforce. These include a variety of ordinary and guaranteed services both for delivery within the United Kingdom and to international destinations. Postage stamps (including commemorative stamps and other philatelic items) are sold, while applications for redirection of mail are accepted on behalf of Royal Mail.  Question: is post office and royal mail the same  Explain your choice.	No, Post Office and Royal Mail are not the same, although they are closely related.   The Post Office is a separate entity that provides services and accepts payments on behalf of Royal Mail Group, which includes two divisions: Royal Mail and Parcelforce. Royal Mail is the actual postal service provider, and the Post Office is a retail partner that offers their services.  Think of it like a convenience store and a bank. A convenience store may sell products from various brands, such as Coca-Cola or Pepsi, but the store itself is not the manufacturer of those products. Similarly, the Post Office sells Royal Mail's services, but it is not the postal service provider itself.  The key differences between the Post Office and Royal Mail are:  1. **Ownership**: The Post Office is a separate company, while Royal Mail is a division of the Royal Mail Group. 2. **Services**: The Post Office offers a range of services, including postal services, bill payments, and other retail services, while Royal Mail is primarily a postal service provider. 3. **Business model**: The Post Office acts as a retail partner, selling Royal Mail's services to customers, while Royal Mail is responsible for the actual delivery and collection of mail.  In summary, while the Post Office and Royal Mail are connected, they are not the same entity.	273	
1760622738	1760622738	Passage: Unsuccessful nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States -- Justices are nominated by the president and then confirmed by the U.S. Senate.

There have been 37 unsuccessful nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States. Of these, 11 nominees were rejected in Senate roll-call votes, 11 were withdrawn by the president, and 15 lapsed at the end of a session of Congress. Six of these unsuccessful nominees were subsequently nominated and confirmed to other seats on the Court. Additionally, although confirmed, seven nominees either declined office or (in one instance) died before assuming office.  Question: has any supreme court nominee not been confirmed  Explain your choice.	Yes, there have been 37 unsuccessful Supreme Court nominations in the United States.	17	
1760622738	1760622739	Passage: Thanksgiving (United States) -- Thanksgiving, or Thanksgiving Day, is a public holiday celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States. It originated as a harvest festival. Thanksgiving has been celebrated nationally on and off since 1789, after Congress requested a proclamation by George Washington. It has been celebrated as a federal holiday every year since 1863, when, during the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a national day of ``Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens,'' to be celebrated on the last Thursday in November. Together with Christmas and the New Year, Thanksgiving is a part of the broader fall/winter holiday season in the U.S.  Question: is thanksgiving always the last thursday of the month  Explain your choice.	No, Thanksgiving is not always the last Thursday of the month. According to the passage, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. This means it can be on the 22nd, 23rd, 24th, or 25th of November, but not necessarily the last day of the month.	65

The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.  Question: is lord of the rings after the hobbit  Explain your choice.	"Yes, ""The Lord of the Rings"" is after ""The Hobbit.""   The passage explicitly states that ""The Lord of the Rings"" began as a sequel to ""The Hobbit,"" which was written in 1937."	48	
1760622740	1760622743	Passage: Fallen (2016 film) -- In December 2014, it was announced that Torment, the second installment in the Fallen book series, was in development. It is unknown whether the last two novels, Passion and Rapture, and the spin-off novel, Unforgiven, will be adapted as well. In 2017, producer Kevan Van Thompson asked the fans if they want an adaptation of ``Torment'', showing that the sequel still could be made.  Question: is the fallen movie going to have a sequel  Explain your choice.	"According to the passage, it seems that there is a possibility of a sequel, but it is not confirmed. The passage mentions that the second installment, ""Torment"", is in development, and the producer, Kevan Van Thompson, asked fans about their interest in an adaptation of ""Torment"" in 2017.

1760622745	1760622751	Passage: The Lord of the Rings -- The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J.R.R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.  Question: is lord of the rings considered an epic  Explain your choice.	Yes, The Lord of the Rings is considered an epic.   My choice is based on the following reasons:  1. **Scope and scale**: The Lord of the Rings is a long and complex story that spans a vast geography, involving multiple continents, kingdoms, and cultures. The novel's narrative is set in Middle-earth, a detailed and richly imagined world created by Tolkien. The story encompasses a grand quest to destroy the One Ring, which requires the cooperation of various characters and factions.  2. **Heroic journey**: The novel follows the heroic journey of Frodo Baggins, a hobbit who embarks on a perilous quest to destroy the One Ring. This classic hero's journey narrative is a common trait of epic literature, where the protagonist faces challenges, undergoes transformation, and ultimately achieves a triumphant outcome.  3. **High stakes**: The fate of Middle-earth hangs in the balance, and the outcome of the quest has far-reaching consequences. This high-stakes narrative is typical of epic literature, where the fate of the world or a civilization is at risk.  4. **Epic themes**: The Lord of the Rings explores universal themes such as friendship, sacrifice, duty, and the struggle between good and evil. These themes are characteristic of epic literature, which often explores the human condition and the nature of existence.  5. **Genre classification**: The Lord of the Rings is commonly classified as a high fantasy novel, which is a subgenre of epic literature. High fantasy often features elaborate world-building, complex characters, and epic storylines, all of which are present in The Lord of the Rings.  In conclusion, based on its scope, heroic journey, high stakes, epic themes, and genre classification, The Lord of the Rings is indeed considered an epic novel.	371	
1760622751	1760622752	Passage: Euro sign -- The euro sign (€) is the currency sign used for the euro, the official currency of the Eurozone in the European Union (EU). The design was presented to the public by the European Commission on 12 December 1996. The international three-letter code (according to ISO standard ISO 4217) for the euro is EUR. In Unicode it is encoded at U+20AC € euro sign (HTML &#8364; &euro; ). In English, the sign precedes the value (for instance, €10, not 10 €, unlike most other European languages). In some style guides, but not others, the euro sign is unspaced.  Question: does the euro sign go before the number  Explain your choice.	"Yes, according to the passage, the euro sign goes before the number in English. The passage states, ""In English, the sign precedes the value (for instance, €10, not 10 €, unlike most other European languages)."""	50	
1760622752	1760622753	Passage: Induction cooking -- For nearly all models of induction cooktops, a cooking vessel must be made of, or contain, a ferrous metal such as cast iron or some stainless steels. The iron in the pot concentrates the current to produce heat in the metal. If the metal is too thin, or does not provide enough resistance to current flow, heating will not be effective. Most induction tops will not heat copper or aluminum vessels because the magnetic field cannot produce a concentrated current; ``all metal'' induction tops use much higher frequencies to overcome that effect. Any vessel can be used if placed on a suitable metal disk which functions as a conventional hotplate.  Question: can stainless steel be used on induction cooktop  Explain your choice.	Yes, stainless steel can be used on an induction cooktop.   According to the passage, it states that a cooking vessel must be made of, or contain, a ferrous metal such as cast iron or some stainless steels. This indicates that stainless steel is a suitable material for use on an induction cooktop, as long as it is a ferrous metal, meaning it contains iron.	80	1.0
1760622753	1760622755	Passage: Dismissal (employment) -- ``Firing'' is a common colloquial term in the English language (particularly used in the U.S.) for termination. The term ``firing'' may have been initiated in the 1910s at the National Cash Register Company. Other terms for dismissal are being ``sacked'', ``canned'', ``let go'', ``ran-off'', ``axed'', ``given walking papers'', ``given the pink slip'' or ``boned''. Other terms, more often used in Commonwealth countries, include ``to get the boot'' and ``to get the sack''.  Question: is job termination the same as being fired  Explain your choice.	"Yes, job termination and being fired are essentially the same thing.   Termination refers to the act of ending an employment contract or agreement between an employee and an employer, which can be initiated by either party. Being fired, on the other hand, refers to the act of an employer terminating the employment contract, usually due to unsatisfactory performance, misconduct, or other reasons.  The terms are often used interchangeably, although ""termination"" might sound more formal and neutral, whereas ""fired"" has a stronger connotation, implying that the termination was initiated by the employer and may be involuntary for the employee."	125	
1760622755	1760622759	Passage: Inattentional blindness -- In a 2015 study, Cary Stothart, Walter Boot, and Daniel Simons attempted to replicate and extend the findings from both Graham and Burke's 2011 study and Steven Most and colleague's 2000 study on Amazon Mechanical Turk using a sample of 515 participants that varied in age. In this study, participants were tasked with counting the number of times a number of white moving objects crossed the vertical midpoint of a display while ignoring a number of black moving objects. The unexpected object in this case was a gray cross that moved horizontally across the display at various distances from the vertical midpoint (this was manipulated between participants). Overall, they found that inattentional blindness susceptibility increases with age, which replicates the finding from Graham and Burke. In fact, they found that every 10 years of age was associated with a 1.3 fold increase in the probability of displaying inattentional blindness. They also found that the probability of inattentional blindness increases as the distance between the observer's focus of attention and the unexpected object increases, which replicates the finding from Most and colleagues. However, they also found that the relationship that age has with inattentional blindness does not change as a function of the unexpected object's distance from the focus of attention, suggesting that useful field of view does not mediate the relationship between age and inattentional blindness.  Question: does age have any influence on attentional ability or inattentional blindness  Explain your choice.	Yes, age has an influence on attentional ability and inattentional blindness.  The passage explains that the study found that inattentional blindness susceptibility increases with age, which means that older individuals are more likely to be affected by inattentional blindness. This suggests that age has a negative impact on attentional ability, making it more difficult for older individuals to notice unexpected stimuli when their attention is focused on another task.  In particular, the study found that every 10 years of age is associated with a 1.3 fold increase in the probability of displaying inattentional blindness, indicating a strong correlation between age and susceptibility to inattentional blindness. This suggests that as people age, their attentional abilities decline, making them more prone to inattentional blindness.  Therefore, the answer to the question is that age does have an influence on attentional ability and inattentional blindness, with older individuals being more susceptible to inattentional blindness due to declining attentional abilities.	199	
1760622759	1760622760	Passage: Sanskrit -- Sanskrit belongs to the Indo-European family of languages. It is one of the three ancient documented languages that likely arose from a common root language now referred to as the Proto-Indo-European language:  Question: is sanskrit the first language of the world  Explain your choice.	No, Sanskrit is not the first language of the world. The passage actually indicates that Sanskrit belongs to the Indo-European family of languages, which implies it is a descendant of a more ancient language. The passage mentions that Sanskrit, along with two other ancient documented languages, likely arose from a common root language called Proto-Indo-European language.  This suggests that Proto-Indo-European is the more ancient language, and Sanskrit is one of its descendants, rather than being the first language of the world.	106	
1760622760	1760622761	Passage: Jack Russell Terrier -- The Jack Russell Terrier is a small terrier that has its origins in fox hunting. It is principally white-bodied and smooth, rough or broken-coated but can be any colour.  Question: is a jack russell considered a small breed  Explain your choice.	"Yes, a Jack Russell Terrier is considered a small breed.   My choice is based on the statement in the passage that says ""small terrier."" The term ""small"" is an adjective that describes the size of the Jack Russell Terrier."	51	
1760622761	1760622762	Passage: Air Force One -- The Air Force usually does not have fighter aircraft escort the presidential aircraft over the United States but it has occurred, for example during the attack on the World Trade Center.  Question: does air force one travel with fighter escort  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, the answer is: No, Air Force One does not usually have fighter aircraft escort the presidential aircraft over the United States.	30	
1760622762	1760622770	Passage: AR-15s in California -- The Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989 banned Colt AR-15 rifles by name in the State of California. California's 2000 Assault Weapons ban went further and banned AR-15s made by other manufacturers by name such as Bushmaster, PWA, and Olympic Arms.  Question: is it legal to own an ar15 in california  Explain your choice.	"Based on the information provided, it is not entirely clear whether it is legal to own an AR-15 in California. However, I can provide some context and additional information to help clarify the situation.  The Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989 banned certain firearms, including Colt AR-15 rifles, by name in California. This law was later expanded by California's 2000 Assault Weapons ban, which banned AR-15s made by other manufacturers, such as Bushmaster, PWA, and Olympic Arms.  However, it's essential to note that the law does not ban all AR-15s. The California Department of Justice (DOJ) has established a list of ""assault weapons"" that are banned in the state. To be considered an assault weapon, a firearm must meet certain criteria, such as having specific features like a folding stock, pistol grip, or flash suppressor.  To own an AR-15 in California, you would need to ensure that it does not meet the criteria for an assault weapon. Some possible ways to own an AR-15 in California include:  1.  **Pre-ban rifles**: If you own a pre-ban AR-15 rifle, such as one made before 1994, it may be grandfathered in and exempt from the ban. 2.  **Non-assault features**: If your AR-15 has been modified to remove features that make it an assault weapon, such as a folding stock or pistol grip, it may be considered a non-assault firearm. 3.  **Compliant rifles**: Some manufacturers produce AR-15s that are designed to comply with California's regulations. These rifles often have features such as fixed stocks, non-pistol grips, and no flash suppressors. 4.  **Handgun conversion kits**: You can also purchase a handgun conversion kit for your AR-15, which can be used to convert the rifle into a pistol, making it exempt from the assault weapon ban.  It is crucial to note that California's firearms laws are complex and subject to change.

1760622773	1760622775	Passage: Homologous chromosome -- A couple of homologous chromosomes, or homologs, are a set of one maternal and one paternal chromosome that pair up with each other inside a cell during meiosis. Homologs have the same genes in the same loci where they provide points along each chromosome which enable a pair of chromosomes to align correctly with each other before separating during meiosis. This is the basis for Mendelian inheritance which characterizes inheritance patterns of genetic material from an organism to its offspring parent developmental cell at the given time and area.  Question: do homologous chromosomes carry information for the same traits  Explain your choice.	"Yes, homologous chromosomes carry information for the same traits.   This is because they have the same genes in the same loci. The term ""homologous"" itself implies that these chromosomes are similar or equivalent in structure and function, particularly in terms of the genetic information they carry. This similarity allows them to pair up during meiosis and align correctly before separating, ensuring that each offspring receives a complete set of chromosomes with the same genes."	91	
1760622775	1760622776	Passage: Michigan Wolverines football -- Michigan began competing in intercollegiate football in 1879.

1760622776	1760622780	Passage: Waiter Rule -- The Waiter Rule refers to a common belief that one's true character can be gleaned from how one treats staff or service workers, such as a ``waiter''. The rule was one of William H Swanson's 33 Unwritten Rules of Management, copied from Dave Barry's version ``If someone is nice to you but rude to the waiter, they are not a nice person.''  Question: you can tell a lot about a person by how they treat their waiter  Explain your choice.	You can tell a lot about a person by how they treat their waiter because it reveals their character and values. When someone is nice to you but rude to the waiter, it suggests that they are not genuinely kind or respectful, but rather, they are trying to present a certain image or impression to you. This behavior indicates a lack of empathy and a tendency to prioritize their own needs over others.  On the other hand, someone who treats their waiter with kindness, respect, and gratitude is more likely to be a genuinely nice person. They demonstrate a sense of awareness and appreciation for the hard work and service provided by the waiter, and this behavior is often reflective of their broader character.  Treating a waiter well also shows that a person values fairness, respect, and human dignity, which are essential qualities of a good person. In contrast, being rude to a waiter can be a red flag, indicating that a person may be entitled, dismissive, or lacking in social skills.  Overall, how someone treats their waiter can be a revealing indicator of their character, values, and social norms, making it a useful insight into their personality.	230

The device, an orb he finds in the mantle above a fireplace in the Luthor mansion, leads Lex to the Fortress of Solitude, where he is confronted by Clark. Having finally discovered Clark's secret, Lex uses the orb to bring down the Fortress around Clark and himself.  Question: does lex luthor know who superman is in smallville  Explain your choice.

It is a nerve with a solely motor function. The nerve arises from the hypoglossal nucleus in the brain stem as a number of small rootlets, passes through the hypoglossal canal and down through the neck, and eventually passes up again over the tongue muscles it supplies into the tongue. There are two hypoglossal nerves in the body: one on the left, and one on the right.  Question: several cranial nerves innervate structures of the tongue  Explain your choice.	This statement is incorrect. The passage states that the hypoglossal nerve innervates all the extrinsic and intrinsic muscles of the tongue, except for the palatoglossus, which is innervated by the vagus nerve. This implies that there are at least two cranial nerves that innervate structures of the tongue: the hypoglossal nerve and the vagus nerve.	82
