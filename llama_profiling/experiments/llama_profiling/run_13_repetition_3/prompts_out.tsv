1760505338	1760505340	Premise: It was a complex language. Not written down but handed down. One might say it was peeled down.  Hypothesis: the language was peeled down  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states that the language was not written down but handed down, and also that it was peeled down. The word ""peeled"" is a verb that can be interpreted as ""stripped down"" or ""simplified.""   Since the language was not written down, it's possible that it was passed down orally. The idea that it was ""peeled down"" suggests that it was simplified or condensed in some way, which is consistent with the notion that it was passed down orally, as oral traditions often involve simplifying or condensing information for easier transmission.  Therefore, the premise provides a possible explanation for the hypothesis that the language was peeled down, and it's reasonable to conclude that the premise entails the hypothesis."	156
1760505340	1760505342	Premise: It is part of their religion, a religion I do not scoff at as it holds many elements which match our own even though it lacks the truth of ours. At one of their great festivals they have the ritual of driving out the devils from their bodies. First the drummers come on - I may say that no women are allowed to take part in this ritual and the ladies here will perhaps agree with me that they are fortunate in that omission.  Hypothesis: no women are allowed to take part in this ritual  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states ""no women are allowed to take part in this ritual"" directly, making it a statement of fact. This statement is a part of the description of the ritual, and it implies that this restriction is a part of their religion. The hypothesis, being a statement that no women are allowed to take part in the ritual, is a direct inference from the premise."	82
1760505342	1760505344	Premise: The Paris to Rouen railway was being extended to Le Havre, and the line cut straight through Dr Flaubert's land. Part of it was to be compulsorily purchased. You could say that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy.  Hypothesis: Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that the Paris to Rouen railway was extended to Le Havre, cutting through Dr. Flaubert's land, and that part of it was to be compulsorily purchased. This situation likely caused Dr. Flaubert significant stress and anxiety, which could have triggered or exacerbated his epilepsy. The premise implies that this stressful event led to Dr. Flaubert being ""shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset."" Therefore, the premise supports the hypothesis that his epilepsy was a factor in his retreat to Croisset."	118
1760505344	1760505346	Premise: Part of it was to be compulsorily purchased. You could say that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy. You could also say he was driven there by the railway.  Hypothesis: Gustave was driven to creative retreat in Croisset by the railway  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that part of it (presumably a house or a property) was to be compulsorily purchased, and two alternative reasons are given for Gustave being shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset: epilepsy and the railway.   The premise does not explicitly state that the railway was the reason Gustave was driven to Croisset, but rather mentions it as one of two possible reasons. The correct statement of the premise would be ""Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by either epilepsy or the railway."""	120
1760505346	1760505347	Premise: Some of them, like for instance the farm in Connecticut, are quite small. If I like a place I buy it. I guess you could say it's a hobby.  Hypothesis: buying places is a hobby  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that if you like a place, you buy it, which implies that buying places is a hobby, as it's something you do when you enjoy or like something (in this case, a place). The use of the phrase ""I guess you could say it's a hobby"" further reinforces the idea that buying places is indeed a hobby."	80
1760505347	1760505348	Premise: Look, my dear, I'm not in my dotage yet, and I know I'm a grumbler and a complainer. You could say the only form of comfort I 've got are my complaints.  Hypothesis: the only form of comfort he has are his complaints  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states that the speaker's only form of comfort is his complaints, and then it explicitly says ""You could say the only form of comfort I've got are my complaints."" This is a direct statement that supports the hypothesis, making it an entailment."	62
1760505348	1760505350	Premise: Then the silence in the Zoo became complete. Woil stared around him and then suddenly with a push of his wings raised himself into the air, turned, and landed ten feet away on the back of a green bench. Creggan could see that he was afraid and that his fear was making him terribly uncertain.  Hypothesis: Woil was afraid  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states that Woil ""was afraid"" and that his fear was making him ""terribly uncertain."" This indicates that fear is the reason for Woil's behavior and emotional state. The fact that Woil's fear is explicitly mentioned and described as causing uncertainty supports the hypothesis that he was afraid."	71
1760505350	1760505351	Premise: But, of course, that just wasn't possible. Her disappointment over Jonathan, which had driven her to France in the first place, had been relegated somewhere to the back of her mind. Now in retrospect she could see that marriage to him would have been a ghastly mistake and that her reaction to discovering that he had been seeing other women while he had been engaged to her had had far more to do with wounded pride than with a wounded heart.  Hypothesis: marriage to Jonathan would have been a ghastly mistake  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that ""marriage to him would have been a ghastly mistake,"" which directly supports the hypothesis. The premise also provides a reason for why she thinks this is the case: her reaction to his infidelity was due to wounded pride rather than a wounded heart, implying that she realizes now that her emotional response was not a deep emotional investment in the relationship."	82
1760505351	1760505353	Premise: Like now. The Community in Knockglen would defend Eve vociferously. Even some of the Sisters here in Dublin might see that the girl had a point.  Hypothesis: the girl had a point  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states that ""The Community in Knockglen would defend Eve vociferously. Even some of the Sisters here in Dublin might see that the girl had a point."" This implies that there are people, specifically some of the Sisters in Dublin, who acknowledge or agree with Eve's perspective.   This directly supports the hypothesis that ""the girl had a point."" The premise suggests that there is at least some validation or recognition of Eve's viewpoint, which is what the hypothesis asserts."	107
1760505353	1760505354	Premise: ``They have to be crushed, Bobkins!'' So saying, she marched off down the gravel path, making the kind of crunching noise Robert had thought could only be produced by the BBC sound-effects department. As they rounded the edge of the building he could see that behind the house was a vast garden.  Hypothesis: behind the house was a vast garden  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states, ""behind the house was a vast garden,"" and this statement is explicitly confirmed by the narrative that follows: ""As they rounded the edge of the building he could see that behind the house was a vast garden."" This confirms that the garden exists behind the house, supporting the hypothesis."	71
1760505354	1760505356	Premise: ``Do you mind if I use your phone?'' Ronni could see that Guido's brain was whirring.  Hypothesis: Guido's brain was whirring  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states that Ronni can see that Guido's brain was whirring, which directly implies that Guido's brain was whirring. The phrase ""can see that"" is an indication of perception, and it shows that Ronni has observed Guido's brain whirring. Therefore, the premise logically supports the hypothesis that Guido's brain was whirring."	88
1760505356	1760505357	Premise: ``Look, lady, give me a break. I just deliver the stuff, I don't interview it for the Sunday papers.'' He waved the paper at her and even at a distance she could see that it said very little.  Hypothesis: the paper said very little  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states that the paper says ""very little,"" which directly supports the hypothesis that the paper said very little. The speaker's statement in the premise is an explicit claim about the content of the paper, and this claim is what the hypothesis is based on. Therefore, the premise provides evidence for the hypothesis, making it entailed by the premise."	80
1760505357	1760505358	Premise: ``You 've heard something like that before. Haven't you, Jimmy?'' Jimmy had been shaken by those sounds more shaken than the others for good reason but Cardiff could see that he was unprepared to show it as he pushed himself away from the reception counter.  Hypothesis: Jimmy was unprepared to show he had been shaken  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states that Jimmy had been shaken by the sounds, and it also states that he was unprepared to show it. This implies that his reluctance to show his reaction is a direct result of having been shaken. The premise directly supports the hypothesis, indicating that the reason he's unprepared to show his reaction is because he has been shaken.	79
1760505358	1760505360	Premise: It was Alan's idea. He made a sour kind of joke out of it, that they must wait until their wedding night. Carolyn agreed because she could see he meant it although she didn't understand why.  Hypothesis: Alan meant it  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states that Alan made a joke about waiting until their wedding night, and Carolyn agreed because she understood that he meant it, even though she didn't understand why. The fact that Carolyn inferred that Alan meant it implies that his comment was not meant to be taken literally. If Alan had meant it literally, Carolyn would not have understood why he said it, as it wouldn't have been a joke. Therefore, the premise suggests that Alan's statement was a joke, and thus, it entails the hypothesis that he meant it to be a joke.	120
1760505360	1760505363	Premise: And why bother to write anyway? What was there to say? Mary had some vague idea that Adam's parents might suspect he was down here and come to see him.  Hypothesis: Adam was down here  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise mentions Mary having a vague idea that Adam's parents might suspect he was down there and come to see him, but it does not provide any information about whether Adam is actually present or not.  The premise only talks about Mary's thought or idea, which is a possibility, not a fact. It does not provide any evidence or confirmation that Adam is indeed down there. The hypothesis that Adam was down there is a separate statement that needs to be tested or confirmed through additional information or evidence.  In other words, the premise is about Mary's thought or suspicion, but it does not provide any objective evidence to support the hypothesis that Adam is down there.	142
1760505363	1760505364	Premise: ``And you're not having this dress,'' Nora said, bending down to look at the price tag. ``It's two and a half guineas!'' she hissed at Louise who could tell that she was genuinely appalled.  Hypothesis: Nora was genuinely appalled  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The text explicitly states that Nora was ""genuinely appalled"" at the price of the dress. This indicates that the premise is presenting Nora's emotional state as a fact, rather than leaving it open to interpretation. The use of the word ""genuinely"" further emphasizes that her reaction is sincere and not feigned."	75
1760505364	1760505365	Premise: She said good morning to Alice and Alice said hallo. She was thin and rather tall with a very lined gentle face and hair that was white but which Alice could see had once been blonde. She could also have told this was Tina's mother before Mrs Darne went off down the passage that led to the Headmaster's Flat.  Hypothesis: this was Tina's mother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that ""She could also have told this was Tina's mother"" which directly supports the hypothesis. The phrase ""could also have told"" implies that the characteristics described (the woman's physical appearance) are consistent with Tina's mother, making it a reasonable conclusion to infer that this is indeed Tina's mother."	73
1760505365	1760505369	Premise: She might have sat all afternoon, nibbling and stuporous, exhausted but not sleepy. But the glazier finally came down from the upper floor, cheerfully announcing that all was now right and tight and he would be on his way. Maggie could tell that he would have liked to stop for a chat that he felt sorry for her left on her own but she lacked either her grandmother's grace or her mother's energy so she did not offer him tea.  Hypothesis: the glazier would have liked to stop for a chat  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states, ""the glazier finally came down from the upper floor, cheerfully announcing that all was now right and tight and he would be on his way."" This suggests that the glazier was in a good mood and had a positive disposition. It is then further stated that ""he would have liked to stop for a chat"" which is a natural consequence of his cheerful demeanor. This implies that the glazier's cheerfulness is the reason he would have liked to stop for a chat.   The phrase ""he felt sorry for her left on her own"" further reinforces this implication. It suggests that the glazier's cheerfulness is accompanied by a sympathetic or kind sentiment towards Maggie, making it more likely that he would want to engage in conversation with her. Therefore, the premise provides evidence that supports the hypothesis that the glazier would have liked to stop for a chat."	191
1760505369	1760505370	Premise: Jim waited. He waited a long time, and when the young doctor finally came out, it was almost dark. Jim could nonetheless tell by his anxious face that something was wrong.  Hypothesis: something was wrong  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise explicitly states that the young doctor's anxious face indicates that ""something was wrong,"" which directly supports the hypothesis that something was wrong. The use of the word ""anxious"" is a strong indicator of the doctor's emotional state, implying that he has received bad news or has concerns about the situation. The fact that the doctor took a long time to come out also suggests that something significant may have been discovered or discussed, further supporting the hypothesis."	101
1760505370	1760505372	Premise: ``Yes?'' ``Nathan?'' He could tell it was long-distance the line was so gravelly and hollow but he didn't recognise the voice.  Hypothesis: the call was long-distance  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The phrase ""He could tell it was long-distance the line was so gravelly and hollow"" directly supports the hypothesis that the call was long-distance. The description of the line being ""gravelly and hollow"" is a common characteristic of long-distance calls, often due to the compression and degradation of the signal as it travels over long distances. This phrase is used to justify the hypothesis that the call is long-distance, indicating that the premise assumes or implies the hypothesis."	103
1760505372	1760505374	Premise: Chopra stood unsteadily on his feet. The shapechanger bounded around with excitement. Chopra could tell something had happened.  Hypothesis: something had happened  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that ""Chopra stood unsteadily on his feet. The shapechanger bounded around with excitement,"" which implies that something has occurred that has caused Chopra to be unsteady on his feet and the shapechanger to be excited. This implies that an event or situation has taken place that has led to this reaction, which is what the hypothesis states: ""something had happened."""	88
1760505374	1760505377	Premise: It seemed impossible that anyone could endure such pain for so long, but at last the doors of the Renault slammed and there was comparative silence. The engine was started up, revving violently as the car was turned round on the narrow road. John could tell that it was being driven back up the hill towards Putna.  Hypothesis: the car was being driven back up the hill towards Putna  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states, ""It seemed impossible that anyone could endure such pain for so long, but at last the doors of the Renault slammed and there was comparative silence."" This is followed by, ""The engine was started up, revving violently as the car was turned round on the narrow road.""   The crucial part is ""as the car was turned round on the narrow road."" This implies that the car is no longer moving forward but is now reversing or turning around. The next sentence states, ""John could tell that it was being driven back up the hill towards Putna."" This directly connects the action of turning the car around on the narrow road to the car being driven back up the hill towards Putna.  Therefore, the premise logically leads to the hypothesis that the car is being driven back up the hill towards Putna."	177
1760505377	1760505380	Premise: Just when you think you 've got it straight, along comes the Fool with his pig's bladder and whops you on the nose. By the way, I'm no idiot. I could tell Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see me at the airport.  Hypothesis: Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see her at the airport  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise does entail the hypothesis. The phrase ""Just when you think you've got it straight, along comes the Fool with his pig's bladder and whops you on the nose"" is a metaphorical expression that suggests a sudden and unexpected turn of events or a revelation that undermines one's previous understanding.   The second part of the premise, ""By the way, I'm no idiot. I could tell Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see me at the airport,"" explicitly states the hypothesis that Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see her at the airport. This statement directly relates to the metaphorical expression that precedes it, implying that the unexpected turn of events or revelation was the realization that Gillian and Stuart weren't happy to see her.   Therefore, the premise provides evidence that supports the hypothesis, making it a valid entailment."	173
1760505380	1760505381	Premise: He's weird enough to have undressed me without thinking, according to some mad notion of the ``proper'' thing to do. Perhaps he thought I couldn't lie in bed with my clothes on.  Hypothesis: she couldn't lie in bed with her clothes on  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states that he undressed her without thinking, according to some notion of the ""proper"" thing to do, and it's implied that he did so because he believed she couldn't lie in bed with her clothes on. This directly implies that the reason for undressing her was due to her inability to lie in bed with her clothes on, making the hypothesis a direct consequence of the premise."	90
1760505381	1760505384	Premise: That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort. Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all. But you will perhaps understand that there was a natural tendency on my part in asking what was after all a generous favour from my employer to hint that there was a good professional motive behind my request.  Hypothesis: there was a natural tendency on her part to hint that there was a good professional motive behind her request  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise and the hypothesis both relate to the speaker's decision to mention Miss Kenton to Mr. Farraday. The premise states that it would have been wiser not to mention Miss Kenton given Mr. Farraday's lighthearted and humorous mood, and that the speaker had a natural tendency to hint at a good professional motive behind their request.  The hypothesis states that there was a natural tendency on her part (the speaker's part) to hint that there was a good professional motive behind her request. This is the same person mentioned in the premise, and the hypothesis directly attributes a tendency to her.  Therefore, the premise does entail the hypothesis. The premise provides a reason why mentioning Miss Kenton might not have been the best idea, and the hypothesis is a direct inference of the speaker's character trait.	168
1760505384	1760505385	Premise: But don't dilly-dally for too long. Once it's published we are all going to look a little risible if we have made no adjustments to what is after all known as being predominantly my own design of gallery. Also I am a bit older than the rest of you but you can perhaps understand that I don't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation.  Hypothesis: he doesn't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise mentions that the speaker wants to ""drop dead without a proper and public recantation,"" which implies that they are concerned about not having a public recantation before they pass away. This concern is the hypothesis, which is that the speaker does not want to die without a public recantation."	70
1760505385	1760505387	Premise: I should dearly have liked to know whether they were Europeans or Americans, but I couldn't hear the accents. They appeared to be arguing. I hoped the white men weren't telling him to eliminate all witnesses because I don't believe it would have needed much persuasion.  Hypothesis: eliminating all witnesses would have needed much persuasion  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states ""I don't believe it would have needed much persuasion"" which implies that eliminating all witnesses would require significant persuasion. If the premise were to entail the hypothesis, then the hypothesis should logically follow from the premise. Since the premise already states that eliminating all witnesses would need much persuasion, the hypothesis that eliminating all witnesses would have needed much persuasion is a direct consequence of the premise and is thus entailed."	91
1760505387	1760505389	Premise: But the damage was done as far as my faith was concerned, which is probably why I went mad. So anyway, that Christmas Eve night confirmed my worst fears, it was like a kind of ``royal flush'' for the infant Jimbo. All three kings - Pa Santa and the King of Kings - all down the pan together... And to be honest I don't believe any of them stands a chance of ever making a comeback with me.  Hypothesis: any of the three kings stands a chance of ever making a comeback with him  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states ""it was like a kind of ``royal flush'' for the infant Jimbo. All three kings - Pa Santa and the King of Kings - all down the pan together..."", which implies that all three kings have failed in some way. However, the hypothesis states that any of the three kings stands a chance of ever making a comeback with him.   Since the premise implies that all three kings have failed, and the hypothesis states that any of them has a chance of making a comeback, this means the premise does entail the hypothesis."	118
1760505389	1760505392	Premise: He had seen something I should have, which was a car turning in from Soho Square and coming up behind me. My right foot hovered over the accelerator pedal and I balanced Armstrong on the clutch. I wasn't as convinced as Malpass that Nevil was out of harm's way.  Hypothesis: Nevil was out of harm's way  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that ""He had seen something I should have, which was a car turning in from Soho Square and coming up behind me,"" which suggests that the person in the premise was able to see the car behind the narrator. The premise also mentions that the narrator ""wasn't as convinced as Malpass that Nevil was out of harm's way,"" which implies that Malpass was convinced that Nevil was out of harm's way, and the narrator is not entirely convinced. This implies that the car turning in from Soho Square is a potential threat to Nevil, and since the narrator is not convinced that Nevil is out of harm's way, it can be inferred that Nevil is indeed out of harm's way, which is the hypothesis."	163
1760505392	1760505393	Premise: Jed wondered. He 'd scarcely set eyes on him since the night they 'd had dinner together at the house in Westwood. Nobody had mentioned him either and Jed didn't feel he should ask.  Hypothesis: Jed should ask  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that Jed hasn't seen or heard about the person since the dinner, and it implies that Jed is curious about the person. The fact that Jed is thinking about asking and is hesitant to do so suggests that he is considering the action of asking, which is the hypothesis. The premise sets the stage for Jed's thought process and decision-making, which leads to the hypothesis that he should ask.	90
1760505393	1760505395	Premise: Yet what good came from knowing that a woman had killed herself? The children who had suffered a trauma would survive the experience, scarred by it and a little flawed by it. They would never forget that for a week they had imagined the act of murder had been committed.  Hypothesis: for a week the children had imagined the act of murder had been committed  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that the children had imagined the act of murder had been committed, and this directly corresponds to the hypothesis. The premise provides a specific detail about the children's experience, which is that they had imagined the act of murder for a week, directly supporting the hypothesis.  In entailment, the premise provides a necessary condition or a specific detail that is directly related to the hypothesis. In this case, the premise provides a clear and specific condition (the children imagining the act of murder for a week) that directly supports the hypothesis.	117
1760505395	1760505397	Premise: Nora calculated that there must be lots of single men up there so she decided it was ideal for the ``manhunt'', as we called it, even though the train fare was a serious consideration. I remember we went up to Euston together one Saturday morning, very excited, to buy the ticket in advance. It was a secret - if my parents had known she was going away alone they would have soon put the kybosh on it.  Hypothesis: Nora was going away alone  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states that Nora ""decided it was ideal for the 'manhunt', as we called it, even though the train fare was a serious consideration"" and that they ""went up to Euston together one Saturday morning, very excited, to buy the ticket in advance."" The key phrase here is ""they went up to Euston together"", which implies that Nora was accompanied by the narrator. This directly contradicts the hypothesis that Nora was going away alone."	105
1760505397	1760505399	Premise: His mother driving the car, so happy, young-looking and fashionably dressed and his father, a big, confident man in a smart suit, smiling and turning round to say something to Simon in the back seat. Marie thought of her own mother with her frumpy clothes and ageing, lined face. No one would have guessed that she was only forty-two.  Hypothesis: Marie's mother was only forty-two  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise provides information that Marie's mother is only forty-two, which directly supports the hypothesis. The details about her appearance, such as her frumpy clothes and ageing, lined face, contrast with the descriptions of the other characters' appearances, implying that Marie's mother is older than she appears to be. This supports the claim that Marie's mother is forty-two, which is relatively young.	88
1760505399	1760505401	Premise: ``I hope you are settling down and the cat is well.'' This was a lie. She did not hope the cat was well.  Hypothesis: the cat was well  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""I hope you are settling down and the cat is well"" entails the hypothesis ""the cat was well.""   The reason is that the premise is a statement that includes a claim about the cat's well-being. The word ""hope"" is used in a way that implies a statement about the cat's current state, rather than a desire for the cat to be well in the future. This suggests that the speaker is making a statement about the cat's current well-being, which would be the hypothesis.   However, the fact that the premise is a lie indicates that the speaker is not actually stating the truth about the cat's well-being. This means the premise does not actually entail the hypothesis, because the hypothesis is not supported by the facts."	153
1760505401	1760505403	Premise: Jane ate without pausing. Hunger was an unknown experience. She had never imagined it could actually hurt.  Hypothesis: hunger could actually hurt  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that Jane ate without pausing and that hunger was an unknown experience, implying that she was never hungry and therefore didn't experience hunger as a sensation. This suggests that hunger is not a necessary or universal experience, which in turn supports the hypothesis that hunger could actually hurt.  The phrase ""Hunger was an unknown experience"" implies that the author is exploring the possibility that hunger might be a negative or unpleasant sensation, which is the core of the hypothesis. The premise is setting the stage for the hypothesis to be tested or explored in the story, making it a logical entailment."	128
1760505403	1760505405	Premise: Miss Martindale had had a school, but her rigid ideas and stern manner had frightened the children, and their parents had taken them away. And gradually the school declined, until she had to give it up and retire to end her days in the white cottage with the inevitable cat as her only companion. Breeze had never imagined that digging was such hard work.  Hypothesis: digging was such hard work  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise describes Miss Martindale's situation, mentioning her school declining and her eventual retirement to a white cottage, but it does not mention the specific task of digging or its difficulty. The mention of digging is made in the second sentence, which is attributed to Breeze, a separate character, and is not a part of the premise itself. Therefore, the premise does not imply that digging is hard work.	92
1760505405	1760505407	Premise: ``You don't need to worry. We're quite adequately chaperoned. Rosa is a woman of strict moral principles.'' If she knows I'm in here she's probably hovering outside the door right now.  Hypothesis: he's in here  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states that Rosa is a woman of strict moral principles and that if she knew the speaker was in this situation, she would likely be nearby, implying that she is currently outside the door. This suggests that the speaker believes Rosa is aware of their current situation and is taking action to chaperone them. The use of the word ""probably"" in the premise is a hint that the speaker has reason to believe Rosa is aware of their situation and is taking action, which supports the hypothesis that they are in this situation."	113
1760505407	1760505407	Premise: I said you were mad to come over at this time. It's a world event. Don't you know that Venice is packed with visitors?  Hypothesis: Venice is packed with visitors  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise entails the hypothesis.   The word ""packed"" implies a large number of people, which directly supports the hypothesis that Venice is packed with visitors."	32
1760505407	1760505409	Premise: And what she had said, and went on saying quietly, calmly, efficiently, was that she loved Maggie. She paid attention. At eight Maggie had not known that her grandmother was famous but she had seen that people had something in their manner when they looked at Rachel.  Hypothesis: Maggie's grandmother was famous  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states that ""people had something in their manner when they looked at Rachel,"" which implies that Rachel is someone notable or well-known. The phrase ""something in their manner"" suggests a change in behavior or reaction that is often associated with recognizing or acknowledging someone famous or influential. This inference, combined with the context that Maggie's grandmother is the one being referred to as Rachel, supports the hypothesis that Maggie's grandmother was famous."	96
1760505409	1760505411	Premise: They 'd seen Miss Lavant on the promenade and about the town, always walking slowly, sometimes with a neat wicker basket. Kate had often thought she was beautiful. She hadn't known she was in love with Dr Greenslade who had a wife already and three children.  Hypothesis: Miss Lavant was in love with Dr Greenslade  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise only mentions that Kate thinks Miss Lavant is beautiful and that she is seen walking with a wicker basket. There is no information that suggests Miss Lavant is in love with Dr. Greenslade. The information that Dr. Greenslade is married and has children is also not relevant to Miss Lavant's feelings or actions.   To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to include information that directly suggests Miss Lavant's romantic feelings towards Dr. Greenslade, such as her actions or expressions being motivated by a desire to be with him or to impress him.	127
1760505411	1760505412	Premise: Did he intend everyone in the castle to know he did not want the wife he had married in such a hurry? Did he intend to ignore her completely? Then Isabel saw Ellen's stunned face and realised that her maid at least did not know she had spent the night alone.  Hypothesis: Isabel had spent the night alone  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states that Isabel saw Ellen's stunned face, implying that Ellen had not known that Isabel had spent the night alone. This suggests that Isabel did spend the night alone.	45
1760505412	1760505415	Premise: Most of them young, about his age, stood and talked and drank and laughed. The two girls he had noticed earlier were standing talking to some other girls. Graham hoped they all realised that just because he was standing talking to Slater that didn't mean he was gay too.  Hypothesis: Graham was gay too  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The key sentence in the premise that supports this conclusion is: ""The two girls he had noticed earlier were standing talking to some other girls."" This implies that Graham had been interested in or noticed the girls, suggesting that he might be attracted to them.   However, the more direct and explicit statement that supports the hypothesis is: ""Graham hoped they all realised that just because he was standing talking to Slater that didn't mean he was gay too."" This sentence implies that Graham is worried about being mistaken for being gay because he is associating with Slater, suggesting that Graham is concerned about being perceived as gay, which is a strong indicator that he might actually be gay himself."	145
1760505415	1760505417	Premise: He said that maybe I wasn't ready to join the Party just yet. Terry's passion for equality appealed to my purer mind, and his hatred of existing authority appealed to my resentments. But although I hated inequality it didn't mean I wanted to be treated like everyone else.  Hypothesis: he wanted to be treated like everyone else  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise mentions that the narrator was drawn to Terry's hatred of existing authority, implying that the narrator shares this sentiment. However, the narrator also mentions that they didn't want to be treated like everyone else. This suggests that the narrator values individuality and does not want to conform to the group.   The premise does not provide any information about Terry's personal desires or whether he wants to be treated like everyone else. It only mentions the narrator's reaction to Terry's ideas and how it aligns with their own feelings.	117
1760505417	1760505420	Premise: ``Oh, my poor Folly... We 've been together for five years, Lexy and I - she practically holds that company together. Of course I gave her an ``A''. But that doesn't mean I'm having an affair with her.  Hypothesis: he is having an affair with Lexy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The phrase ""Oh, my poor Folly"" and ""We've been together for five years"" suggests that the speaker is in a romantic relationship with Folly, implying a deep emotional connection. The speaker then mentions giving Folly an ""A"", which implies that Folly is someone the speaker has authority over, likely in a work or academic setting. However, the speaker then immediately follows this by saying ""But that doesn't mean I'm having an affair with her"", which suggests that the speaker is aware that the context implies an affair and is explicitly denying it.  This denial implies that there is a reason to suspect an affair in the first place, and the speaker's tone suggests that the suspicion is not unfounded. The fact that the speaker feels the need to deny the affair at all suggests that there is a plausible reason to suspect one, which is what the hypothesis states."	188
1760505420	1760505421	Premise: Nevertheless, her heart sank at the thought of spending an evening with him in his present state of mind, and she was tempted to invent a sore throat in order to get out of it. But he had been very helpful over the Puddephat business, she admitted to herself, and his moods were unpredictable - he might be on top of the world by the time he arrived at the cinema. ``I'm still keen if you are '' she said brightly pretending she had not noticed anything was amiss.  Hypothesis: something was amiss  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The passage explicitly states that her ""heart sank at the thought of spending an evening with him in his present state of mind"", which suggests that she is aware of something being wrong with him. The phrase ""present state of mind"" implies that his mental state is not normal or usual, which supports the hypothesis that something is amiss."	76
1760505421	1760505423	Premise: What must it be like to be imprisoned here, day after day, month after month? I wonder, does he keep them chained and manacled, thought Fenella, or does he use sorcery? And so utterly immersed was she in this strange blue and green land that was not feeling strange any more that she did not even notice that she was weighing sorcery against steel chains and seriously considering the likely outcome.  Hypothesis: Fenella was weighing sorcery against steel chains  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states, ""And so utterly immersed was she in this strange blue and green land that was not feeling strange any more that she did not even notice that she was weighing sorcery against steel chains and seriously considering the likely outcome."" This indicates that Fenella is indeed considering the use of sorcery as an alternative to steel chains, which is the hypothesis."	81
1760505423	1760505425	Premise: Strasbourg, Vienna, Bucharest, Istanbul, not stopping, not looking back. I saw her tossing newly gauffred curls as the open roadster headed east, away from Ollie... Temporarily I managed to re-erect my jocular facade, but inside I was panicking. He could take her away I thought he could just do that he has such power to hurt me this little furry creature who hasn't even noticed that I 've given up the weed.  Hypothesis: he has given up the weed  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that the narrator has given up the weed, but there is no information provided about Ollie, the person who is taking the little furry creature away, and his behavior regarding the weed. The narrator's thought about Ollie having the power to hurt them implies that Ollie might have control over the narrator or the little furry creature, but it doesn't provide any information about Ollie's relationship with the weed.  The hypothesis that Ollie has given up the weed is a separate piece of information that is not supported by the premise. The premise only provides information about the narrator's emotional state and the events unfolding in the scene, but it does not provide any information about Ollie's actions or decisions regarding the weed.	163
1760505425	1760505428	Premise: It - the tractor, the boys and the bulbs in the earth - knew she had chosen for them and was coming back to them. Of course there was still love, there was healthy, growing love and its name was called Work. She had fallen in love with it so slowly and gently and sweetly that she had never noticed it had happened.  Hypothesis: falling in love had happened  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that ""Of course there was still love, there was healthy, growing love and its name was called Work,"" which directly implies that the subject (she) had fallen in love with Work. The phrase ""she had fallen in love with it so slowly and gently and sweetly that she had never noticed it had happened"" further supports this implication, as it describes the process of falling in love with Work.  The use of the word ""of course"" also suggests that the falling in love with Work is a given or an established fact, which is the hypothesis being proposed. Therefore, the premise is providing evidence or support for the hypothesis, making it an entailment."	146
1760505428	1760505429	Premise: After the twelfth dot, two thirds of the way down the page, the transcript of this long session tails away into blank paper. I suppose what's happened is this. He has gone on staring out of the window thinking and she has gone on staring at him waiting with such absorption that neither of them noticed the tape had run out.  Hypothesis: the tape had run out  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that the transcript ""tails away into blank paper"" after the twelfth dot, which is a clear indication that the recording or transcription has stopped due to the tape running out. This directly implies that the tape had indeed run out, making the hypothesis a logical consequence of the premise."	68
1760505429	1760505430	Premise: ``His name is Matthew Blake,'' Mandy informed Charity as they descended the steps from their cabin on to the paved pathway that led to the lodge. Thankfully she hadn't even noticed that Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt and was now wearing red shorts with her white silk blouse.  Hypothesis: Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt and is now wearing red shorts with her white silk blouse. This directly implies that the hypothesis is true: Charity did change from the blue wrap-around skirt.	53
1760505430	1760505432	Premise: ``These ` ere smugglers is a dangerous bunch from wot I 've ` eard!'' ``If only we could devise a safe way of laying our hands on all that money,'' murmured Pugwash, whose greed was as proverbial as his cowardice. And the pirates were so busy discussing the problem and what they would do with the reward if they won it that they didn't notice that they were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage.  Hypothesis: the pirates were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise explicitly states: ""the pirates were so busy discussing the problem and what they would do with the reward if they won it that they didn't notice that they were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage.""  This sentence directly implies that the pirates were being observed from the window above by the new Mayor and his entourage. The premise provides evidence that supports the hypothesis, making it a necessary consequence of the premise."	103
1760505432	1760505433	Premise: Ockleton, Morpurgo, Cornelius, Dysart and half a dozen others too drunk to mention. But there was so much coming and going that any one of us could have slipped out, pushed Everett through the window and slipped back again without being noticed. Damn it all we didn't even notice Everett was missing until a porter tripped over him in the quad so anything's theoretically possible.  Hypothesis: Everett was missing  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states ""But there was so much coming and going that any one of us could have slipped out, pushed Everett through the window and slipped back again without being noticed."" This directly implies that Everett is missing, as it mentions the possibility of someone pushing him through a window. The phrase ""without being noticed"" further emphasizes that Everett's absence is already a fact, making the hypothesis a consequence of the situation described in the premise."	95
1760505433	1760505437	Premise: His hair was white, as my daughters reported when they went to view the body before it was given to the Odonata. Now he is known as The Man Who Changed the World, and there are statues to him everywhere. No one remembers he had a younger brother.  Hypothesis: The Man Who Changed the World had a younger brother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that ""His hair was white, as my daughters reported when they went to view the body before it was given to the Odonata,"" which implies that the person being described had hair that was white at some point in their life. It also states that ""he is now known as The Man Who Changed the World,"" and that there are statues to him everywhere, suggesting that he is a historical figure who has been widely recognized and celebrated.  The phrase ""no one remembers he had a younger brother"" suggests that there is a contrast between the widespread recognition of The Man Who Changed the World and the fact that his younger brother is unknown. This contrast implies that the younger brother's existence is being obscured or forgotten, which is consistent with the idea that The Man Who Changed the World is the more prominent and well-known figure.  Given this information, it is reasonable to infer that The Man Who Changed the World and the younger brother are the same person, which would mean that the premise entails the hypothesis."	213
1760505437	1760505438	Premise: Oh, I did, I did! I was lucky. I would have liked brothers and sisters but I don't remember that I was ever lonely.  Hypothesis: she was ever lonely  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that she was lucky and mentions not remembering being lonely. This implies that she might have been lonely, but the lack of memory about it suggests that her experience of loneliness might not have been significant or impactful enough to be remembered. However, it doesn't necessarily confirm that she was ever lonely.	73
1760505438	1760505440	Premise: Her priggishness. I admire it. I know she does wrong things she tries to organize other people's lives she can't see Mr Knightley is a man in a million.  Hypothesis: Mr Knightley is a man in a million  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise describes a character's admiration for someone's ""priggishness"" and mentions that they cannot see that the person they are criticizing (presumably the object of their admiration) is trying to organize other people's lives, which implies that they are judging others harshly. However, the premise also specifically states that this person cannot see that Mr. Knightley is a ""man in a million,"" which suggests that the speaker admires Mr. Knightley and sees him as exceptional. This implies that Mr. Knightley is indeed a ""man in a million,"" which is the hypothesis."	129
1760505440	1760505443	Premise: Only she herself knew the evil thoughts she had and how effortlessly they could be translated into action. ``I 'll make a cup of tea.'' No she would not tell Peter that the person he loved most in the world was dead.  Hypothesis: the person Peter loved most in the world was dead  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states that the person Peter loved most in the world was dead, but this is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred from the context that the speaker is considering withholding this information from Peter. The speaker says, ""No she would not tell Peter that the person he loved most in the world was dead,"" which implies that the person Peter loved most in the world is indeed deceased, and the speaker is aware of this fact. This inference is further supported by the phrase ""Only she herself knew the evil thoughts she had and how effortlessly they could be translated into action,"" which suggests that the speaker is hiding a dark secret, and the fact that the person Peter loves is dead is a part of that secret."	155
1760505443	1760505446	Premise: ``It's not your day, is it, dear?'' ``No, but they 've got to be done, and Shirley's making the tea.'' Ianthe had not told her mother that she sometimes had to dust the books in the library.  Hypothesis: Ianthe sometimes had to dust the books in the library  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states that Ianthe sometimes had to dust the books in the library. The phrase ""Ianthe had not told her mother that she sometimes had to dust the books in the library"" indicates that Ianthe does have this task, but is keeping it a secret from her mother. The statement ""It's not your day, is it, dear? 'No, but they've got to be done, and Shirley's making the tea'"" suggests that Ianthe is doing chores, and the ""they've got to be done"" part is likely referring to these tasks, which include dusting the books in the library.  Therefore, the premise directly supports the hypothesis that Ianthe sometimes has to dust the books in the library."	157
1760505446	1760505448	Premise: He pulled occasionally, his arms tiring. Conker slowed a little, but the branches were coming too fast, he had to lean right forward and couldn't use his hands. He remembered the gate at the end of the track had time to hope it was open because he didn't think Conker could jump it.  Hypothesis: Conker could jump the gate  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that Conker is having trouble with the branches coming too fast and can't use his hands, which suggests that Conker might not be able to jump the gate. The fact that the gate has time to hope it is open implies that Conker might need the gate to be open to pass through it. This creates a scenario where Conker might not be able to clear the gate even if it is open, which contradicts the hypothesis that Conker can jump the gate.	110
1760505448	1760505450	Premise: But he ended up eating it himself. I was reluctant to kiss my mother, afraid that somehow her weakness and unhappiness would infect me. Naturally I didn't think for a minute that my life and spirit could stimulate her.  Hypothesis: her life and spirit could stimulate her mother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that the speaker was reluctant to kiss their mother because they feared that her weakness and unhappiness would ""infect"" them, implying a negative transfer of emotions. This suggests that the speaker believes their mother's negative emotions would have a detrimental effect on them.  On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests that the speaker's life and spirit could stimulate their mother, implying a positive transfer of emotions. This is the opposite of the speaker's fear in the premise. The premise and the hypothesis are contradictory, as the premise suggests that the speaker's mother's emotions would have a negative effect, while the hypothesis suggests that the speaker's emotions would have a positive effect on their mother."	150
1760505450	1760505451	Premise: ``Ely,'' I said (that was her name and the first time I 'd ever used it), ``I want to be free.'' She looked stunned. I don't think she 'd considered this.  Hypothesis: Ely had considered him wanting to be free  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that Ely looked ""stunned,"" which suggests that she was surprised by his statement. This implies that she had not previously considered the possibility of him wanting to be free. If she had considered it, she would likely not have been surprised by his statement."	67
1760505451	1760505453	Premise: I'm sorry, I 've put you in an invidious position. If you're being run by Morton, he 'll want to hear all this. It won't do any harm but I 'd rather not give him food for thought because I consider him an idiot and I don't think he's capable of interpreting it correctly.  Hypothesis: Morton is capable of interpreting this food for thought correctly  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states that Morton will want to hear all the information, implying that he is capable of understanding and processing it. It does not provide any evidence that he is incapable of interpreting it correctly, only that you consider him an idiot and do not think he can interpret it correctly.	64
1760505453	1760505454	Premise: The big Norwegian shook his head, frowning. ``Jeg fonstAr ikke.'' I don't think he found Ward's accent at all easy and anyway like many foreigners he found it easier to speak English than to understand it.  Hypothesis: the big Norwegian found Ward's accent at all easy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states that the big Norwegian ""shook his head, frowning. 'Jeg fonstAr ikke.'"" This implies that the Norwegian is having difficulty understanding Ward, which in turn suggests that he finds Ward's accent difficult. The phrase ""Jeg fonstAr ikke"" translates to ""I don't think"" or ""I don't understand,"" further reinforcing this idea."	87
1760505454	1760505457	Premise: You really don't know anything about me, do you, despite all that wallowing in my mind? As it happens I don't think I'm the right person to lead humanity into the future no.  Hypothesis: she is the right person to lead humanity into the future  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""You really don't know anything about me, do you, despite all that wallowing in my mind"" and the hypothesis ""she is the right person to lead humanity into the future"" are not directly related.   The premise suggests a lack of knowledge or understanding about the speaker, which does not necessarily imply anything about their ability to lead humanity into the future. It's possible that the speaker is right, and they don't know much about the person in question, but that doesn't provide any information about their potential as a leader.  To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we would need a different premise, such as ""You have been studying and analyzing me, despite not knowing much about me."" This new premise would imply that there is some level of knowledge or understanding about the speaker, which could be used to assess their potential as a leader.  In the current scenario, the premise and hypothesis are unrelated, so the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	198
1760505457	1760505458	Premise: It's where the bands practise. I can't remember what band Petra's in, but I seen them practise once. They were OK but I didn't think they was brilliant.  Hypothesis: Petra's band was brilliant  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that Petra's band was ""OK but I didn't think they was brilliant."" This implies that Petra's band was not brilliant, which directly contradicts the hypothesis that Petra's band was brilliant."	54
1760505458	1760505460	Premise: She swallowed hard, unsure if she had the nerve to go ahead. The memory of the pain in Tara's eyes last night decided her. Did he really expect her to believe that Tara was only the housekeeper?  Hypothesis: Tara was only the housekeeper  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise entails the hypothesis. The phrase ""Did he really expect her to believe that Tara was only the housekeeper"" suggests that there is doubt about the true nature of Tara's role, implying that there might be more to it than just being a housekeeper. This suggests that the hypothesis that Tara was only the housekeeper is likely false, and the speaker is considering an alternative explanation (i.e., that Tara was more than just a housekeeper)."	92
1760505460	1760505464	Premise: If there are spirits at work at the time, they come only from yourself, not from the fume of the incense. Why should spirits aid living beings? What arrogance is it that drives people to believe they can have power over them?  Hypothesis: people can have power over spirits  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise is: ""If there are spirits at work at the time, they come only from yourself, not from the fume of the incense.""  This premise does not entail the hypothesis ""people can have power over spirits."" Here's why:  The premise only describes the origin of spirits (they come from the self, not from external sources like incense) but does not address the question of whether people can influence or control these spirits. It is possible to believe in the existence of internal spirits without believing that people have power over them. The premise leaves open the possibility that these internal spirits may be autonomous, unresponsive, or even malevolent.  For example, someone could believe that their internal thoughts and emotions are spirits, but also believe that these spirits are beyond their control, and that they are at the mercy of these internal forces. In this case, the premise would be true (the spirits come from within), but the hypothesis (people can have power over spirits) would be false.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	215
1760505464	1760505468	Premise: Why should this topic matter? You talked about everything else as you usually do. Why should I feel Maelmuire is important?  Hypothesis: Maelmuire is important  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""Why should this topic matter? You talked about everything else as you usually do. Why should I feel Maelmuire is important?"" does not directly entail the hypothesis ""Maelmuire is important.""  The premise is asking for justification or explanation for why Maelmuire should be considered important, implying that there might be a lack of understanding or connection to why Maelmuire is significant. The speaker is essentially asking for a reason to care about Maelmuire, which is a rhetorical question.  The hypothesis ""Maelmuire is important"" is a statement that asserts the importance of Maelmuire without providing any justification or reason. The premise and the hypothesis are related but distinct, as the premise is asking for a justification for the hypothesis.  To make the premise entail the hypothesis, it would need to be rephrased to something like ""You've talked about everything else as you usually do, so you should also feel that Maelmuire is important."" This revised premise directly implies that Maelmuire is important because the speaker has already discussed other topics, which suggests a connection or relevance to Maelmuire."	238
1760505468	1760505470	Premise: It is all very well, in these changing times, to adapt one's work to take in duties not traditionally within one's realm. But bantering is of another dimension altogether. For one thing how would one know for sure that at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected?  Hypothesis: at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise suggests that adapting to changing times to take on new duties is one thing, but bantering is a different dimension. It implies that bantering is a distinct aspect that may not be easily adaptable to changing circumstances or situations. The premise does not assert that a response of the bantering sort is expected at any given moment, it only highlights the distinction between adapting to new duties and engaging in banter.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that at any given moment, a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected. This is a specific claim about the nature of bantering and expectations in a given situation. The premise does not provide any information that would necessitate this hypothesis.	153
1760505470	1760505471	Premise: But the horror of losing was as much to do with money as with pride. Biddy had never let them down, come without fail all through the bad weather, and now was giving Nails an intensive course on her own horse which - in terms of money - was worth another couple of hundred pounds. Yet surely she knew they had no way of paying should she demand it?  Hypothesis: they had no way of paying  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that ""they had no way of paying should she demand it,"" which directly implies that the hypothesis that ""they had no way of paying"" is true. The premise is stating this fact as a reason why Biddy should not demand the money, suggesting that the hypothesis is a known and accepted fact."	72
1760505471	1760505475	Premise: I ducked so fast I wasn't sure whether he 'd seen me or not, but it gave me a prickly feeling just to imagine it, so I scuttled for the door and legged it up the spiral stairway three steps at a time, just in case. As I ran, I remember thinking stupid thoughts like. How did he know I was up here looking down?  Hypothesis: he was up there looking down  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise entails the hypothesis. The phrase ""but it gave me a prickly feeling just to imagine it"" suggests that the speaker is considering the possibility that he saw me, implying that the speaker is thinking about the possibility of being seen. However, the phrase ""but I ducked so fast I wasn't sure whether he'd seen me or not"" suggests that the speaker is unsure whether they were seen, and therefore is entertaining the possibility that he may not have seen them.   However, the speaker then immediately decides to run up the stairs, which is an action typically taken to avoid being seen. This action suggests that the speaker is acting as if they think they may have been seen, which implies that they believe the person may have seen them.   Additionally, the sentence ""As I ran, I remember thinking stupid thoughts like. How did he know I was up here looking down?"" reinforces the idea that the speaker believes the person may have seen them, as the speaker is wondering how they knew they were there.  Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis, as the speaker's actions and thoughts suggest that they believe the person may have seen them."	233
1760505475	1760505479	Premise: At the heart of the universe there is cruelty. We are predators and are preyed upon, every living thing. Did you know that wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds piercing the weak spot in their armour?  Hypothesis: wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise states that ""at the heart of the universe there is cruelty"" and that ""we are predators and are preyed upon, every living thing."" This suggests that the universe is a place where predation and harm are fundamental aspects of life.   The premise does not specifically mention wasps or ladybirds, nor does it make any direct reference to their behavior. However, it implies that predation is a universal aspect of life.  The hypothesis states that ""wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds."" This statement is a specific instance of predation, but it is not a universal truth as implied by the premise. The premise suggests that predation is a fundamental aspect of life, but it does not imply that wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds specifically.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise provides a broader context, while the hypothesis is a specific example within that context."	185
1760505479	1760505480	Premise: ``I wanted to tell you. But the Bookman asked me to keep our meeting a secret.'' How did you know I 'd met him?  Hypothesis: he had met the Bookman  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The statement ""I wanted to tell you. But the Bookman asked me to keep our meeting a secret"" implies that there was a meeting between the speaker and the Bookman. This can only be true if the hypothesis ""he had met the Bookman"" is true.   The premise directly references the Bookman and mentions that there was a meeting between the speaker and the Bookman, making it a necessary condition for the truth of the premise."	100
1760505480	1760505482	Premise: She rubbed them away with an angry fist. She was a fool to let anyone get round her. How long before she learned that folk 'll always take advantage of weakness?  Hypothesis: folk 'll always take advantage of weakness  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states that ""She rubbed them away with an angry fist"" and ""she was a fool to let anyone get round her,"" which implies that she was taken advantage of by others. The phrase ""folk 'll always take advantage of weakness"" is a general statement that explains the reason for her situation. The premise provides a specific example of this general statement, suggesting that the speaker believes this is a universal truth."	94
1760505482	1760505483	Premise: At length she decided that there was nothing to be gained by worrying her. Probably there was some quite innocent explanation, which Roger Kenyon would give her when she returned the wallet - if, indeed, it were his. And yet why had his manner changed so abruptly when he learned that the girl whose hat he had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage?  Hypothesis: the girl whose hat Roger Kenyon had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that ""the girl whose hat he had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage,"" which directly implies that the hypothesis is true. The premise is stating a fact, and the hypothesis is a restatement of that fact. The premise provides evidence to support the hypothesis, making the hypothesis a logical consequence of the premise."	75
1760505483	1760505485	Premise: Anna looked at Peter again and said to herself in a guilty whisper, ``Will he become even more difficult?'' She wondered if a stranger could tell that he was difficult, just by looking at him. Would such a person watching Peter now reading the prayers of Rite B in his level pleasant voice notice that resentment lay like his blood just under his skin because the life he had chosen had not turned out as he had expected it to?  Hypothesis: resentment lay just under Peter's skin  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states that ""resentment lay like his blood just under his skin because the life he had chosen had not turned out as he had expected it to."" This directly implies that resentment is present beneath Peter's surface, which is the hypothesis being discussed. The phrase ""just under his skin"" is a metaphor for internal feelings or emotions, making it clear that resentment is indeed a part of Peter's emotional state."	93
1760505485	1760505488	Premise: Jean was tough and liked to drink. She would endure for a long while yet. But what would she do when she realized that with things as they were she was on a life sentence not just a temporary suspension of essential pleasure?  Hypothesis: Jean was on a life sentence  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise does entail the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states that Jean would ""endure for a long while,"" which suggests a prolonged period of time. Additionally, it mentions that she would ""realize that with things as they were she was on a life sentence,"" which implies that her current situation is likely to last her entire life.  The word ""life sentence"" typically refers to a prison term that lasts for the rest of one's life, suggesting a permanent or long-term situation. The premise's mention of Jean realizing she is on a life sentence strongly implies that her current circumstances (likely her drinking and addiction) will continue indefinitely, which supports the hypothesis that she is indeed on a life sentence.  Therefore, based on the information provided in the premise, it can be inferred that Jean is on a life sentence, which makes the hypothesis entailed."	177
1760505488	1760505490	Premise: ``Clever''. Klug means ``clever''. Would you say that Abie was clever?  Hypothesis: Abie was clever  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""Klug means 'clever'"" entails the hypothesis ""Abie was clever"" because it explicitly states the meaning of ""Klug"" and then directly connects it to Abie by using the name ""Abie"".   In other words, if ""Klug"" indeed means ""clever"", then it logically follows that Abie, who is referred to as ""Abie"", must be clever. The premise provides a clear definition of ""Klug"" and applies it directly to Abie, making the hypothesis a direct consequence of the premise."	113
1760505490	1760505491	Premise: The Susweca. It means ``dragonfly'' in Sioux, you know. Did I ever tell you that's where Paul and I met?  Hypothesis: Susweca is where she and Paul met  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that ""Susweca"" means ""dragonfly"" in Sioux and that it's where you met Paul. This implies that Susweca is the location where the speaker met Paul. Therefore, the hypothesis ""Susweca is where she and Paul met"" is a direct consequence of the premise."	70
1760505491	1760505496	Premise: How do you know? she was going to ask, but his smile was answer enough. If DeVore said there was going to be a vacancy there would be a vacancy.  Hypothesis: there was going to be a vacancy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""How do you know? she was going to ask, but his smile was answer enough. If DeVore said there was going to be a vacancy there would be a vacancy"" does entail the hypothesis ""there was going to be a vacancy"".  Here's why:  1. The premise implies a connection between DeVore's statement and the actual outcome. The sentence ""If DeVore said there was going to be a vacancy there would be a vacancy"" suggests that DeVore's statement is a reliable indicator of the outcome.  2. The phrase ""his smile was answer enough"" implies that DeVore's smile is a sufficient reason to believe that there would be a vacancy. This implies that DeVore's smile is a reliable indicator of the outcome.  3. The use of the word ""enough"" in the phrase ""his smile was answer enough"" suggests that the smile is sufficient to justify the conclusion that there would be a vacancy. This implies that the smile is a reliable indicator of the outcome.  4. The overall tone of the premise suggests that DeVore is someone who is trustworthy and reliable, and that his statement or smile is sufficient to justify a conclusion.  Therefore, based on the connection between DeVore's statement and the outcome, the implication of his smile, and the overall tone of the premise, it can be concluded that the premise entails the hypothesis ""there was going to be a vacancy""."	294
1760505496	1760505498	Premise: She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked. Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit, then came out and was not very successful in finding a job to suit him. That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them.  Hypothesis: it was Edward's fault  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise mentions that Edward ""was not very successful in finding a job to suit him,"" but it does not directly imply that this lack of success is his fault. The phrase ""That wasn't his fault"" suggests that the speaker, Nenna, does not hold Edward responsible for his lack of success. The premise also includes phrases like ""That wasn't his fault"" and ""if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them,"" which indicates that Nenna defends Edward and does not blame him for his lack of success."	122
