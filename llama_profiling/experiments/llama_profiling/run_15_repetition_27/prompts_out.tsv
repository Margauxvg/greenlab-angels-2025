1760498995	1760498998	Premise: No Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq Yet.  Hypothesis: Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq" does not follow from the premise "No Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq Yet."   This is because the premise states that no weapons have been found yet, which implies that the search is ongoing and the conclusion of the search has not been reached. It does not provide any information about whether or not weapons exist in Iraq.   In other words, the premise does not rule out the possibility that weapons might be found in Iraq in the future, and it does not provide any direct evidence to support or refute the hypothesis. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.
1760498998	1760499000	Premise: A place of sorrow, after Pope John Paul II died, became a place of celebration, as Roman Catholic faithful gathered in downtown Chicago to mark the installation of new Pope Benedict XVI.  Hypothesis: Pope Benedict XVI is the new leader of the Roman Catholic Church.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise states that a place of sorrow became a place of celebration after Pope John Paul II died and Pope Benedict XVI was installed. This implies that the event of Pope John Paul II's death and Pope Benedict XVI's installation are connected, and the shift from sorrow to celebration is a direct result of the latter event. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that Pope Benedict XVI is the new leader of the Roman Catholic Church, as his installation would be a significant event in the transition of leadership.
1760499000	1760499001	Premise: Herceptin was already approved to treat the sickest breast cancer patients, and the company said, Monday, it will discuss with federal regulators the possibility of prescribing the drug for more breast cancer patients.  Hypothesis: Herceptin can be used to treat breast cancer.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise. The premise states that Herceptin was already approved to treat the sickest breast cancer patients, which implies that Herceptin is effective in treating breast cancer. The hypothesis that Herceptin can be used to treat breast cancer is a direct inference from this information. The company's intention to discuss with regulators about prescribing the drug for more breast cancer patients further supports this inference, as it suggests that they believe the drug is effective for a broader range of patients.
1760499001	1760499003	Premise: Judie Vivian, chief executive at ProMedica, a medical service company that helps sustain the 2-year-old Vietnam Heart Institute in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), said that so far about 1,500 children have received treatment.  Hypothesis: The previous name of Ho Chi Minh City was Saigon.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise. The premise states that the Vietnam Heart Institute is located in "Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon)", which directly implies that the city's name was changed from Saigon to Ho Chi Minh City. The information about Judie Vivian and the number of children treated is not relevant to the hypothesis, but the phrase "formerly Saigon" provides the necessary evidence to support the hypothesis.
1760499003	1760499006	Premise: A man is due in court later charged with the murder 26 years ago of a teenager whose case was the first to be featured on BBC One's Crimewatch. Colette Aram, 16, was walking to her boyfriend's house in Keyworth, Nottinghamshire, on 30 October 1983 when she disappeared. Her body was later found in a field close to her home. Paul Stewart Hutchinson, 50, has been charged with murder and is due before Nottingham magistrates later.  Hypothesis: Paul Stewart Hutchinson is accused of having stabbed a girl.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Paul Stewart Hutchinson is accused of having stabbed a girl" follows from the premise.   The premise states that Paul Stewart Hutchinson is charged with the murder of a 16-year-old girl, Colette Aram. It also mentions that her body was found in a field close to her home, implying that she died as a result of the alleged crime. Additionally, the context of the article suggests that the case is a violent crime.   The word "stabbed" is a plausible method of causing death in a violent crime, and the fact that the victim was a teenager and the case was featured on a crime show implies that the crime was severe. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that Paul Stewart Hutchinson is accused of having stabbed the girl, making the hypothesis follow from the premise.
1760499006	1760499007	Premise: Britain said, Friday, that it has barred cleric, Omar Bakri, from returning to the country from Lebanon, where he was released by police after being detained for 24 hours.  Hypothesis: Bakri was briefly detained, but was released.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Bakri was briefly detained, but was released" follows from the premise.   The premise states that Bakri was detained for 24 hours and then released by police. This directly implies that he was detained and later released, making the hypothesis a logical consequence of the information provided in the premise.
1760499007	1760499010	Premise: Nearly 4 million children who have at least one parent who entered the U.S. illegally were born in the United States and are U.S. citizens as a result, according to the study conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center. That's about three quarters of the estimated 5.5 million children of illegal immigrants inside the United States, according to the study. About 1.8 million children of undocumented immigrants live in poverty, the study found.  Hypothesis: Three quarters of U.S. illegal immigrants have children.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that three-quarters of the estimated 5.5 million children of illegal immigrants inside the United States are U.S. citizens. This does not imply that three-quarters of the U.S. illegal immigrants have children. The premise only talks about the children of illegal immigrants, not the parents themselves.  In other words, the premise says that 3/4 of the children of illegal immigrants are U.S. citizens, but it does not say anything about the proportion of illegal immigrants who have children. It could be that a small fraction of illegal immigrants have children, and the remaining 3/4 of children of illegal immigrants are from the small number of parents who do have children.  A correct interpretation of the premise would be: "Three-quarters of the children of U.S. illegal immigrants are U.S. citizens."
1760499010	1760499012	Premise: Like the United States, U.N. officials are also dismayed that Aristide killed a conference called by Prime Minister Robert Malval in Port-au-Prince in hopes of bringing all the feuding parties together.  Hypothesis: Aristide had Prime Minister Robert Malval  murdered in Port-au-Prince.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Aristide killed a conference called by Prime Minister Robert Malval in Port-au-Prince. The key word here is "killed," which implies that Aristide caused the conference to fail or ended it prematurely, but does not necessarily mean that he physically harmed or murdered Malval.  In fact, the premise only mentions that Aristide killed the conference, not that he killed Malval. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Aristide had Malval murdered based on the given information.
1760499012	1760499012	Premise: WASHINGTON --  A newly declassified narrative of the Bush administration's advice to the CIA on harsh interrogations shows that the small group of Justice Department lawyers who wrote memos authorizing controversial interrogation techniques were operating not on their own but with direction from top administration officials, including then-Vice President Dick Cheney and national security adviser Condoleezza Rice. At the same time, the narrative suggests that then-Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and then-Secretary of State Colin Powell were largely left out of the decision-making process.  Hypothesis: Dick Cheney was the Vice President of Bush.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise. The premise states that "then-Vice President Dick Cheney" was involved in the decision-making process. This directly implies that Dick Cheney held the office of Vice President under the Bush administration, which is the hypothesis.
1760499012	1760499014	Premise: Only a week after it had no comment on upping the storage capacity of its Hotmail e-mail service, Microsoft early Thursday announced it was boosting the allowance to 250MB to follow similar moves by rivals such as Google, Yahoo, and Lycos.  Hypothesis: Microsoft's Hotmail has raised its storage capacity to 250MB.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise. The premise states that Microsoft announced it was boosting the storage capacity of its Hotmail e-mail service to 250MB, just a week after having no comment on upping the storage capacity. This implies that the storage capacity was increased to 250MB.
1760499014	1760499015	Premise: Lina Joy, 42, was born Azlina Jailani to Malay parents, and was raised as a Muslim. Malaysia's constitution guarantees freedom of religion, but by law, all ethnic Malays are Muslim. Joy converted to Christianity at age 26, and after some bureaucratic difficulties had her named legally changed in 1999. However, on her MyKad national ID, the National Registration Department retained her stated religion as Islam. In order to have her religion changed, the National Registration Department said Joy would have to obtain a certificate of apostasy from the Muslim Sharia Court.  Hypothesis: Lina Joy's parents are from Malaysia.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Lina Joy was "born Azlina Jailani to Malay parents" which implies that her parents are from Malaysia, as Malaysia is the country with a significant Malay population. This information directly supports the hypothesis that Lina Joy's parents are from Malaysia.
1760499015	1760499017	Premise: November 9, 1989 , the day the Berlin Wall fell and the world changed forever . Not even the most astute saw it coming . As Hungary's foreign minister in the late summer of 1989 , Gyula Horn gave the order to let visiting East Germans use his country to do a 400-mile end run around the Berlin Wall , a move now seen as the beginning of the end for hard-line communism in Europe .  Hypothesis: The Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "The Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989" does follow from the premise.   The premise states that the Berlin Wall fell on November 9, 1989, which directly implies that the wall was torn down. The phrase "the world changed forever" also suggests significant and profound change, which aligns with the idea that a major event occurred, such as the fall of the Berlin Wall.  Additionally, the premise highlights Gyula Horn's role in allowing East Germans to travel through Hungary to bypass the Berlin Wall, which is often cited as a key event leading to the wall's eventual collapse. Therefore, the premise sets the stage for the hypothesis and implies its truth.
1760499017	1760499020	Premise: Valero Energy Corp., on Monday, said it found "extensive" additional damage at its 250,000-barrel-per-day Port Arthur refinery.  Hypothesis: Valero Energy Corp. produces 250,000 barrels per day.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that Valero Energy Corp. found "extensive" additional damage at its 250,000-barrel-per-day Port Arthur refinery. The fact that the refinery has a capacity of 250,000 barrels per day does not imply that Valero Energy Corp. produces 250,000 barrels per day. The capacity refers to the refinery's maximum production rate, but it does not necessarily mean that the refinery is operating at that rate at the current time.  For example, the refinery might be shut down for maintenance, or it might be operating at a reduced capacity due to the damage mentioned in the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis is an unwarranted inference from the premise.
1760499020	1760499021	Premise: Oil prices fall back as Yukos oil threat lifted  Hypothesis: Oil prices rise.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that oil prices fall back as Yukos oil threat is lifted. This suggests that the threat of disruption or instability associated with Yukos (a Russian oil company) was affecting oil prices, and its removal has led to a decrease in oil prices.   The hypothesis states that oil prices rise. This contradicts the premise, which states that oil prices fall. There is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis. In fact, the two statements are directly opposite.
1760499021	1760499023	Premise: Brian Brohm, the Louisville quarterback, threw for 368 yards and five touchdowns as the Cardinals beat visiting Oregon State 63-27.  Hypothesis: The quarterback threw for 413 yards and three touchdowns, and then ran to the end zone two more times.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that Brian Brohm threw for 368 yards and five touchdowns, but the hypothesis states that he threw for 413 yards and three touchdowns. The two numbers of touchdowns are different (five vs. three), so the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.
1760499023	1760499025	Premise: Greg Page, a former heavyweight boxing champion who suffered a severe brain injury in a 2001 fight, has died at 50. His wife Patricia said the one-time WBA champion had died at his home in Kentucky, USA, of complications related to injuries he suffered in the fight. Page was in a coma for a week after the 9 March 2001 fight against Dale Crowe which was stopped in the 10th round. Patricia Page said he was "in a better place now" after announcing on Monday he had died overnight in his sleep.  Hypothesis: Greg Page was a WBA champion.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise states: "Greg Page, a former heavyweight boxing champion... had died at his home in Kentucky, USA, of complications related to injuries he suffered in the fight." The phrase "a former heavyweight boxing champion" indicates that Greg Page was indeed a heavyweight boxing champion at some point in his career. The specific title he held, WBA (World Boxing Association) champion, is mentioned later in the premise, but the initial statement of him being a former champion already implies that he held a title. Therefore, the hypothesis "Greg Page was a WBA champion" logically follows from the premise.
1760499025	1760499026	Premise: Sierra is likely to remain in jail at the Hillsborough County jail in her native Tampa until her next hearing on December 20, where she is being held without bail, which would prevent her attending the Washington event on Friday even if she still had permission to perform. Sierra has been in jail since the start of the month after an altercation with police officers outside a Tampa nightclub, which she had been ejected from. She is charged with disorderly intoxication and resisting arrest.  Hypothesis: Sierra once reached the finals of "American Idol".  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Sierra once reached the finals of 'American Idol'" does not follow from the premise. The premise provides information about Sierra's current situation, including her arrest, charges, and upcoming hearing, but it does not provide any information about her past experiences or achievements. The fact that she is being held in jail and has a history of being ejected from a nightclub does not necessarily indicate that she has participated in or reached the finals of "American Idol".
1760499026	1760499028	Premise: Since 1987, however, Brazil has taken steps to dramatically reduce the destruction, including stepped-up enforcement and the elimination of tax incentives that led to large-scale land clearing.  Hypothesis: In the early 1990s Brazil began to take action to save the rainforest.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Brazil took steps to reduce destruction since 1987, including stepped-up enforcement and the elimination of tax incentives. This implies that the actions were initiated in 1987 or later. The hypothesis, however, states that Brazil began to take action in the early 1990s. Since the early 1990s would be after 1987, the premise does not provide sufficient information to support the hypothesis.
1760499028	1760499031	Premise: FIFA has received 11 bids to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments, an international football competition contested by the men's national teams. The countries vying to host the tournament are Australia, England, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Qatar, Russia, South Korea and United States, who have individual bids and the joint bids are from Belgium-Netherlands and Spain-Portugal.  Select bids are for 2018 and 2022 tournaments and two bids are just for the 2022 tournament. Qatar and South Korea are vying just for the 2022 tournament. The two winning bids will be chosen on December 2010 by the 24-man executive committee of FIFA.  Said FIFA president Sepp Blatter: "We are very pleased about the fantastic level of interest in our flagship competition, with all initial bidders confirming their candidature."  Hypothesis: Sepp Blatter is the president of FIFA.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Sepp Blatter is the president of FIFA" follows from the premise.  The premise states, "FIFA has received 11 bids to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments, an international football competition contested by the men's national teams. The countries vying to host the tournament are...". The mention of "FIFA" and the context of the World Cup implies that the statement is referring to the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the governing body of international football. The premise also quotes Sepp Blatter, stating "We are very pleased about the fantastic level of interest in our flagship competition, with all initial bidders confirming their candidature." The use of the word "our" implies that Sepp Blatter is a part of FIFA and has authority within the organization, making him likely to be the president. Therefore, the hypothesis follows from the premise.
1760499031	1760499034	Premise: U.S. crude settled $1.32 lower at $42.83 a barrel.  Hypothesis: Crude the light American lowered to the closing 1.32 dollars, to 42.83 dollars the barrel.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does follow from the premise.   The premise states that "U.S. crude settled $1.32 lower at $42.83 a barrel." This implies that the price of U.S. crude oil decreased by $1.32, resulting in a new price of $42.83 per barrel.  The hypothesis "Crude the light American lowered to the closing 1.32 dollars, to 42.83 dollars the barrel" essentially repeats the information provided in the premise, albeit with slight variations in wording and phrasing. It correctly conveys the same idea: the price of U.S. crude oil decreased by $1.32, reaching a new price of $42.83 per barrel.  Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise.
1760499034	1760499035	Premise: WINNENDEN, Germany ―A teenage gunman killed 15 people, most of them female, on Wednesday in a rampage that began at a school near Stuttgart in southern Germany and ended in a nearby town, where he then killed himself after the police wounded him. The attack left Germany, which tightened tough gun controls after a similar attack at a school seven years ago, struggling to understand the carnage that had again befallen it, a country with relatively little violent crime. In 2002, a gunman killed 16 people before killing himself at a school in Erfurt, in eastern Germany.  Hypothesis: In 2002 near Stuttgart a boy shot 16 people.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that in 2002, a gunman killed 16 people before killing himself at a school in Erfurt, in eastern Germany. However, the hypothesis states that the incident occurred near Stuttgart in southern Germany. Since Stuttgart and Erfurt are two different locations, the hypothesis is inconsistent with the premise.
1760499035	1760499037	Premise: Many hopes are riding on the sale of Talisman's holdings in Palm Beach and Hendry counties, which Vice President Al Gore announced with much fanfare last year at the 50th anniversary of Everglades National Park.  Hypothesis: Everglades National Park is located in Florida.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise. The premise mentions "Palm Beach and Hendry counties" and Everglades National Park, and since the Everglades are located in southern Florida, it can be reasonably inferred that Everglades National Park is also located in Florida. The mention of specific counties in Florida further supports this inference.
1760499037	1760499041	Premise: Rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy and ultimately death. Early symptoms of rabies in humans are nonspecific, consisting of fever, headache, and general malaise.  Hypothesis: Rabies is fatal in humans.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Rabies is fatal in humans" does not strictly follow from the premise.   The premise states that the rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy and ultimately death. However, it does not explicitly state that rabies is always fatal. It only mentions that the virus causes encephalopathy and ultimately death, implying that death is a possible outcome, but not a certain one.  If we assume that the premise implies a causal relationship between the virus and death, then the hypothesis might seem to follow. However, the premise does not rule out the possibility of medical intervention or treatment that could prevent death. In fact, prompt medical treatment, such as post-exposure prophylaxis, can prevent rabies if administered promptly after exposure to the virus.  To strengthen the argument, we would need additional information, such as:  * The premise explicitly stating that rabies is always fatal in humans. * Information about the typical progression of the disease and the inevitability of death. * Evidence that medical treatment is ineffective against the virus.  Without this additional information, the hypothesis is not a logical consequence of the premise.
1760499041	1760499043	Premise: American tobacco companies were showing a profit most quarters due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products sold including food.  Hypothesis: PM often entered markets with both cigarettes and food.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis that "PM often entered markets with both cigarettes and food" does follow from the premise that "American tobacco companies were showing a profit most quarters due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products sold including food."  The premise implies that American tobacco companies were diversifying their products to include food, which suggests that they were expanding their product lines to include non-cigarette items. This implies that companies like PM (Philip Morris) would be among those diversifying, as they are a prominent American tobacco company.  The use of the word "including" in the premise suggests that the diversification into food products is a part of the broader strategy of the American tobacco companies, which implies that companies like PM would also be entering new markets with food products.   Therefore, the hypothesis follows logically from the premise.
1760499043	1760499045	Premise: The development of agriculture by early humans, roughly 10,000 years ago, was also harmful to many natural ecosystems as they were systematically destroyed and replaced with artificial versions.  Hypothesis: Humans existed 10,000 years ago.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that the development of agriculture by early humans, roughly 10,000 years ago, was also harmful to many natural ecosystems as they were systematically destroyed and replaced with artificial versions. This implies that early humans existed around that time period, as they are the ones who developed agriculture.  The use of "early humans" in the premise directly implies the existence of humans at that point in time, making the hypothesis that "Humans existed 10,000 years ago" a logical consequence of the premise.
1760499045	1760499047	Premise: The two young leaders of the coup, Pibul Songgram and Pridi Phanomyang, both educated in Europe and influenced by Western ideas, came to dominate Thai politics in the ensuing years.  Hypothesis: Pibul was a young leader.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Pibul Songgram was one of the two young leaders of the coup, but it does not necessarily imply that he was young. The word "young" could also refer to his leadership role, meaning that he was one of the newer leaders or a rising leader, rather than his physical age. The premise does not provide any information about Pibul's age, so the hypothesis that he was a young leader is an inference that cannot be logically deduced from the given information.
1760499047	1760499050	Premise: Lin Piao, after all, was the creator of Mao's "Little Red Book" of quotations.  Hypothesis: Lin Piao wrote the "Little Red Book".  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that Lin Piao was the creator of Mao's "Little Red Book" of quotations, but the hypothesis states that Lin Piao wrote the "Little Red Book". The two statements are not logically equivalent.  The premise implies that Lin Piao was responsible for creating the "Little Red Book", but it does not explicitly state that Lin Piao wrote the actual content of the book. In fact, the "Little Red Book" is a collection of quotations from Mao Zedong, and its content is primarily composed of Mao's writings and speeches.  Therefore, the hypothesis that Lin Piao wrote the "Little Red Book" is not a logical consequence of the premise.
1760499050	1760499053	Premise: When patients interrupt a course of antibiotics, the surviving bacteria return with a vengeance, often having rapidly mutated to resist the therapy.  Hypothesis: Bacteria is winning the war against antibiotics.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Bacteria is winning the war against antibiotics" does not directly follow from the premise.   The premise only states that when patients interrupt a course of antibiotics, the surviving bacteria return, having rapidly mutated to resist the therapy. This statement implies that bacteria can adapt and become resistant to antibiotics, but it does not necessarily imply that bacteria are winning a war.  A war typically involves a sustained and ongoing conflict between two opposing forces, with one side trying to defeat the other. The premise describes a specific scenario where bacteria adapt to antibiotics, but it does not suggest that bacteria are actively fighting against humans or the medical community in a broader, ongoing conflict.  A more accurate hypothesis based on the premise might be "Bacteria are developing resistance to antibiotics." This hypothesis directly follows from the premise, as it describes the observed phenomenon of bacteria adapting to antibiotics.
1760499053	1760499054	Premise: Initially the Bundesbank opposed the introduction of the euro but was compelled to accept it in light of the political pressure of the capitalist politicians who supported its introduction.  Hypothesis: The introduction of the euro has been opposed.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "The introduction of the euro has been opposed" does follow from the premise.   The premise states that the Bundesbank initially opposed the introduction of the euro and was only compelled to accept it due to political pressure. This implies that the Bundesbank had a negative stance towards the euro's introduction. Therefore, it logically follows that the introduction of the euro has been opposed, as the Bundesbank's opposition is a form of opposition.
1760499054	1760499056	Premise: The Armed Forces Press Committee (COPREFA) admitted that the government troops sustained 11 casualties in these clashes, adding that they inflicted three casualties on the rebels.  Hypothesis: Three rebels were killed by government troops.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Three rebels were killed by government troops" does not follow from the premise "The Armed Forces Press Committee (COPREFA) admitted that the government troops sustained 11 casualties in these clashes, adding that they inflicted three casualties on the rebels."  The premise states that government troops inflicted three casualties on the rebels, but it does not explicitly state that those casualties were deaths. It could be that the three casualties were wounded or injured, not killed. The phrase "inflicted three casualties" is a general term that could encompass both killed and wounded individuals.
1760499056	1760499058	Premise: One economic study will not be the basis of Canada's public policy decisions, but Easton's research does conclusively show that there are economic benefits in the legalization of marijuana.  Hypothesis: Drug legalization has benefits.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Easton's research conclusively shows that there are economic benefits in the legalization of marijuana. The hypothesis states that drug legalization has benefits.  The term "conclusively shows" in the premise implies a strong connection between the research and the conclusion that there are economic benefits. The use of "conclusively" suggests that the research has provided strong evidence or proof for this conclusion.  Therefore, since the premise establishes a clear connection between the research and the economic benefits of marijuana legalization, it logically follows that the hypothesis (drug legalization has benefits) is supported by the premise.
1760499058	1760499060	Premise: Archaeologists have found approximately 30 beautifully preserved mummies in a 4,000 year old Egyptian necropolis which held 53 tombs. Supervisor of Antiquities for Middle Egypt Dr. Abdel-Rahman El-Ayedi's team established his archaeological site in the Faiyum Oasis near the El-Lahun Egyptian pyramid which is just south of Cairo. Besides the mummies, the team found masks, amulets, clay pots and an offering table located in a funerary chapel. The chapel dates back to about 30 BC to 337 AD.  Hypothesis: 30 beautifully preserved mummies have been located in the south of Cairo.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does follow from the premise. The premise states that archaeologists have found approximately 30 beautifully preserved mummies in a 4,000-year-old Egyptian necropolis. The hypothesis states that 30 beautifully preserved mummies have been located in the south of Cairo. The location mentioned in the premise (near the El-Lahun Egyptian pyramid, south of Cairo) and the hypothesis (south of Cairo) are in close proximity, making the hypothesis a logical consequence of the premise.
1760499060	1760499063	Premise: Gastrointestinal bleeding can happen as an adverse effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin or ibuprofen.  Hypothesis: Aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding" does not follow from the premise "Gastrointestinal bleeding can happen as an adverse effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin or ibuprofen."  The premise only mentions that gastrointestinal bleeding is a possible side effect of these drugs, not that it is caused by them, and certainly not that aspirin prevents it. In fact, the premise suggests the opposite: that aspirin can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, as it is listed as one of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that can lead to this adverse effect.  To follow logically from the premise, a more reasonable hypothesis might be "Aspirin can cause gastrointestinal bleeding." This hypothesis is a more direct and logical conclusion based on the information provided.
1760499063	1760499065	Premise: A former employee of the company, David Vance of South Portland, said Hooper spent a lot of time on the road, often meeting with customers between Portland and Kittery.  Hypothesis: Hooper is a citizen of Portland.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise mentions that Hooper spent a lot of time on the road, often meeting with customers between Portland and Kittery, which implies that Hooper's work requires traveling between these two locations. However, it does not provide any information about Hooper's place of residence. Therefore, it is possible that Hooper lives in Kittery, or possibly another city between Portland and Kittery, such as South Portland (where David Vance lives). The hypothesis assumes Hooper's place of residence is Portland, which is not supported by the given information.
1760499065	1760499066	Premise: Cyprus, divided or not, joins the EU on the 1st of May.  Hypothesis: Cyprus was divided into two parts on May 1.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that Cyprus joins the EU on May 1, but it does not imply that the country is divided into two parts on that date. The two statements are independent and do not logically connect. The fact that Cyprus joins the EU on May 1 does not necessitate a division of the country.
1760499066	1760499068	Premise: World leaders expressed concern on Thursday that North Korea will quit six-party nuclear disarmament talks and will  bolster its nuclear weapons arsenal.  Hypothesis: North Korea says it has a stockpile of nuclear weapons and is building more.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis follows from the premise. The premise states that world leaders are concerned that North Korea will quit six-party nuclear disarmament talks and will bolster its nuclear weapons arsenal. This implies that North Korea's actions (quitting the talks and bolstering its nuclear arsenal) are likely to lead to the development of more nuclear weapons. Therefore, the hypothesis that North Korea says it has a stockpile of nuclear weapons and is building more can be logically inferred from the premise.
1760499068	1760499070	Premise: In addition to establishing the electoral commission, the laws also concern nationality, a contentious issue since citizenship laws were tightened to exclude one of Gbagbo's main competitors from the 2000 presidential race, former prime minister Alassane Ouattara.  Hypothesis: Gbagbo is a competitor of Ouattara.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that citizenship laws were tightened to exclude Ouattara from the 2000 presidential race, implying that Ouattara was initially eligible to run but was prevented from doing so due to changes in the citizenship laws. This suggests that Ouattara and Gbagbo were competitors in the 2000 presidential race, but the premise itself does not explicitly state that they are competitors.  However, the information in the premise implies that Ouattara was a competitor of Gbagbo, but it does not necessarily imply that Gbagbo was a competitor of Ouattara. The hypothesis states that Gbagbo is a competitor of Ouattara, but the premise only establishes Ouattara as a competitor of Gbagbo.
1760499070	1760499072	Premise: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace Prize, though he was nominated for it five times between 1937 and 1948.  Hypothesis: Mohandas received the Nobel Prize in 1989.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize five times between 1937 and 1948, but did not receive it. It does not provide any information about whether Gandhi received the Nobel Prize at any point after 1948. The hypothesis states that Gandhi received the Nobel Prize in 1989, which is outside the time frame mentioned in the premise.
1760499072	1760499075	Premise: The Christian Democrats (CDU) won 35.2% of the vote, or 225 seats, against 34.3% for Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats (SPD).  Hypothesis: It seems unlikely that there will be a coalition between Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats and Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does follow from the premise.   In the premise, it is stated that the Christian Democrats (CDU) won 35.2% of the vote, while the Social Democrats (SPD) won 34.3%. This indicates that the CDU received a slightly higher percentage of the vote.   Given that the CDU won more seats (225) than the SPD would have expected based on their percentage of the vote, it is plausible that the CDU would be in a stronger position to form a coalition government.   Since Angela Merkel is the leader of the CDU, it is likely that her party would be the dominant partner in any coalition government that forms. It is therefore unlikely that Gerhard Schroeder's SPD would be able to form a coalition with the CDU, as the CDU would be in a position of power and may not see the need to form a coalition with the SPD.
1760499075	1760499076	Premise: Edward VIII became King in January of 1936 and abdicated in December.  Hypothesis: King Edward VIII abdicated in December 1936.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does follow from the premise. The premise states that Edward VIII became King in January 1936 and abdicated in December 1936. This implies that the abdication occurred at the end of the year, which matches the hypothesis.
1760499076	1760499077	Premise: Australian Guantanamo Bay detainee David Hicks has won British citizenship, opening the door for a possible bid to have him freed from the US detention facility in Cuba. Justice Lawrence Collins of the British High Court has overturned the British Government's refusal of citizenship to Hicks, whose mother was born in England. Justice Collins said the Government had "no power to withhold or deprive citizenship". Justice Collins said: "In my view it would be improper to fail to give assistance which otherwise would have been given, simply because the claimant was believed to be involved in terrorism and has not had any previous connection with this country." Hicks' lawyer, Stephen Grosz, said the decision was a breakthrough. He said there was now no reason why Hicks should not enjoy the same protection as the nine other British citizens released without charge from Guantanamo Bay on representations of the British Government.  Hypothesis: Stephen Grosz is the British lawyer of David Hicks.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states: "Hicks' lawyer, Stephen Grosz, said the decision was a breakthrough."   This directly indicates that Stephen Grosz is David Hicks' lawyer.   Therefore, it logically follows that Stephen Grosz is the British lawyer of David Hicks.
1760499077	1760499079	Premise: Rockweed has been harvested commercially in Nova Scotia since the late 1950's and is currently the most important commercial seaweed in Atlantic Canada.  Hypothesis: Marine vegetation is  harvested.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise states that rockweed has been harvested commercially in Nova Scotia since the late 1950s and is the most important commercial seaweed in Atlantic Canada. This implies that rockweed is being removed or gathered from the ocean in some way, which aligns with the idea that marine vegetation (rockweed in this case) is being harvested.
1760499079	1760499080	Premise: Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has ordered security forces to take firm action against rioters following the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto. The violence has left at least 44 people dead and dozens injured. Mr. Musharraf insisted the measures were to protect people. VOA's Ayaz Gul reports from Islamabad that a bitter dispute has also erupted over how the 54-year-old politician died and who was behind her assassination.  Hypothesis: Musharraf has ordered rioters to take firm action against security forces.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that President Musharraf has ordered security forces to take firm action against rioters, implying that the security forces are the ones taking action. The hypothesis states that Musharraf has ordered rioters to take firm action against security forces, which is the opposite of the premise. This suggests a reversal of the roles, with the rioters being the ones taking action against the security forces. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.
1760499080	1760499084	Premise: A month after Gov. David A. Paterson dropped his proposal for a soda tax, New York City's health commissioner has written an article advocating "hefty" taxes on sodas and sports drinks containing sugar. Such a tax, the article said, could be the biggest boon to public health since tobacco taxes. The commissioner, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, and Kelly D. Brownell of Yale University, his co-author, argue in the New England Journal of Medicine that a tax of a penny per ounce could reduce consumption by more than 10 percent and raise $1.2 billion a year in New York State alone.  Hypothesis: Michael Bloomberg is the mayor of New York.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis that Michael Bloomberg is the mayor of New York does not follow from the premise.  The premise mentions that Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the health commissioner, wrote an article with Kelly D. Brownell of Yale University, advocating for a soda tax. While it is true that Michael Bloomberg was the mayor of New York City during this time period (2002-2013), there is no information in the premise that connects him directly to the article or the proposal. The premise focuses on the health commissioner's proposal, not on the mayor's stance.  However, it can be reasonably inferred that Michael Bloomberg was likely the mayor of New York City at the time of the proposal, given the timing (a month after Gov. David A. Paterson dropped his proposal) and the fact that Dr. Thomas R. Frieden was the health commissioner under Mayor Bloomberg's administration. But this inference is not a direct logical consequence of the premise, and the hypothesis does not strictly follow from it.
1760499084	1760499085	Premise: Officials said the Finnish suspect was among the dead but did not provide a motive for the attack.  Hypothesis: Officials said that the suspect, a Finnish citizen, was among the dead.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that the Finnish suspect was among the dead, implying that the suspect was killed. The hypothesis states that the suspect, a Finnish citizen, was among the dead, but it implies that the suspect is alive. The key difference lies in the implication of being alive or dead. The premise suggests that the suspect is dead, while the hypothesis suggests that the suspect is alive.
1760499085	1760499087	Premise: Britain agreed to lift by March 31 a 150-mile military protection zone enforced around the islands since Argentina invaded them in 1982.  Hypothesis: The military protection zone around Falklands was lifted.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "The military protection zone around Falklands was lifted" follows from the premise "Britain agreed to lift by March 31 a 150-mile military protection zone enforced around the islands since Argentina invaded them in 1982."   The premise states that Britain agreed to lift the zone, which implies an intention or a commitment to do so. The fact that it was agreed to be lifted by a specific date (March 31) further supports the idea that the action will take place. Therefore, the conclusion that the military protection zone was indeed lifted is a logical consequence of the premise.
1760499087	1760499090	Premise: The ferry owner PT Nur Budi's spokesman blamed Indonesian port authorities for the tragedy. "The passenger capacity of the ferry is 205 people but the port administrator accepted more passengers as they thought it was possible," he said. The National Meteorological and Geophysics Agency, however, had published and raised an alert signal about high waves on Friday. It specifically stated that "Saturday 10th and Sunday 11th, Indonesian waters would have witnessed storm force waves," but despite the dire warnings KM Teratai set for the seas.  Hypothesis: An Indonesian ferry with 300 passengers sank.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise provides information about the following:  1. The ferry's passenger capacity is 205 people. 2. The port administrator accepted more passengers, which implies that the actual number of passengers exceeded the ferry's capacity. 3. The National Meteorological and Geophysics Agency issued a warning about high waves, specifically mentioning storm force waves for the days when the ferry set sail. 4. The ferry set sail despite the warning.  From this information, it can be inferred that the ferry was overloaded and sailed into a storm, which increases the likelihood of an accident occurring. The hypothesis that the ferry sank with 300 passengers is consistent with these facts.
1760499090	1760499091	Premise: Tension and battles between Greek police and anarchist demonstrators took place in the centre of Athens, Greece, during the anti-war demonstration of the 4th European Social Forum which is taking place in the Greek capital, from 4 to 7 of May 2006. The march of the approximately 1,000 anarchists ended with clashes between groups of anarchists and police. Riot police used tear gas, while a branch of a Greek bank, a fast-food store and around 50 shop windows in central Athens were damaged.  Hypothesis: The riots in Greece started on December 6.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "The riots in Greece started on December 6" does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that the events occurred during the anti-war demonstration of the 4th European Social Forum in Athens, Greece, from May 4 to 7, 2006. This information directly contradicts the hypothesis, which suggests that the riots started on December 6, which is outside the specified date range (May 4-7) mentioned in the premise.
1760499091	1760499093	Premise: Libya's case against Britain and the US concerns the dispute over their demand for extradition of Libyans charged with blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in 1988.  Hypothesis: One case involved the extradition of Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise. The premise mentions that Libya's case concerns the dispute over the extradition of Libyans charged with blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in 1988. The hypothesis, "One case involved the extradition of Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing," directly relates to this specific aspect of the premise, which mentions the extradition of Libyans in connection with the Lockerbie bombing.
1760499093	1760499095	Premise: Argentina sought help from Britain on its privatization program and encouraged British investment.  Hypothesis: Argentina sought UK expertise on privatization and agriculture.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does follow from the premise.   The premise states that Argentina sought help from Britain on its privatization program and encouraged British investment. This implies that Argentina was looking for assistance or guidance from Britain on how to privatize certain sectors or industries. The hypothesis that Argentina sought UK expertise on privatization is a specific example of the help they sought, as privatization is a key area where expertise would be valuable.   Additionally, the premise also mentions that Argentina encouraged British investment, which suggests that they were looking for involvement from British businesses. The hypothesis that they sought UK expertise on agriculture is also supported by the premise, as agriculture is a common area where investment and expertise from other countries can be beneficial.
1760499095	1760499097	Premise: Instead of action on crime, we got the federal long gun registry, which became a bloated bureaucratic nightmare to responsible hunters, farmers and rural Canadians. It cost taxpayers some CA$2 billion and it hasn't done a thing to reduce gun crime. said Harper. The Conservatives have provided amnesty for unregistered gun owners. At this time there is no legislation set before the House of Commons. Conservative Garry Breitkreuz from Saskatchewan tabled the bill killing the long-gun registry.  Hypothesis: Garry Breitkreuz is a member of the Conservative Party.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Garry Breitkreuz is a member of the Conservative Party" does follow from the premise.  The premise mentions that the "Conservatives have provided amnesty for unregistered gun owners" and that "Conservative Garry Breitkreuz from Saskatchewan tabled the bill killing the long-gun registry." This implies that Garry Breitkreuz is a member of the Conservative Party, as the text explicitly states "Conservative Garry Breitkreuz."
1760499097	1760499099	Premise: The researchers in the latest study fed one group of mice a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat. The diet started when the mice, all males, were 1 year old, which is middle-age in mouse longevity. As expected, the mice soon developed signs of impending diabetes, with grossly enlarged livers, and started to die much sooner than mice fed a standard diet.  Hypothesis: At the age of one year, male mice were fed with a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that the researchers fed one group of mice a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat and that the mice developed signs of impending diabetes and died sooner than mice fed a standard diet. The hypothesis, however, states that the mice were fed this diet at the age of one year.   The premise only mentions that the diet started when the mice were 1 year old, which is middle-age in mouse longevity. It does not state that the diet was the cause of the mice developing signs of impending diabetes and dying sooner. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.
1760499099	1760499102	Premise: The soldiers, who were said to have been wearing Arab headdress, were accused of firing at Iraqi police when stopped at a road block.  Hypothesis: The soldiers were driving a civilian car and were dressed in civilian clothes when a shooting took place between them and Iraqi patrols.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the premise.   The premise states that the soldiers were wearing Arab headdress and fired at Iraqi police when stopped at a roadblock. The hypothesis, however, states that the soldiers were driving a civilian car and were dressed in civilian clothes.   There is no information provided in the premise that suggests the soldiers were not wearing civilian clothes or driving a civilian car. In fact, the premise only mentions that they were wearing Arab headdress, which could imply that they were dressed in civilian attire, but it does not provide enough information to rule out the possibility that they were wearing civilian clothes.  A more logical hypothesis that follows from the premise would be: "The soldiers were wearing Arab headdress when they fired at Iraqi police at a roadblock." This hypothesis directly follows from the premise as it only adds more detail to the information provided.
1760499102	1760499105	Premise: The United States would like to see U.N. weapons inspectors return to Iraq providing the Iraqis take concrete, affirmative and demonstrable actions "to show full co-operation" Clinton said.  Hypothesis: U.N. weapons inspectors could stay in Iraq, Clinton said.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise states that the U.S. wants U.N. weapons inspectors to return to Iraq if the Iraqis take concrete, affirmative, and demonstrable actions to show full cooperation. The hypothesis states that U.N. weapons inspectors could stay in Iraq, which implies that the Iraqis are taking the required actions, or at least, the possibility of them doing so.  The connection between the premise and the hypothesis is that if the Iraqis cooperate, the U.N. inspectors can return and stay in Iraq, as per the U.S. condition. Therefore, the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise.
1760499105	1760499107	Premise: On 12 August, the San Carlos Battalion came across mines placed in their path and one soldier was killed while two were seriously injured. Meanwhile on 10 August, urban commandos took a patrol car by surprise and dropped a grenade inside the car, injuring four and partially destroying the vehicle.  Hypothesis: A patrol car was attacked by the San Carlos Battalion.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that the San Carlos Battalion came across mines and one soldier was killed, and also mentions that urban commandos took a patrol car by surprise and dropped a grenade inside it. There is no indication that the San Carlos Battalion was involved in the attack on the patrol car. The two events are presented as separate incidents, one involving the San Carlos Battalion and mines, and the other involving urban commandos and a patrol car.   The hypothesis that a patrol car was attacked by the San Carlos Battalion is an inference that goes beyond the information provided in the premise. It requires additional information to establish a connection between the San Carlos Battalion and the attack on the patrol car.
1760499107	1760499110	Premise: Bomb-sniffing dogs were brought to Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment.  Hypothesis: Bomb-sniffing dogs were estimated at Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that bomb-sniffing dogs were brought to Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment. This implies that the dogs were present at the apartment, and their purpose was likely to search for bombs.  The hypothesis states that bomb-sniffing dogs were estimated at Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment. This statement is consistent with the premise, as it also mentions the presence of bomb-sniffing dogs at the apartment. The word "estimated" might imply that the number or presence of the dogs was confirmed or inferred through observation or investigation, but it doesn't contradict the premise.  In logic, the hypothesis follows from the premise because it doesn't add any new information that contradicts the original statement. It's a logical consequence of the initial statement.
1760499110	1760499112	Premise: Startling new research into mobile phones claims they may reduce a man's sperm count by up to 30%.  Hypothesis: Male fertility may be affected by use of a mobile phones.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise provides a claim about the potential impact of mobile phones on male fertility, specifically a reduction in sperm count by up to 30%. This claim directly suggests that there is a correlation between mobile phone use and male fertility. The hypothesis, therefore, logically follows as it is a specific example or interpretation of this correlation, stating that male fertility may be affected by the use of mobile phones.   This is an example of a deductive reasoning process, where the premise provides a general statement, and the hypothesis is a specific instance of that general statement.
1760499112	1760499115	Premise: Workers at the Lufthansa Technik Automotive plant in Co Dublin are due to vote today on changes to work practices being sought by the company's management. The aircraft engine maintenace firm has warned that rejection of the proposals would threaten a planned €17230m investment in the Rathcoole plant and put jobs at risk. LTA says it is not seeking any lay-offs or pay cuts and the planned investment would guarantee the future of the plant for the next 15 years. The work-practice changes are being sought following the collapse of Labour Relations Commission talks on the matter.  Hypothesis: Lufthansa Technik Automotive fires 30 workers.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Lufthansa Technik Automotive has warned that rejection of the proposals would threaten a planned €17.23m investment in the Rathcoole plant and put jobs at risk. This suggests that if the proposals are rejected, there might be job losses, but it does not necessarily mean that the company will fire 30 workers specifically. The premise does not provide a specific number of jobs at risk or a specific action that the company will take.  The premise also states that LTA says it is not seeking any lay-offs or pay cuts, which suggests that the company is trying to avoid job losses. The hypothesis contradicts this statement, implying that the company will fire 30 workers if the proposals are rejected.   Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.
1760499115	1760499117	Premise: It rewrites the rules of global trade, established by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, in 1947, and modified in multiple rounds of negotiations since then.  Hypothesis: GATT was formed in 1947.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "GATT was formed in 1947" follows from the premise.   The premise states that GATT was formed in 1947 and modified in multiple rounds of negotiations since then. This implies that GATT already existed in 1947, and the phrase "was formed" suggests a point of origin. The premise provides a specific year (1947) as the starting point, supporting the hypothesis that GATT was indeed formed in that year.
1760499117	1760499118	Premise: Vice President Dick Cheney on Tuesday hurled an obscenity on the Senate floor to punctuate an angry exchange with Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy as all senators gathered for their annual photo.  Hypothesis: Cheney cursed at Sen. Patrick Leahy.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis follows from the premise. The premise states that Vice President Dick Cheney "hurled an obscenity" during an exchange with Sen. Patrick Leahy, which implies that he used an insult or profanity. The hypothesis that Cheney cursed at Sen. Leahy is a direct consequence of this action.
1760499118	1760499119	Premise: In the May 2005 general election Michael Howard failed to unseat the Labour Government, although the Conservatives did gain 33 seats, playing the most significant role in reducing Labour's majority from 167 to 66.  Hypothesis: In the May 2005 general election Conservatives got 33 seats.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis follows from the premise. The premise states that in the May 2005 general election, the Conservatives gained 33 seats and played a significant role in reducing Labour's majority from 167 to 66. This directly implies that the Conservatives gained 33 seats, which is the hypothesis.
1760499119	1760499120	Premise: The Norwegian Newspaper Corpus is a large and self-expanding corpus of Norwegian newspaper texts. The collection of this dynamic and continually growing corpus began in 1998.  Hypothesis: Dagbladet is a Norwegian newspaper.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise states that the Norwegian Newspaper Corpus is a collection of Norwegian newspaper texts that began in 1998. Dagbladet is a Norwegian newspaper, so it is a type of text that would be included in the Norwegian Newspaper Corpus. Therefore, if the premise is true, then it logically follows that Dagbladet is a Norwegian newspaper, which is stated in the hypothesis.
1760499120	1760499123	Premise: The Dutch, who ruled Indonesia until 1949, called the city of Jakarta Batavia.  Hypothesis: Formerly ( until 1949 ) Batavia, Jakarta is largest city and capital of Indonesia.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does follow from the premise.   The premise states that the Dutch, who ruled Indonesia until 1949, called the city of Jakarta Batavia. This implies that Jakarta was known as Batavia during the Dutch colonial period.  The hypothesis states that Jakarta, formerly (until 1949) known as Batavia, is the largest city and capital of Indonesia. This conclusion logically follows from the premise, as it is established that Jakarta was known as Batavia during the Dutch colonial period, which ended in 1949. Therefore, it can be inferred that Jakarta was indeed the capital of Indonesia, and it is the largest city, as it has retained its status as the capital since the end of Dutch rule.
1760499123	1760499124	Premise: The name for the newest James Bond film has been announced today. The 22nd film, previously known only as "Bond 22", will be called "Quantum of Solace". EON Productions who are producing the film made the announcement today at Pinewood Studios, where production for the film has been under way since last year. The name of the film was inspired by a short story (of the same name) from For Your Eyes Only by Bond creator, Ian Fleming.  Hypothesis: James Bond was created by Ian Fleming.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "James Bond was created by Ian Fleming" is indeed supported by the premise.  The premise mentions that the name of the film, "Quantum of Solace", was inspired by a short story of the same name from "For Your Eyes Only" by Bond creator, Ian Fleming. This implies that Ian Fleming is the creator of the character and the stories associated with him, including James Bond.   This information directly supports the hypothesis, making it a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the premise.
1760499124	1760499126	Premise: The gastric bypass operation, also known as stomach stapling, has become the most common surgical procedure for treating obesity.  Hypothesis: Obesity is medically treated.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does follow from the premise.   The premise states that the gastric bypass operation, also known as stomach stapling, has become the most common surgical procedure for treating obesity. This implies that obesity is being treated medically through surgery. The hypothesis, "Obesity is medically treated," is a direct consequence of this premise, as it states that obesity is being treated through a medical intervention (surgery).
1760499126	1760499127	Premise: The cost of the consumer of the United States fell in June.  Hypothesis: U.S. consumer spending dived in June.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does follow from the premise. If the cost of the consumer fell in June, it implies that consumers had to spend less money to maintain their standard of living or to purchase the same goods and services. This decrease in expenditure is a direct consequence of the decrease in cost, as consumers would not spend more if prices are lower.
1760499127	1760499128	Premise: The former leader of Iraq was rushed to hospital last Sunday after refusing to eat for sixteen days. But according to news agencies, he has ended the hunger strike by eating lunch at the court in Baghdad. "Saddam ate beef and rice and cola with bread which he brought from hospital," one source told Reuters news agency. He was fasting with three co-defendants, and they were demanding more security for their defence lawyers, three of whom have been murdered.  Hypothesis: Some Australians have fasted to protest.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise is about Saddam Hussein's hunger strike in Iraq, and there is no information provided that links to Australians fasting in protest. The two pieces of information are unrelated, and the premise does not provide any evidence or context that suggests Australians have fasted to protest.
1760499128	1760499130	Premise: Sonia Gandhi can be defeated in the next elections in India by BJP.  Hypothesis: Sonia Gandhi is defeated by BJP.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise states that Sonia Gandhi can be defeated in the next elections in India by BJP. This implies that there is a possibility or a potential for her to be defeated by BJP.   The hypothesis states that Sonia Gandhi is defeated by BJP, which is a specific instance of the possibility mentioned in the premise. Therefore, it logically follows from the premise that Sonia Gandhi being defeated by BJP is a possible outcome, and in this context, it is a specific instance of that possibility.
1760499130	1760499132	Premise: Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has said that Mahmoud Abbas is a man that Israel can do business with.  Hypothesis: Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, may be someone Israel can talk with.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise states that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has said that Mahmoud Abbas is someone that Israel can do business with. This statement directly implies that Abbas is a person with whom Israel can have some form of interaction or negotiation, which is the same idea presented in the hypothesis. The hypothesis is simply a rephrasing of the premise in a slightly different way, indicating that the hypothesis logically follows from the premise.
1760499132	1760499133	Premise: The Tempe Hometown Premiere will have all the trappings of a mega-Hollywood  event including red carpet arrivals, klieg lights, screaming fans, paparazzi and  media coverage of the film`s stars headed by Wolverine himself, Hugh Jackman and  including Liev Schreiber, Ryan Reynolds, Taylor Kitsch, Lynn Collins, will.i.am  and director Gavin Hood.  Following a hard-fought contest stretching over thousands of cities and towns  across the United States, Tempe emerged triumphant in a far-reaching, citywide  bid to nab the gala event. Mayor Hugh Hallman himself rallied the community,  which stepped up with dozens of videos that were posted on YouTube.  Hypothesis: Hugh Jackman plays the role of Wolverine in the movie.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise mentions that "Wolverine himself, Hugh Jackman" will be attending the event, which directly implies that Hugh Jackman plays the role of Wolverine in the movie. This connection between Hugh Jackman and the character of Wolverine is the key to the hypothesis.
1760499133	1760499135	Premise: In October, however, amid rising tensions between the government and opposition groups, a car bomb seriously injured an opposition politician and killed his driver, in Beirut.  Hypothesis: A member of the opposition was injured in a car bomb attack in Beirut.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise states: "In October, however, amid rising tensions between the government and opposition groups, a car bomb seriously injured an opposition politician and killed his driver, in Beirut."  The hypothesis states: "A member of the opposition was injured in a car bomb attack in Beirut."  The premise directly supports the hypothesis by mentioning that an opposition politician (a member of the opposition) was seriously injured in a car bomb attack in Beirut. The hypothesis is a specific instance of the information provided in the premise.
1760499135	1760499137	Premise: Weinstock painstakingly reviewed dozens of studies for evidence of any link between sunscreen use and either an increase or decrease in melanoma.  Hypothesis: skin cancer numbers increase.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Weinstock reviewed dozens of studies and implies that the results of these studies are being examined for evidence of a link between sunscreen use and melanoma. The premise does not state that the studies found a link, nor does it state that the link is positive (i.e., that sunscreen use increases melanoma) or negative (i.e., that sunscreen use decreases melanoma).   The hypothesis, which states that skin cancer numbers increase, is a specific prediction about the outcome of the research. The premise does not provide enough information to support this hypothesis. To determine whether the hypothesis follows from the premise, we would need to know the results of Weinstock's review of the studies, which is not provided in the premise.
1760499137	1760499140	Premise: Most people are familiar with the idea of St. Bernards or other dogs taking part in rescue and recovery efforts. Robots might also take part in search and rescue missions.  Hypothesis: Robots are used to find missing victims.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Robots are used to find missing victims" does follow from the premise "Most people are familiar with the idea of St. Bernards or other dogs taking part in rescue and recovery efforts."  The premise implies that animals (in this case, dogs) are used in rescue and recovery efforts, and it can be logically inferred that robots, which are also machines that can be used for various tasks, could also be used in similar rescue and recovery efforts. This inference is based on the idea of expanding the concept of using animals for rescue work to include other machines that can perform similar functions, such as navigating challenging terrain or detecting signs of life.  Therefore, the hypothesis is a plausible extension of the premise, and it is reasonable to conclude that robots could be used to find missing victims in rescue and recovery efforts.
1760499140	1760499142	Premise: Illinois born Charlton Heston was a 27-year-old actor from Broadway and television when he arrived in Hollywood for a five-picture contract with Hal Wallis.  Hypothesis: Charlton Heston was born in Illinois.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does follow from the premise. The premise states that Charlton Heston was an Illinois-born actor, and this is directly stated as a fact about him. The information about his age, Broadway and television experience, and the contract with Hal Wallis is additional context, but the fact that he was born in Illinois is presented as a given. Therefore, the hypothesis is supported by the premise.
1760499142	1760499144	Premise: Ruth's 1927 single season record of 60 home runs stood unsurpassed until Roger Maris hit 61 in 1961.  Hypothesis: Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs in his lifetime.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Ruth's 1927 single season record of 60 home runs stood unsurpassed until Roger Maris hit 61 in 1961. This means that in 1927, Ruth hit 60 home runs in one season. It does not imply that he hit 60 home runs in his entire lifetime.   In fact, the premise actually contradicts the hypothesis, because it specifically states that Ruth's 60 home runs in 1927 was a single-season record, implying that he did not hit 60 home runs in every season of his career.
1760499144	1760499147	Premise: The German technology was employed to build Shanghai's existing maglev line, the first in the world to be used commercially.  Hypothesis: Maglev is commercially used.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Maglev is commercially used" does not necessarily follow from the premise "The German technology was employed to build Shanghai's existing maglev line, the first in the world to be used commercially."  The premise provides information about the origin of the technology used in the Shanghai maglev line, but it does not provide any information about whether the maglev technology is being used commercially in other places. The fact that the Shanghai maglev line was the first in the world to be used commercially does not imply that it is the only one in commercial use.  To support the hypothesis, we would need additional information, such as the current status of the Shanghai maglev line, its operating schedule, and whether other maglev lines exist and are in commercial use. Without this additional information, the hypothesis cannot be logically deduced from the premise.
1760499147	1760499148	Premise: SEATTLE — United Nations gang leader Clay Roueche should spend at least 30 years behind bars after his surprise guilty plea here Tuesday for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine, marijuana and illicit drug profits, U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Sullivan said. Sullivan said outside court that Roueche's leadership of the violent UN gang and the sophistication of the international drug conspiracy will all be factors used to argue for a longer sentence — up to life — for the 33-year-old Canadian. And he stressed that the plea agreement reached with Roueche did not include "any kind of break with respect to sentencing.".  Hypothesis: Clay Roueche is 33 years old.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Clay Roueche is 33 years old" follows from the premise. The premise states, "United Nations gang leader Clay Roueche... is a 33-year-old Canadian." This statement directly mentions Roueche's age, making it a fact that can be inferred from the premise.
1760499148	1760499149	Premise: Baker's voice will replace the earlier computer-synthesized voice that was previously used. BT said that his voice was chosen as it was instantly recognisable. It took him 11 days to record 11,593 phrases and sounds which could then be broken down and reassembled by a computer to make new words. It then took five months to process these recordings to make a workable service. BT have said that there will be no barriers as to what Tom Baker's voice can 'say', including rude words. "What appeals to me most is the thought that I will be bringing good news to people whether it is a cheeky message, a birthday greeting, or just a quick hello," said Baker.  Hypothesis: Tom Baker works for BT.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Tom Baker works for BT" does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Tom Baker's voice is being used by BT, but it does not imply that he is an employee of the company. He may have been hired as a voice actor or provided his voice for a specific project, but there is no information to suggest a direct employment relationship.
1760499149	1760499151	Premise: The Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for the selection of the candidates and the choice of Prize Winners for the Peace Prize. The Committee is composed of five members appointed by the Storting (Norwegian parliament). The Peace Prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway and not in Stockholm, Sweden like the other Nobel Prizes.  Hypothesis: Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that the Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for the selection of the candidates and the choice of Prize Winners for the Peace Prize. This implies that the Committee has the authority and the process in place to choose candidates, which is a necessary condition for candidates to be selected.  Therefore, it logically follows that Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen, as the premise provides the foundation for the selection process to occur.
1760499151	1760499153	Premise: More than 150 dolphins, marine turtles and beaked whales have been washed up dead on beaches in Africa.  Hypothesis: Dead dolphins, turtles and whales have been found on African beaches.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Dead dolphins, turtles and whales have been found on African beaches" follows from the premise "More than 150 dolphins, marine turtles and beaked whales have been washed up dead on beaches in Africa."  The premise explicitly states that the dead animals have been found on beaches in Africa, which directly supports the hypothesis. The hypothesis is a restatement of the premise with a slight rewording of the details, but it still conveys the same information. Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise.
