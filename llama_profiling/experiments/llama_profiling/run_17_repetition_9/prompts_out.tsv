1760564533	1760564534	"Mark told Pete many lies about himself, which Pete included in his book. He should have been more skeptical.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Mark""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""He"" refers to ""Mark"".   In this sentence, ""He"" is a pronoun that takes the place of a noun. Since the subject of the sentence is ""Mark"", ""He"" is used to refer to Mark in the subordinate clause ""He should have been more skeptical."" This is an example of a pronoun referring back to a noun in the previous clause for clarity and brevity."	86	
1760564534	1760564536	"The mothers of Arthur and Celeste have come to the town to fetch them. They are very happy to have them back, but they scold them just the same because they ran away.  In the sentence above, does ""them"" refer to ""mothers""? Explain your choice."	"In the given sentence, ""them"" refers to ""Arthur and Celeste.""   This is because the sentence structure is a subject-verb-object (SVO) pattern, with ""the mothers"" as the subject performing the action of fetching, ""Arthur and Celeste"" as the object being fetched, and ""them"" as a pronoun replacing ""Arthur and Celeste"" in the second part of the sentence. This is an example of an object pronoun, which is used to refer to a noun or a group of nouns previously mentioned."	111	
1760564536	1760564538	"Mark was close to Mr. Singer 's heels. He heard him calling for the captain, promising him, in the jargon everyone talked that night, that not one thing should be damaged on the ship except only the ammunition, but the captain and all his crew had best stay in the cabin until the work was over  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Mr. Singer""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""He"" refers to ""Mark"".   The reason for this is that the sentence is structured as: ""Mark was close to Mr. Singer's heels... He heard him calling for the captain...""   Here, ""Mark"" is the subject of the first clause (""Mark was close to Mr. Singer's heels""), and ""he"" is a pronoun referring back to the subject of the first clause, which is ""Mark"". The sentence then continues with ""him"", which refers to ""Mr. Singer"", indicating that Mr. Singer is the one doing the calling."	120	
1760564538	1760564541	"The pony behaved well, sir, and showed no vice; but at last he just threw up his heels and tipped the young gentleman into the thorn hedge. He wanted me to help him out, but I hope you will excuse me, sir, I did not feel inclined to do so.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""young gentleman""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""He"" refers to the pony.   This is because the sentence is structured as follows:   - ""The pony behaved well, sir, and showed no vice;"" (subject: the pony) - ""and at last he just threw up his heels and tipped the young gentleman into the thorn hedge."" (Here, ""he"" is a pronoun that refers back to the subject of the previous clause, which is the pony. The pony is the one performing the action of throwing up its heels and tipping the young gentleman into the thorn hedge.)  This use of ""he"" is an example of anaphora, where a pronoun is used to refer back to a previously mentioned subject."	147	
1760564541	1760564543	"I poured water from the bottle into the cup until it was full.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""the cup""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""it"" refers to ""the cup."" This is an example of a pronoun reference, specifically an anaphoric pronoun. The pronoun ""it"" is used to refer back to a previously mentioned noun, in this case, ""the cup."" This type of pronoun reference is called an anaphora.  The reasoning behind this is based on the context of the sentence. Since the action of pouring water is being performed onto the cup, and the cup is the recipient of the action, it is logical to assume that ""it"" refers to the cup."	119	
1760564543	1760564544	"Dan had to stop Bill from toying with the injured bird. He is very compassionate.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Dan""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""He"" refers to ""Dan"". The sentence structure suggests that Dan is the subject performing the action of stopping Bill from toying with the injured bird. The pronoun ""He"" is used to refer back to Dan, indicating that Dan is the one who took the action."	59	
1760564544	1760564545	"Sam Goodman 's biography of the Spartan general Xenophanes conveys a vivid sense of the difficulties he faced in his childhood.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Goodman""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""he"" does not refer to ""Goodman."" The pronoun ""he"" refers to ""Xenophanes.""   In the sentence, ""Sam Goodman"" is the subject performing an action (conveying a sense), and ""Xenophanes"" is the subject being described, specifically in his childhood."	68	
1760564545	1760564547	"Pam's parents came home and found her having sex with her boyfriend, Paul. They were furious about it.  In the sentence above, does ""They"" refer to ""Pam's parents""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""They"" refers to Pam's parents. This is because the pronoun ""They"" is used as the subject of the verb ""were"" in the phrase ""They were furious about it."" The subject of a sentence is typically the noun or pronoun that performs the action described by the verb. In this case, Pam's parents are the ones who are performing the action of being furious, so ""They"" must refer to them."	93	
1760564547	1760564548	"Bob paid for Charlie 's college education, but now Charlie acts as though it never happened. He is very hurt.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Bob""?

1760564548	1760564549	"Billy cried because Toby wouldn't share his toy.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Toby""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""his"" refers to ""Toby.""   The reason is that ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, indicating that the toy belongs to Toby. In the sentence, ""Billy cried because Toby wouldn't share his toy,"" ""his"" is used to show that the toy is Toby's possession, so it is referring back to Toby as the owner of the toy."	79	
1760564549	1760564551	"Emma did not pass the ball to Janie although she was open.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Janie""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence ""Emma did not pass the ball to Janie although she was open,"" ""she"" refers to ""Janie.""   This is because ""she"" is used as a pronoun to replace the subject ""Janie"" in the subordinate clause ""although she was open."" The sentence structure is:  - Emma (subject of the main clause) did not pass the ball to Janie. - Although (subordinating conjunction introducing the subordinate clause) she (referring to Janie) was open (predicate of the subordinate clause).  In this context, ""she"" is a pronoun used to refer back to Janie, indicating that Janie was the one who was open."	143	
1760564551	1760564553	"Sam's drawing was hung just above Tina's and it did look much better with another one below it.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""Sam's drawing""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""it"" is likely referring to ""Sam's drawing"".   The reason for this is that the sentence mentions ""Sam's drawing"" and then describes an improvement to it by adding another drawing below it. The pronoun ""it"" is used to refer back to the subject of the sentence, which is ""Sam's drawing"".   The use of ""it"" creates a clear connection between the initial subject (Sam's drawing) and the action being described (looking better with another drawing below it)."	105	
1760564553	1760564554	"Bob paid for Charlie 's college education, but now Charlie acts as though it never happened. He is very ungrateful.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Bob""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""He"" refers to ""Bob"". This is because the pronoun ""He"" is used as a subject pronoun, referring back to the subject of the sentence, which is ""Bob"". In this context, ""He"" is a third-person singular pronoun that replaces the subject ""Bob"" to avoid repetition and improve sentence flow."	71	1.0
1760564554	1760564556	"The lawyer asked the witness a question, but he was reluctant to answer it.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""the lawyer""? Explain your choice."	"In the given sentence, ""he"" refers to the witness.   This is because the sentence structure is in the form of ""SVO"" (Subject-Verb-Object), where ""the witness"" is the subject, ""asked"" is the verb, and ""the lawyer"" is the object. In this context, the pronoun ""he"" is a subject pronoun, and it refers back to the subject, which is ""the witness""."	93	
1760564556	1760564558	"Sam took French classes from Adam , because he was eager to speak it fluently.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Sam""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""he"" refers to ""Sam"".   This is because the subject-verb agreement rule is being applied. In the sentence, the subject ""Sam"" is a singular noun, and the verb ""took"" is in the third person singular form, agreeing with the subject ""Sam"". The pronoun ""he"" is also a third person singular pronoun, which matches the verb ""took"" in number and person, making it grammatically correct to refer to ""Sam"" with the pronoun ""he""."	105	
1760564558	1760564560	"Sid explained his theory to Mark but he couldn't convince him.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Mark""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""he"" refers to ""Mark"" in this sentence. The pronoun ""he"" is a third-person singular pronoun, which is used to refer to a male subject. In this case, the subject of the sentence is ""Sid"", but the verb ""explained"" is in the passive voice, and ""he"" is used as the subject of the passive voice, referring back to the original subject ""Sid"". However, in this specific sentence, the context implies that ""he"" is actually referring to ""Mark"", the person who was not convinced by Sid's theory."	119	
1760564560	1760564561	"The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence.  In the sentence above, does ""they"" refer to ""The demonstrators""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""they"" in the sentence refers to ""the demonstrators.""   This is an example of a pronoun reference, where a pronoun (in this case, ""they"") is used to replace a noun (in this case, ""the demonstrators""). The pronoun ""they"" is referring back to the subject of the sentence, which is the group that was refused a permit."	79	
1760564561	1760564562	"When Tommy dropped his ice cream, Timmy giggled, so father gave him a sympathetic look.  In the sentence above, does ""him"" refer to ""Timmy""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence above, ""him"" actually refers to ""Tommy.""   The reason is that the sentence is describing the action of ""father giving a sympathetic look,"" and the object of that action is ""him,"" which is implied to be the person who dropped the ice cream, which is ""Tommy."""	64	0.8
1760564562	1760564565	"After I saw Bill catching flies and pulling off their wings, I boxed his ears. I showed the master the flies, some crushed and some crawling about helpless, and I showed him the wings on the window sill. I never saw him so angry before; but as Bill was still howling and whining, like the coward that he was, he did not give him any more punishment of that kind, but set him up on a stool for the rest of the afternoon, and said that he should not go out to play for that week.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""the master""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""he"" refers to ""Bill.""   The reasoning behind this is based on the context and the pronoun's antecedent. ""He"" is used as a pronoun to refer back to a male subject, in this case, Bill. This is clear when we look at the previous sentences: ""Bill catching flies and pulling off their wings"" and ""Bill was still howling and whining, like the coward that he was."" The use of ""he"" in these sentences directly refers to Bill.   In the sentence ""I showed the master the flies... and he said that he should not go out to play for that week,"" ""he"" is used again, but this time it refers to ""the master"" because it is the subject that the sentence is describing, who is speaking and giving the punishment to Bill."	173	
1760564565	1760564568	"The journalists interviewed the stars of the new movie. They were very cooperative, so the interview lasted for a long time.  In the sentence above, does ""They"" refer to ""The journalists""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""They"" refers to ""The journalists"". This is an example of a pronoun reference, where the pronoun ""They"" is used to refer back to the subject ""The journalists"".   In this sentence, ""They"" is a third-person plural pronoun, and it is used to refer to the subject of the sentence, which is ""The journalists"". This is an example of a pronoun that is used to avoid repetition of the noun and to improve the sentence's clarity and flow.  The reasoning behind this choice is that ""The journalists"" is a plural noun, and the pronoun ""They"" is also plural, which matches the grammatical number of the subject."	141	
1760564568	1760564569	"Joan made sure to thank Susan for all the help she had given.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Susan""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""she"" refers to Joan.   The reason for this is that ""she"" is a pronoun that is used as a subject, and it is in a position that would normally follow a subject in a sentence. Since ""Joan"" is the subject of the sentence (the one performing the action), the pronoun ""she"" is used to refer back to Joan as the one doing the thanking."	87	
1760564569	1760564570	"In the storm, the tree fell down and crashed through the roof of my house. Now, I have to get it repaired.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""The roof""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""it"" refers to ""The tree"".   This is an example of a pronoun reference, where a pronoun (""it"") is used to replace a noun (""the tree"") in the sentence. The context and the surrounding words help to clarify the intended meaning."	57	
1760564570	1760564571	"Beth didn't get angry with Sally , who had cut her off, because she stopped and counted to ten.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Beth""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""she"" refers to Beth.

1760564571	1760564572	"The lawyer asked the witness a question, but he was reluctant to repeat it.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""the lawyer""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""he"" refers to ""the witness"".   This is because the subject of the sentence is ""the witness"", and the pronoun ""he"" is a subject pronoun that agrees with it in gender. The verb ""was reluctant"" also agrees with the subject ""the witness""."	62	
1760564572	1760564573	"Sir Clifford wants me to find him a new groom , about twenty or twenty-one, who knows his business. His old coachman is getting feeble, and he wants a man to work with him and get into his ways, who would be able, when the old man was pensioned off, to step into his place  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""new groom""? Explain your choice."	"In the given sentence, ""his"" refers to ""Sir Clifford"".   The reason for this is that the sentence starts with ""Sir Clifford wants"", indicating that the subject of the sentence is Sir Clifford. The pronoun ""his"" is then used to refer to something that belongs to Sir Clifford, which in this case is ""old coachman""."	71	
1760564573	1760564574	"Since it was raining, I carried the newspaper over my backpack to keep it dry.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""The newspaper""? Explain your choice."	"In the given sentence, ""it"" refers to the rain. The sentence implies that you used the newspaper as a makeshift shelter or cover to protect yourself and possibly your backpack from getting wet because of the rain."	43	
1760564574	1760564576	"If the con artist has succeeded in fooling Sam , he would have gotten a lot of money.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""The con artist""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""he"" refers to ""The con artist.""   The pronoun ""he"" is used as a third-person singular masculine pronoun, which is the correct subject-verb agreement for ""the con artist."" The sentence implies that the con artist is a male, but the pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to the subject of the sentence, which is the con artist."	80	0.6
1760564576	1760564577	"The boy continued to whip the pony , and eventually the pony threw him over. John laughed out quite loud. ""Served him right,"" he said.  In the sentence above, does ""him"" refer to ""pony""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, in the sentence, ""him"" refers to the boy. The context suggests that the boy was the one being thrown by the pony, and John's comment ""Served him right"" implies that John thinks the boy deserved to be thrown for whipping the pony. This implies that ""him"" is a pronoun referring back to the subject of the sentence, the boy."	77	
1760564577	1760564579	"I put the cake away in the refrigerator . It has a lot of leftovers in it.  In the sentence above, does ""It"" refer to ""The cake""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""It"" in the sentence refers to ""The cake."" This is an example of a pronoun called a ""reflexive pronoun,"" but more specifically, in this context, it's an example of an ""indefinite pronoun"" or a ""generic pronoun.""   However, a more accurate analysis would be that ""it"" is an example of a ""noun substitute"" or an ""indefinite noun substitute"" in this sentence, because ""it"" is used to refer back to a specific noun (""the cake"") previously mentioned in the sentence."	118	
1760564579	1760564581	"The fish ate the worm . It was tasty.  In the sentence above, does ""It"" refer to ""The worm""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence ""The fish ate the worm. It was tasty,"" ""It"" is a pronoun that refers back to the subject of the sentence, which is ""the fish"".   This is an example of anaphora, where a pronoun is used to refer back to a noun that has already been mentioned in the sentence. In this case, the pronoun ""It"" is used to avoid repetition and make the sentence more concise.  So, to answer your question, ""It"" does not refer to ""the worm"", but rather to ""the fish""."	117	
1760564581	1760564582	"Babar wonders how he can get new clothing. Luckily, a very rich old man who has always been fond of little elephants understands right away that he is longing for a fine suit. As he likes to make people happy, he gives him his wallet.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Babar""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""he"" refers to the rich old man.   This is determined by the context and the pronoun's antecedent. The sentence mentions ""Babar"" as the one who is longing for a fine suit, and then it introduces ""a very rich old man"" who gives Babar his wallet. The pronoun ""he"" directly follows this introduction, making it clear that ""he"" refers to the rich old man."	92

In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""Terpsichore""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""it"" refers to ""Terpsichore"".   The pronoun ""it"" is used as a reference to the name ""Terpsichore"" in the phrase ""it was easier to pronounce"". This is because the subject of the sentence is the name ""Terpsichore"", and the phrase ""it"" is a pronoun that replaces the subject for the purpose of the sentence."	83	
1760564584	1760564585	"So Mark slept. It was daylight when he woke with Warren 's hand upon his shoulder.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Warren""? Explain your choice."	"In this sentence, ""his"" does not refer to ""Warren"".   The word ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, which means it shows that something belongs to the person being referred to by the noun it follows. In this case, ""his"" follows ""Mark"", indicating that the hand belongs to Mark.  So, the correct interpretation is that Mark woke up with his own hand on his shoulder, not Warren's hand on Mark's shoulder."	95	
1760564585	1760564587	"Fred covered his eyes with his hands , because the wind was blowing sand around. He lowered them when the wind stopped.  In the sentence above, does ""them"" refer to ""His hands""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence ""He lowered them when the wind stopped,"" ""them"" does not directly refer to ""His hands"".   In this context, ""them"" is a pronoun that refers back to the subject of the previous sentence, which is ""the wind"". The sentence structure suggests that the wind stopped, and as a result, Fred lowered something.   However, it's likely that the intended meaning is that Fred lowered his hands, but the sentence is grammatically ambiguous. A more clear sentence would be ""He lowered his hands when the wind stopped."""	113	
1760564587	1760564589	"Sir Clifford wants me to find him a new groom , about twenty or twenty-one, who knows his business.

Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""his"" refers to ""Sir Clifford"".

"Yes, ""he"" refers to ""Joe"". This is because the subject of the sentence is ""Joe"", and the pronoun ""he"" is a third-person singular masculine pronoun that agrees with the subject. In English grammar, when a subject is singular and masculine, the pronoun ""he"" is typically used to refer back to that subject."	72	
1760564590	1760564591	"As Andrea in the crop duster passed over Susan , she could see the landing strip.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Susan""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""she"" does not refer to ""Susan"".   In the sentence, ""Andrea"" is the subject, and ""she"" is a pronoun that refers back to ""Andrea"". This is an example of anaphora, where a pronoun is used to refer back to a noun that has already been mentioned earlier in the sentence or in the text."	77	
1760564591	1760564593	"Frank was upset with Tom because the toaster he had bought from him didn't work.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Tom""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""he"" refers to ""Tom"" in this sentence.   The reason for this is that ""he"" is the subject of the clause ""he had bought from him"", and the subject of a clause must agree with the subject of the sentence. Since ""Tom"" is the subject of the sentence (""Tom... didn't work""), ""he"" must refer to ""Tom"" to make the sentence grammatically correct."	87	
1760564593	1760564594	"Lily spoke to Donna , breaking her silence.  In the sentence above, does ""her"" refer to ""Donna""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""her"" refers to ""Lily"".

1760564594	1760564595	"The cat was lying by the mouse hole waiting for the mouse , but it was too cautious.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""The cat""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""it"" refers to ""the mouse"".   The reasoning is based on the context and the typical behavior of a predator and its prey. A cat is waiting by a mouse hole for the mouse to emerge, implying that the cat is waiting to catch the mouse. The word ""it"" is used in a way that suggests the cat is waiting for the mouse, rather than the cat itself."	84	
1760564595	1760564596	"Equally swoon-worthy is C.K. Dexter Haven , a pallid young dandy holding a jade-handled walking stick, with a poodle asleep at his feet  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Haven""? Explain your choice."	"In the given sentence, ""his"" refers to ""Dexter Haven"".   The reason is that ""his"" is an adjective that agrees with the noun ""poodle"", which is the object that the poodle is asleep at. Since the poodle belongs to Dexter Haven, the possessive pronoun ""his"" is used to show that it is Dexter Haven's poodle."	78	
1760564596	1760564599	"Sir Clifford wants me to find him a new groom , about twenty or twenty-one, who knows his business. His old coachman is getting feeble, and he wants a man to work with him and get into his ways, who would be able, when the old man was pensioned off, to step into his place.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Sir Clifford""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""his"" refers to the coachman.   The reasoning is as follows:   1. The sentence starts with ""Sir Clifford wants me to find him a new groom"", which introduces Sir Clifford as the person making the request. 2. The phrase ""his old coachman"" directly after that implies that ""his"" refers to the coachman, as it is describing a person who belongs to or is associated with the coachman. 3. The subsequent context, ""who knows his business"", continues to refer to the coachman, as it is discussing the qualities of the person who will be replacing him. 4. The phrase ""who would be able, when the old man was pensioned off, to step into his place"" further supports this interpretation, as ""his"" refers to the coachman's position or role, not Sir Clifford's."	180	
1760564599	1760564601	"The fish ate the worm . It was tasty.  In the sentence above, does ""It"" refer to ""The fish""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""It"" refers to ""The fish.""   This is an example of a pronoun called a ""reflexive pronoun,"" which refers back to the subject of the sentence. In this case, ""It"" is the object of the verb ""ate."" The sentence could be rephrased as ""The fish ate the worm. The fish was tasty,"" but the original sentence implies that the fish enjoyed eating the worm, not that the fish itself was tasty."	98	0.5714285714285714

The pronoun ""him"" is a direct object pronoun, which is used to refer to a person or animal being acted upon by the verb. In this case, the verb ""send"" is acting on Geoffrey, and ""him"" is the direct object."	69	
1760564602	1760564604	"The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence.  In the sentence above, does ""they"" refer to ""The city councilmen""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence ""The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence,"" ""they"" refers to ""the city councilmen"".   The pronoun ""they"" is used as a subject-verb agreement to refer back to ""the city councilmen"", who are performing the action of fearing violence. This is an example of a reflexive pronoun, where ""they"" is used to refer back to the same subject that performed the previous action, which in this case is ""the city councilmen""."	105	
1760564604	1760564606	"Frank felt vindicated when his longtime rival Bill revealed that he was the winner of the competition.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Bill""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""he"" refers to ""Bill"".   This is because the sentence is in a passive voice construction, specifically a passive construction where ""Bill"" is the subject of the verb ""revealed"", and the pronoun ""he"" is used as a pronoun to refer back to Bill after the verb. This is a common grammatical construction used to change the focus of the sentence from the doer of the action (Bill) to the person affected by the action (Frank)."	99

"Yes, ""He"" refers to ""Bob"".   The reason is that ""He"" is a pronoun used to refer back to a male noun that has been mentioned earlier in the sentence. In this case, ""Bob"" is the male noun that has been mentioned, and ""He"" is used to refer to him after he has collapsed on the sidewalk."	74	
1760564607	1760564608	"Dan took the rear seat while Bill claimed the front because his ""Dibs!"" was slow.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Bill""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""his"" refers to ""Bill."" The reason is that ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, indicating that the ""Dibs!"" belongs to Bill.

The pronoun ""he"" is used as a subject pronoun to refer to a male person previously mentioned. In this case, the subject of the sentence is ""Pete,"" and the verb ""envies"" requires a subject pronoun to match the subject-verb agreement. Therefore, ""he"" is used to refer back to ""Pete"" as the subject of the sentence."	91	
1760564611	1760564612	"Billy cried because Toby wouldn't share his toy.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Billy""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""his"" refers to ""Billy.""

1760564612	1760564615	"I poured water from the bottle into the cup until it was full.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""the bottle""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence ""I poured water from the bottle into the cup until it was full,"" ""it"" refers to ""the cup.""   The reason for this is that the subject of the sentence is ""I,"" and the action described is ""I poured."" The phrase ""from the bottle into the cup"" is a prepositional phrase that indicates the location and direction of the action, but it doesn't change the subject of the sentence. The verb ""was"" is in the predicate of the sentence, and its subject is ""it,"" which must refer to the object of the action described by the verb ""poured."" Since ""poured"" is an action performed on ""the cup,"" ""it"" logically refers to ""the cup."""	151	
1760564615	1760564616	"I used an old rag to clean the knife , and then I put it in the trash.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""The knife""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""it"" refers to ""the knife"". This is an example of anaphora, where a pronoun (in this case, ""it"") is used to refer back to a previously mentioned noun (the knife). This is a common grammatical technique used in English to avoid repetition and create more concise sentences. In this sentence, the pronoun ""it"" is used to refer to the knife that was cleaned and put in the trash, rather than repeating the word ""knife"" again."	102

"In the sentence ""John hired Bill to take care of him,"" ""him"" is a pronoun that refers to John. This is because the verb ""take care of"" is a verb phrase that typically requires a direct object, and in this case, the direct object is the person or entity being taken care of, which is John. The sentence would not make sense if ""him"" referred to Bill, as Bill is the one doing the action of hiring, not being taken care of."	100	
1760564618	1760564620	"Jane knocked on the door, and Susan answered it. She invited her to come out.  In the sentence above, does ""She"" refer to ""Jane""? Explain your choice."

"In this sentence, ""she"" does not refer to ""Dora"". The pronoun ""she"" is actually referring to ""Maude"".   This is because the sentence structure and context imply that Maude is the person who should have buttoned up Dora's dress, but failed to do so, leaving Dora to do it alone. Therefore, when the sentence mentions ""she had left poor little Dora"", the subject ""she"" logically refers to Maude, the person who was supposed to button up the dress but didn't."	111
