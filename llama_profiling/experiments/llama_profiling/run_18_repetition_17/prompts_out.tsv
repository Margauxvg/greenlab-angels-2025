1760539827	1760539828	Passage: Persian language -- Persian (/ˈpɜːrʒən, -ʃən/), also known by its endonym Farsi (فارسی fārsi (fɒːɾˈsiː) ( listen)), is one of the Western Iranian languages within the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family. It is primarily spoken in Iran, Afghanistan (officially known as Dari since 1958), and Tajikistan (officially known as Tajiki since the Soviet era), and some other regions which historically were Persianate societies and considered part of Greater Iran. It is written in the Persian alphabet, a modified variant of the Arabic script, which itself evolved from the Aramaic alphabet.  Question: do iran and afghanistan speak the same language  Explain your choice.	"I would say that Iran and Afghanistan do not speak the same language.  The passage states that Iran and Afghanistan are ""officially known as Dari since 1958"", indicating that Dari is the official language of these two countries. However, this is a historical development. Prior to 1958, Afghanistan was known as Afghanistan, and Dari was considered an unofficial language of the country.  In the 20th century, Dari began to gain more official status, and in 1958, Afghanistan officially adopted Dari as its national language. This means that while Dari is still widely spoken and used in everyday life, it is not the only language used in the country."	141
1760539828	1760539829	Passage: Good Samaritan law -- Good Samaritan laws offer legal protection to people who give reasonable assistance to those who are, or who they believe to be, injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. The protection is intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, for fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. An example of such a law in common-law areas of Canada: a good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing. Its purpose is to keep people from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in treatment. By contrast, a duty to rescue law requires people to offer assistance and holds those who fail to do so liable.  Question: do good samaritan laws protect those who help at an accident  Explain your choice.	Good Samaritan laws protect those who help at an accident, but only if they do so in good faith. This means that even if the person assisting is not a medical professional or is not trying to cause harm to the injured person, they can still be held liable if they make a mistake in their treatment. The law is intended to balance the need to help those in distress with the need to prevent liability for medical professionals who make errors in their care.  In other words, good Samaritan laws do not automatically protect individuals who help someone in an emergency, as long as they do so in a way that is not intended to cause harm. However, they do provide a safeguard for medical professionals who are trying to provide proper care and do not have malicious intent.  To illustrate this, consider the following example:  A doctor helps a patient who has suffered a severe injury while working in a hospital. The doctor provides the patient with medical attention, but the patient is later found to have been treated with an unnecessary medication that caused the injury. The patient sues the doctor for malpractice, claiming that the doctor was negligent in their treatment. If the doctor had acted in good faith, following proper medical protocols, they would be protected by good Samaritan laws and would not be liable for the patient's injuries.  However, if the doctor had intentionally administered the unnecessary medication, the doctor would be liable for the patient's injuries, even if they acted in good faith.  In summary, good Samaritan laws protect individuals who help someone in an emergency, but only if they do so in good faith and without malicious intent.	327
1760539829	1760539830	Passage: Windows Movie Maker -- Windows Movie Maker (formerly known as Windows Live Movie Maker in Windows 7) is a discontinued video editing software by Microsoft. It is a part of Windows Essentials software suite and offers the ability to create and edit videos as well as to publish them on OneDrive, Facebook, Vimeo, YouTube, and Flickr.  Question: is windows movie maker part of windows essentials  Explain your choice.	I would classify Windows Movie Maker as part of Windows Essentials, but I would make a slight distinction.  Windows Essentials is a suite of applications that was bundled with Windows Vista, and it included Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007, Microsoft Windows Media Center, Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft Excel 2007, Microsoft PowerPoint 2007, and Microsoft OneNote 2007. Windows Essentials was discontinued in 2010, and the components were eventually removed from the Windows operating system.  Windows Movie Maker is still a standalone application that is included in Windows, but it is no longer a part of the Windows Essentials suite. It is available for purchase separately and is a standalone video editing software that is separate from the other Microsoft Office applications.  So, while Windows Movie Maker is still included in Windows, it is no longer considered part of the Windows Essentials suite.	176
1760539830	1760539831	Passage: Powdered sugar -- Powdered sugar, also called confectioners' sugar, icing sugar, and icing cake, is a finely ground sugar produced by milling granulated sugar into a powdered state. It usually contains a small amount of anti-caking agent to prevent clumping and improve flow. Although most often produced in a factory, powdered sugar can also be made by processing ordinary granulated sugar in a coffee grinder, or by crushing it by hand in a mortar and pestle.  Question: is confectionary sugar the same as powdered sugar  Explain your choice.	Confectionary sugar and powdered sugar are often used interchangeably, but they are not exactly the same.   Confectionary sugar, also known as icing sugar or icing sugar, is a type of sugar that is finely ground and has a high sugar content. It is often used in baking, decorating, and cooking, particularly in sweet dishes like cakes, pastries, and frostings. Confectionary sugar typically has a higher sugar content (around 50-60%) than regular granulated sugar.  Powdered sugar, on the other hand, is a finer and more refined version of granulated sugar. It is often used as a sweetener and is commonly used in baking, but it can be used as a topping or used to dust surfaces. Powdered sugar typically has a lower sugar content (around 20-30%) than confectionary sugar.  While both confectionary sugar and powdered sugar can be used interchangeably in some recipes, confectionary sugar is generally considered to be a more dense and refined sugar, whereas powdered sugar is lighter and more delicate. However, the difference is relatively subtle, and the terms are often used interchangeably in most contexts.  In the passage, it is worth noting that powdered sugar is sometimes referred to as confectionary sugar in certain regions or in specific contexts, but in general, the terms are used interchangeably.	279
1760539831	1760539832	Passage: The Elder Scrolls Online -- As with other games in The Elder Scrolls series, the game is set on the continent of Tamriel. The events of the game occur a millennium before those of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and around 800 years before The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. It has a broadly similar structure to Skyrim, with two separate conflicts progressing at the same time, one with the fate of the world in the balance, and one where the prize is supreme power on Tamriel. In The Elder Scrolls Online, the first struggle is against the Daedric Prince Molag Bal, who is attempting to meld the plane of Mundus with his realm of Coldharbour, and the second is to capture the vacant imperial throne, contested by three alliances of the mortal races. The player character has been sacrificed to Molag Bal, and Molag Bal has stolen their soul, the recovery of which is the primary game objective.  Question: is elder scrolls online the same as skyrim  Explain your choice.	The passage compares The Elder Scrolls Online to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, but with some key differences. Here's my analysis:  1. **Setting**: The passage mentions that the events of The Elder Scrolls Online occur a millennium before those of Skyrim, which means that the world of Tamriel in The Elder Scrolls Online is around 800 years before the events of Skyrim. While Skyrim is set around the same time period as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, The Elder Scrolls Online is set 800 years earlier.  2. **Two separate conflicts**: The passage states that there are two separate conflicts in The Elder Scrolls Online: one with the fate of the world in the balance, and one where the prize is supreme power on Tamriel. In contrast, Skyrim has two main conflicts as well: the Civil War and the return of the dragons. The passage does not mention any other significant conflicts besides these two.  3. **Main objective**: The passage mentions that the player character has been sacrificed to Molag Bal and that Molag Bal has stolen their soul, as the primary game objective. This is a significant difference from Skyrim, where the main objective is to defeat Alduin the World-Eater and save Tamriel.  4. **Molag Bal's role**: In Skyrim, Molag Bal is a Daedric Prince who seeks to bring about the destruction of Tamriel. In The Elder Scrolls Online, Molag Bal is a Daedric Prince who is attempting to meld the plane of Mundus with his realm of Coldharbour, which is a separate entity. This suggests that the focus of the game is more on the conflict with the Daedric Prince rather than the return of the dragons.  5. **Tone and scope**: The passage also mentions that The Elder Scrolls Online has a more complex and darker tone compared to Skyrim, which is more focused on the return of the dragons and the civil war. The passage does not mention any other aspects of The Elder Scrolls Online's tone or scope that are unique to the game.  In summary, while both games are part of the Elder Scrolls series, they have distinct differences in their settings, objectives, and tones. The Elder Scrolls Online is more focused on the conflict with Molag Bal and the fate of the world, whereas Skyrim is more focused on the return of the dragons and the civil war.	485
1760539832	1760539833	Passage: Epsom railway station -- Epsom railway station serves the town of Epsom in Surrey. It is located off Waterloo Road and is less than two minutes' walk from the High Street. It is not in the London Oyster card zone unlike Epsom Downs or Tattenham Corner stations. The station building was replaced in 2012/2013 with a new building with apartments above the station (see end of article).  Question: can you use oyster card at epsom station  Explain your choice.	Based on the information provided, I can conclude that it is not possible to use an Oyster card at Epsom station.   The passage states that the station is not in the London Oyster card zone, unlike Epsom Downs or Tattenham Corner stations. This implies that Oyster cards are not accepted at Epsom station.	71
1760539833	1760539833	Passage: Da Vinci's Demons -- The series premiered in the United States on Starz on 12 April 2013, and its second season premiered on 22 March 2014. The series was renewed for a third season, which premiered on 24 October 2015. On 23 July 2015, Starz announced that the third season would be the show's last. However Goyer has left it open for a miniseries return.  Question: will there be a season 4 of da vinci's demons  Explain your choice.	Based on the information provided, there is no indication that Da Vinci's Demons will have a season 4. The passage mentions that the third season was renewed, but it explicitly states that it was the show's last.   However, the passage also mentions that Goyer has left the show, but does not rule out the possibility of a miniseries return. Therefore, it is possible that a miniseries could be produced, but it would not be a season 4 of the show.	102
1760539833	1760539834	Passage: Federal judiciary of the United States -- The federal courts are composed of three levels of courts. The Supreme Court of the United States is the court of last resort. It is generally an appellate court that operates under discretionary review, which means that the Court can choose which cases to hear, by granting writs of certiorari. There is therefore generally no basic right of appeal that extends automatically all the way to the Supreme Court. In a few situations (like lawsuits between state governments or some cases between the federal government and a state) it sits as a court of original jurisdiction.  Question: is the federal court the same as the supreme court  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, I would say that the federal court is not the same as the Supreme Court.  The passage states that the Supreme Court is ""the court of last resort"" and is ""an appellate court that operates under discretionary review"". This implies that the Supreme Court has the final say in cases, and it has the power to hear cases by granting writs of certiorari. In contrast, the passage does not mention the Supreme Court having a ""right of appeal"" that extends to all the way to the Supreme Court.  In addition, the passage also mentions that the Supreme Court ""sits as a court of original jurisdiction"" in cases between the federal government and a state, implying that the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over certain types of cases, but not all cases.  Therefore, the passage suggests that the federal courts are a separate entity from the Supreme Court, and that the Supreme Court has a more limited jurisdiction and a different role in the federal judiciary."	197
1760539834	1760539834	Passage: Bixby letter -- In the 1998 war film Saving Private Ryan, General George Marshall (played by Harve Presnell) reads the Bixby letter to his officers before giving the order to find and send home Private James Francis Ryan after Ryan's three brothers died in battle.  Question: did abraham lincoln write the letter in saving private ryan  Explain your choice.	I was unable to verify if Abraham Lincoln wrote the letter in Saving Private Ryan.	17
1760539834	1760539834	Passage: Batman & Robin (film) -- With the box office success of Batman Forever in June 1995, Warner Bros. immediately commissioned a sequel. They hired director Joel Schumacher and writer Akiva Goldsman to reprise their duties the following August, and decided it was best to fast track production for a June 1997 target release date, which is a break from the usual 3-year gap between films. Schumacher wanted to homage both the broad camp style of the 1960s television series and the work of Dick Sprang. The storyline of Batman & Robin was conceived by Schumacher and Goldsman during pre-production on A Time to Kill. Portions of Mr. Freeze's back-story were based on the Batman: The Animated Series episode ``Heart of Ice'', written by Paul Dini.  Question: is batman and robin a sequel to batman forever  Explain your choice.	Based on the information provided, it appears that Batman & Robin is not a direct sequel to Batman Forever. Here's why:  * The passage mentions that the film was commissioned by Warner Bros. immediately after Batman Forever, but it doesn't explicitly state that Batman & Robin was made as a sequel to Batman Forever. * The passage also mentions that the storyline of Batman & Robin was conceived by Joel Schumacher and Akiva Goldsman during pre-production on A Time to Kill, but it doesn't establish a direct connection to Batman Forever. * The passage doesn't mention any significant connections or similarities between the two films, such as a shared plot or characters, which would be expected if Batman & Robin was a direct sequel to Batman Forever.  Overall, it seems that Batman & Robin is a standalone film with a different storyline, possibly inspired by the 1960s television series and the work of Dick Sprang.	186
1760539834	1760539835	Passage: Badger -- Badgers are short-legged omnivores in the family Mustelidae, which also includes the otters, polecats, weasels, and wolverines. They belong to the caniform suborder of carnivoran mammals. The 11 species of badgers are grouped in three subfamilies: Melinae (Eurasian badgers), Mellivorinae (the honey badger or ratel), and Taxideinae (the American badger). The Asiatic stink badgers of the genus Mydaus were formerly included within Melinae (and thus Mustelidae), but recent genetic evidence indicates these are actually members of the skunk family, placing them in the taxonomic family Mephitidae.  Question: is a wolverine the same as a badger  Explain your choice.	No, a wolverine is not the same as a badger. Here's why:  1. Family: Wolverines belong to the family Mustelidae, while badgers belong to the family Mustelidae as well. This suggests that the two are closely related and share a common ancestor.  2. Physical Characteristics: Wolverines and badgers have different physical characteristics, such as their body size, skull shape, and dental structure. Wolverines are generally larger and more robust than badgers, with longer legs and a more pronounced hump on their shoulders.  3. Behavior: While both are carnivorous mammals, wolverines are primarily nocturnal and solitary, whereas badgers are generally more social and have a more varied diet that includes both plant and animal matter.  4. Taxonomy: As mentioned in the passage, wolverines are now classified as members of the family Mephitidae, while badgers are classified as members of the family Mustelidae.  5. Distribution: Wolverines are found in North America, Asia, and Europe, while badgers are found in North America, Europe, and Asia.  Therefore, while both wolverines and badgers are members of the Mustelidae family, they are distinct species with different characteristics, habits, and distributions.	271
1760539835	1760539836	Passage: Green Lantern (film) -- Green Lantern was released on June 17, 2011, and received generally negative reviews; most criticized the film for its screenplay, inconsistent tone, choice and portrayal of villains, and its use of CGI, while some praised Reynolds' performance. Reynolds would later voice his dissatisfaction with the film. The film underperformed at the box office, grossing $219 million against a production budget of $200 million. Due to the film's negative reception and disappointing box office performance, Warner Bros. canceled any plans for a sequel, instead opting to reboot the character in the DC Extended Universe line with the film Green Lantern Corps, set for release in 2020.  Question: will there be a green lantern 2 movie  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, it appears that there will not be a Green Lantern 2 movie. The passage states that the original film ""Green Lantern"" was canceled due to its negative reception and disappointing box office performance. Instead, the film's producers opted to reboot the character in the DC Extended Universe with a new movie, titled ""Green Lantern Corps"", set for release in 2020."	79
1760539836	1760539837	Passage: United States and the International Criminal Court -- The United States should have the chance to observe and assess the functioning of the court, over time, before choosing to become subject to its jurisdiction. Given these concerns, I will not, and do not recommend that my successor, submit the treaty to the Senate for advice and consent until our fundamental concerns are satisfied.  Question: does the icc has jurisdiction in the united states  Explain your choice.	The passage you've provided appears to be a statement from a US politician expressing concerns about the International Criminal Court (ICC) and its potential impact on the United States. To address your question, I'll break down the passage and provide an analysis.  The passage suggests that the United States has concerns about the ICC's jurisdiction over the United States, and the speaker implies that the US should have the opportunity to assess and observe the court's functioning before deciding whether to submit the treaty to the Senate for advice and consent.  The key points from the passage are:  1. **Concerns about jurisdiction**: The speaker expresses concerns that the ICC might have jurisdiction over the US, citing fundamental concerns about national sovereignty and the potential for the court to undermine US authority. 2. **Observation and assessment**: The speaker suggests that the US should have the chance to observe and assess the ICC's functioning before deciding whether to submit the treaty for Senate advice and consent. 3. **No immediate action**: The speaker explicitly states that they do not recommend submitting the treaty to the Senate for advice and consent immediately.  Based on this passage, it appears that the speaker is leaning towards the idea that the ICC does not have jurisdiction over the US. Here are the reasoning steps that support this conclusion:  * The passage implies that the US has fundamental concerns about the ICC's jurisdiction, which suggests that the speaker believes the ICC's jurisdiction is not compatible with US national sovereignty. * The speaker suggests that the US should have the opportunity to assess the ICC's functioning before deciding whether to submit the treaty for Senate advice and consent, which implies that the speaker is cautious about the ICC's potential impact on US sovereignty. * The speaker explicitly states that they do not recommend submitting the treaty to the Senate for advice and consent immediately, which further reinforces the idea that the speaker is skeptical about the ICC's jurisdiction.  Overall, the passage suggests that the speaker is cautious about the ICC's jurisdiction over the US and is considering the potential consequences of submitting the treaty for Senate advice and consent.	415
1760539837	1760539837	Passage: Calcium carbide -- Calcium carbide is a chemical compound with the chemical formula of CaC. Its main use industrially is in the production of acetylene and calcium cyanamide.  Question: calcium carbide cac2 is the raw material for the production of acetylene  Explain your choice.	To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the passage:  The passage states that calcium carbide has the chemical formula of CaC2.   In chemical notation, calcium carbide is represented as CaC2, which is the chemical formula for calcium carbide.   Given that calcium carbide cac2 is the raw material for the production of acetylene, it can be inferred that acetylene is produced from calcium carbide.   Acetylene is a compound with the chemical formula C2H2, which is the same as calcium carbide (CaC2). Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that calcium carbide cac2 is the raw material for the production of acetylene.	144
1760539837	1760539838	Passage: Now You See Me (film series) -- Now You See Me is a series of heist thriller film written by Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin, and Edward Ricourt. They focus on the actions of a team of illusionists named ``The Four Horsemen'' who pull off near impossible heists. The series features an ensemble cast including Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Michael Caine, Lizzy Caplan, and Morgan Freeman. The first film was released in 2013, while the second was released in 2016, and a third film is currently in development and set to be released in 2019. The series has received mixed reviews from critics and audiences and grossed nearly $700 million worldwide.  Question: is there a now you see me 3 coming out  Explain your choice.	"There is no information about a ""Now You See Me 3"" film, but there is a sequel to the series called ""Now You See Me 3: The Second Act"" which is indeed in development, and it is set to be released in 2024."	56
1760539838	1760539838	Passage: Penalty shoot-out (association football) -- A shoot-out is usually considered for statistical purposes to be separate from the match which preceded it. In the case of a two-legged fixture, the two matches are still considered either as two draws or as one win and one loss; in the case of a single match, it is still considered as a draw. This contrasts with a fixture won in extra time, where the score at the end of normal time is superseded. Converted shoot-out penalties are not considered as goals scored by a player for the purposes of their individual records, or for ``golden boot'' competitions.  Question: does a penalty shoot out goal count towards the golden boot  Explain your choice.	"My answer is: No, a penalty shoot-out goal does not count towards the golden boot.  This is because, as mentioned in the passage, in a penalty shoot-out, the score at the end of normal time is superseded, and the goal is not considered as a goal scored by the player for their individual records or for ""golden boot"" competitions. This is a unique aspect of a penalty shoot-out, where the match is not decided by a single goal, and the outcome is determined by the penalties taken in a sudden-death format."	111
1760539838	1760539838	Passage: Cutthroat Kitchen -- Cutthroat Kitchen is a cooking show hosted by Alton Brown that aired on the Food Network from August 11, 2013 to July 19, 2017. It features four chefs competing in a three-round elimination cooking competition. The contestants face auctions in which they can purchase opportunities to sabotage one another. Each chef is given $25,000 at the start of the show; the person left standing keeps whatever money they have not spent in the auctions. The show ended on its fifteenth season in July 2017. The series shares some basic elements with other four-chef, three-round elimination-style competitions on Food Network including Chopped and Guy's Grocery Games. Numerous Cutthroat Kitchen contestants have competed on these shows.  Question: will there be a new season of cutthroat kitchen  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, it appears that the current status of the show is uncertain. The passage states that the show ended on its fifteenth season in July 2017, but it does not provide any information about whether a new season is planned. The passage also mentions that ""numerous Cutthroat Kitchen contestants have competed on other shows on the Food Network,"" but it does not suggest that a new season of Cutthroat Kitchen is in production or has been announced."	94
1760539838	1760539839	Passage: Jack Sikma -- In 2006, Sikma was voted as one of the 100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament, a group of former players and coaches in honor of the 100 anniversary of the IHSA boys basketball tournament. On June 27, 2017, Sikma was inducted into the Small College Basketball Hall of Fame as part of their second class . Inducted alongside Sikma were Zelmo Beaty, Walt Frazier, Bob Love, Elmore Smith, Jim Spivey, Rico Swanson, George Tinsley, and Al Tucker.  Question: is jack sikma in the hall of fame  Explain your choice.	I chose to include Jack Sikma in the Hall of Fame because he is a notable figure in the history of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament, and his induction is a significant event in the sport's history. The passage specifically mentions that he was voted as one of the 100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament, which implies that he is a respected and accomplished figure in the history of the tournament.  Additionally, the passage states that Sikma was inducted into the Small College Basketball Hall of Fame as part of their second class, which further supports his inclusion in the Hall of Fame. This suggests that he has made significant contributions to the sport and has been recognized for his achievements, which is a key criterion for induction into a hall of fame.  Overall, the combination of his reputation as a notable figure in the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament and his induction into the Small College Basketball Hall of Fame makes it reasonable to conclude that Jack Sikma is indeed in the Hall of Fame.	200
1760539839	1760539840	Passage: Half-elven -- In J.R.R. Tolkien's fictional universe of Middle-earth, the Half-elven (Sindarin singular Peredhel, plural Peredhil, Quenya singular Perelda) are the children of the union of Elves and Men. Of these, the most significant were the products of couplings between the Eldar (the Elves who followed the Call to Valinor) and the Edain (the Men of the Three Houses of early Men who allied themselves with the Eldar in their war against Morgoth).  Question: can elves and humans mate lord of the rings  Explain your choice.	In J.R.R. Tolkien's fictional universe of Middle-earth, the passage describes the Half-Elves (Peredhel) as the children of the union of Elves and Men. However, it does not explicitly state that elves and humans cannot mate.   However, it can be inferred that the elves are a distinct and separate group from humans, and the concept of intermarriage between the two is not mentioned in the passage. The passage does imply that the Half-Elves are a separate and distinct group, suggesting that their union was not considered acceptable or normal by the rest of the world.  It is worth noting that Tolkien's own writings suggest that elves and humans did intermarry in some cases, but only within the context of the Elven kingdoms of Lindon, Dol Amroth, and Rhûn. These unions were often between elves who had already reached a certain level of maturity and had gained the consent of their kin, and were often seen as a way for the elves to maintain their cultural and racial purity.  In general, however, the passage suggests that the elves are seen as a distinct and separate group from humans, and that intermarriage between the two is not widely accepted or encouraged.	249
1760539840	1760539841	Passage: The Boy in the Plastic Bubble -- The Boy in the Plastic Bubble is a 1976 American made-for-television drama film inspired by the lives of David Vetter and Ted DeVita, who lacked effective immune systems. It stars John Travolta, Glynnis O'Connor, Diana Hyland, Robert Reed, Ralph Bellamy & P.J. Soles. It was written by Douglas Day Stewart, executive produced by Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg (who, at the time, produced Starsky and Hutch and Charlie's Angels), and directed by Randal Kleiser, who would work with Travolta again in Grease shortly after. The original music score was composed by Mark Snow. The theme song ``What Would They Say'' was written and sung by Paul Williams. William Howard Taft High School in Woodland Hills was used for filming.  Question: the boy in the plastic bubble based on true story  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, I would choose the following answer:  The boy in the plastic bubble, David Vetter, was inspired by his real-life case.  Here's why:  - The passage mentions that the film is ""inspired by the lives of David Vetter and Ted DeVita, who lacked effective immune systems"", which suggests that the film is based on the real-life experiences of David Vetter and Ted DeVita.  - The passage also mentions that David Vetter's condition, being a ""boy in a plastic bubble"", is the central plot point of the story.  Additionally, the passage mentions that the film was written by Douglas Day Stewart, who was involved in the production of Starsky and Hutch, and that Randal Kleiser, the director of Grease, was also involved in the production of the film, which further supports the connection to real-life events.  So, based on the information provided, it appears that the film is indeed based on the real-life story of David Vetter and Ted DeVita."	212
1760539841	1760539841	Passage: A priori and a posteriori -- These terms are used with respect to reasoning (epistemology) to distinguish ``necessary conclusions from first premises'' (i.e., what must come before sense observation) from ``conclusions based on sense observation'' (which must follow it). Thus, the two kinds of knowledge, justification, or argument, may be glossed:  Question: science begins with the premise that knowledge should first be acquired through observation  Explain your choice.	The passage states that science begins with the premise that knowledge should be acquired through observation. This suggests that the two types of knowledge, justification and argument, can be distinguished by their origin.  The distinction between a priori and a posteriori knowledge is based on the source of the knowledge itself. A priori knowledge is knowledge that can be known independently of sense observation. In other words, it is knowledge that can be derived through reasoning alone, without needing to be observed through sense perception. This is typically the case for mathematical truths, logical principles, and metaphysical truths.  On the other hand, a posteriori knowledge is knowledge that is derived from sense observation. It is knowledge that requires the observation of the world through our senses to acquire. This is the case for empirical evidence, scientific observations, and everyday experiences.  Therefore, the passage suggests that science begins with a priori knowledge, which is acquired through reasoning alone, and that a posteriori knowledge is acquired through sense observation. This distinction highlights the difference between a theoretical understanding of the world (a priori knowledge) and an empirical understanding of the world (a posteriori knowledge).	231
1760539841	1760539842	Passage: Tim Brown (American football) -- Timothy Donell Brown (born July 22, 1966) is a former American football wide receiver who played professionally in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Notre Dame, where he won the Heisman Trophy, becoming the first wide receiver to win the award. He spent sixteen years with the Los Angeles/Oakland Raiders, during which he established himself as one of the NFL's most prolific wide receivers. Brown has also played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In 2015, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  Question: is tim brown in the hall of fame  Explain your choice.	I choose that Tim Brown is in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.   Here's my reasoning:  1. **Professional career**: Tim Brown played 16 seasons in the NFL, which is a notable achievement, especially considering the number of years he played at the highest level. 2. **Award recognition**: He won the Heisman Trophy, which is one of the most prestigious individual awards in college football, and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, indicating his impact on the sport. 3. **Legacy**: Brown is often considered one of the greatest wide receivers in NFL history, with his achievements in the league. 4. **Career longevity**: He played for several teams, which suggests that he was a consistent performer and a key contributor to his teams' success. 5. **Post-playing career**: He has been involved in various business ventures and charitable activities, which implies that he has maintained a level of visibility and influence in the sports world.  Overall, while there are other notable NFL players who may be in the Hall of Fame, Tim Brown's achievements, longevity, and lasting impact on the sport make a strong case for him being inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.	248
1760539842	1760539843	Passage: Drinking in public -- Drinking in public in Denmark is legal in general. The law forbids ``disturbing of the public law and order''. Thus general consumption is accepted. Several cafes have outdoor serving in the same zones.  Question: can you drink alcohol in public in denmark  Explain your choice.	"In Denmark, the law allows general consumption of alcohol in public, but there are some restrictions and guidelines to be aware of. The main issue is the ""disturbing the public law and order"" clause, which means that excessive noise or behavior can be a problem. While drinking in public is generally allowed, drinking in public places, such as cafes, is not explicitly permitted in most cases.  However, there are some exceptions:  1. **Cafes and restaurants**: These establishments are often allowed to serve alcohol in public, as long as they follow specific guidelines, such as maintaining a reasonable volume of noise and respecting the local noise regulations. 2. **Bars and pubs**: In some areas, bars and pubs are allowed to serve alcohol in public, but they are required to close by a certain time and to ensure that patrons are not disturbing others. 3. **Beach and public beaches**: Drinking in public is allowed on beaches and public beaches, but the authorities can intervene if there are concerns about noise, litter, or other issues.  In summary, while drinking in public is generally allowed in Denmark, there are specific guidelines and restrictions to be followed, and excessive behavior can be a problem."	247
1760539843	1760539844	Passage: Jersey pound -- Both Jersey and Bank of England notes are legal tender in Jersey and circulate together, alongside the Guernsey pound and Scottish banknotes. The Jersey notes are not legal tender in the United Kingdom but are legal currency, so creditors and traders may accept them if they so choose.  Question: is jersey currency legal tender in the uk  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, I would say that the Jersey currency (the Jersey pound) is not legal tender in the United Kingdom. Here's why:  * The passage states that Jersey notes are ""legal tender in Jersey and circulate together"" alongside the Guernsey pound and Scottish banknotes. This suggests that Jersey notes are recognized as legal tender in Jersey, but not in the UK. * Additionally, it's mentioned that the Jersey notes are not ""legal currency"", implying that they are not widely accepted or recognized as a valid form of payment in the UK.  Overall, the passage implies that the Jersey pound is a distinct currency that is not recognized or accepted in the UK, and therefore, it is not considered legal tender in the UK."	152
1760539844	1760539844	Passage: Milwaukee Bucks -- The Bucks have won one league title (1971), two conference titles (1971 and 1974), and 13 division titles (1971--1974, 1976, 1980--1986, 2001). They have featured such notable players as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Sidney Moncrief, Oscar Robertson, Bob Dandridge, Bob Lanier, Glenn Robinson, Ray Allen, Sam Cassell, Junior Bridgeman, Michael Redd, Terry Cummings, Vin Baker, Jon McGlocklin, Marques Johnson, and Brian Winters.  Question: have the milwaukee bucks ever won a championship  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, my answer is: No, the Milwaukee Bucks have not won a league title (NBA championship).  The passage specifically mentions the following years in which the Bucks won conference titles and division titles, but not league titles:  - 1971 (one conference title) - 1974 (one conference title) - 1976 (one division title) - 1980 (one division title) - 2001 (one division title)  However, there is no mention of the Bucks winning a league title.	111
1760539844	1760539844	Passage: List of FIFA World Cup penalty shoot-outs -- This is a list of all penalty shoot-outs that have occurred in the Finals tournament of the FIFA World Cup. Penalty shoot-outs were introduced as tie-breakers in the 1978 World Cup but did not occur before 1982. The first time a World Cup title was won by penalty shoot-out was in 1994. The only other time was in 2006. By the end of the 2018 edition, 30 shoot-outs have taken place in the World Cup. Of these, only two reached the sudden death stage after still being tied at the end of ``best of five kicks''.  Question: does the world cup final go to penalties  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, the answer is ""yes"", the World Cup final does go to penalties.  The passage states that ""Penalty shoot-outs were introduced as tie-breakers in the 1978 World Cup"" and that the first time a World Cup title was won by penalty shoot-out was in 1994."	66
1760539844	1760539845	Passage: Kingdom (manga) -- Kingdom (キングダム, Kingudamu) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yasuhisa Hara (原泰久, Hara Yasuhisa). The manga provides a fictionalized account of the Warring States period primarily through the experiences of the war orphan Xin and his comrades as he fights to become the greatest general under the heavens, and in doing so, unifying China for the first time in history. The series was adapted into a thirty-eight episode anime series by studio Pierrot that aired from June 4, 2012 to February 25, 2013. A second season was announced and aired from June 8, 2013 to March 1, 2014. An English language release of the anime was licensed by Funimation.  Question: is kingdom manga based on a true story  Explain your choice.	"I would say that the passage is not based on a true story.  The passage describes the manga series ""Kingdom"" as a fictionalized account of the Warring States period, primarily through the experiences of the war orphan Xin and his comrades. While the manga series is based on historical events and figures, such as the Warring States period, it is not a factual retelling of real events. The series takes creative liberties with the history and characters, making it a work of fiction rather than a historically accurate depiction of the period.  There is no indication in the passage that the series is based on a true story, but rather that it is a work of creative interpretation and imagination."	140
1760539845	1760539845	Passage: European Economic Area -- As of 2014 the contracting parties to the EEA are 3 of the 4 EFTA member states and 27 of the 28 EU member states. The 28th and newest EU member, Croatia, finished negotiating their accession to the EEA in November 2013, and since 12 April 2014 is provisionally applying the agreement pending its ratification by all EEA member states.  Question: is croatia part of the european economic area  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, Croatia is not a part of the European Economic Area (EEA).   The passage states that as of 2014, the contracting parties to the EEA are 3 of the 4 EFTA member states and 27 of the 28 EU member states. This indicates that Croatia, being a new member of the EU, is not included in the group of EFTA member states.	85
1760539845	1760539846	Passage: Posthumous marriage -- Posthumous marriage (or necrogamy) is a marriage in which one of the participating members is deceased. It is legal in France and similar forms are practiced in Sudan and China. Since World War I, France has had hundreds of requests each year, of which many have been accepted.  Question: can u marry a dead person in france  Explain your choice.	In France, the concept of posthumous marriage, also known as necrogamy, is indeed legal, but with certain conditions and limitations.  To marry a deceased person, the following conditions must be met:  1. **The deceased must be a family member**: The person being married must be a family member of the deceased, such as a spouse, child, grandchild, parent, or sibling. 2. **The marriage must be registered**: The marriage must be registered in the civil registry, which is usually done within a few days of the death. 3. **The spouse must be the sole surviving partner**: The spouse must be the sole surviving partner of the deceased person, meaning they are the only one left to inherit the spouse's property and carry on the deceased's name. 4. **No remarriage to a non-family member**: The spouse cannot remarry after the death of the deceased, as this would result in a second marriage, which is considered an invalid marriage.  Additionally, the French Civil Code (Loi Civil) provides that the spouse of a deceased person is entitled to the same rights and benefits as if the marriage had been registered in the civil registry, including:  * Inheritance of the deceased person's property * Right to inherit the deceased person's property * Access to the deceased person's family name and surname * Right to participate in the management of the deceased person's estate  It's worth noting that while posthumous marriage is legal, it is not always accepted, and some people may choose not to register the marriage. The French government has also implemented measures to prevent people from marrying their deceased spouse multiple times, such as requiring that the spouse register the marriage separately from the civil registry.  Overall, the French law allows for posthumous marriage, but with certain conditions and limitations, and it is not a common practice due to the complexities and potential complications that can arise from it.	394
1760539846	1760539847	Passage: Saline (medicine) -- Saline, also known as saline solution, is a mixture of sodium chloride in water and has a number of uses in medicine. Applied to the affected area it is used to clean wounds, help remove contact lenses, and help with dry eyes. By injection into a vein it is used to treat dehydration such as from gastroenteritis and diabetic ketoacidosis. It is also used to dilute other medications to be given by injection.  Question: is saline and sodium chloride the same thing  Explain your choice.	No, saline and sodium chloride are not the same thing.  Sodium chloride is a chemical compound consisting of two sodium (Na) and one chloride (Cl) atom, denoted as NaCl. It is the most common form of salt and is found naturally in the Earth's crust.  Saline, on the other hand, is a solution of sodium chloride in water, which is also known as a saline solution. It is a mixture of sodium chloride and water, with a specific concentration of salt. The concentration of sodium chloride in saline can vary depending on the brand and type of solution, but it is typically around 0.9% (9 grams per 100 milliliters).  The key difference between the two is the concentration of sodium chloride in the solution. Sodium chloride is the pure chemical compound, while saline is a solution that contains a mixture of sodium chloride and water.  In the passage, it is mentioned that saline is used to clean wounds, help remove contact lenses, and help with dry eyes, but it is not the sodium chloride itself. Similarly, it is mentioned that saline is used to treat dehydration, but it is not the sodium chloride used to treat dehydration.	242
1760539847	1760539848	Passage: Bubonic plague -- Several classes of antibiotics are effective in treating bubonic plague. These include aminoglycosides such as streptomycin and gentamicin, tetracyclines (especially doxycycline), and the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. Mortality associated with treated cases of bubonic plague is about 1--15%, compared to a mortality of 40--60% in untreated cases.  Question: is there a treatment for the bubonic plague  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, it appears that the treatment for bubonic plague is effective in reducing mortality rates. However, the passage does not mention a specific treatment for the plague itself, but rather highlights the effectiveness of various antibiotics in treating the disease.  Given the information, I would choose to say that there is a treatment for the bubonic plague, but it is not a cure. The passage mentions that treated cases have a mortality rate of about 1-15%, which is significantly lower than the 40-60% mortality rate in untreated cases. This suggests that the treatment is effective in reducing the severity and mortality of the disease.  However, I would note that the passage does not mention any specific treatment for the bubonic plague, only that it is effective in treating the disease.	160
1760539848	1760539848	Passage: Joyce Summers -- The premise of the series is that Buffy is the latest Slayer, a young woman endowed by mystical forces with superhuman powers to fight and defeat vampires, demons, and other evil forces in the fictional town of Sunnydale. Like every Slayer before her, she was chosen and informed of her destiny when she was 15 years old. Her mother is unaware of her daughter's powers and responsibilities until Buffy is forced to tell her at the end of the second season of the television series. Although Joyce is shocked at this revelation, she recovers quickly and remains a source of stability for Buffy and Buffy's small circle of friends who assist her, dubbed the Scooby Gang. Eventually Joyce is able to take Buffy's dangerous demon-fighting in stride and even become proud and respectful of her daughter's abilities. Her natural death from an illness in the fifth season forces Buffy to face becoming an adult.  Question: does buffy's mom know she's a slayer  Explain your choice.	I chose not to include this question in the passage, as it is not relevant to the passage. The passage is primarily focused on Buffy's character development and her relationship with her mother, Joyce, and does not mention her mother's knowledge of Buffy's Slayer status.	54
1760539848	1760539848	Passage: Leaning Tower of Pisa -- The tower's tilt began during construction in the 12th century, caused by an inadequate foundation on ground too soft on one side to properly support the structure's weight. The tilt increased in the decades before the structure was completed in the 14th century. It gradually increased until the structure was stabilized (and the tilt partially corrected) by efforts in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.  Question: was the leaning tower of pisa built leaning  Explain your choice.	My answer is: No, the tower was not built leaning.  The passage states that the tower's tilt began during construction in the 12th century, caused by an inadequate foundation on the ground, which led to its gradual tilt in the decades before its completion in the 14th century. This indicates that the tower's tilt was not a result of the tower itself leaning, but rather the ground it was built on, which was insufficient to support its weight.  In other words, the tower was not intentionally leaning; it was a structural issue caused by the poor foundation.	118
1760539848	1760539849	Passage: Fool's Gold (2008 film) -- Fool's Gold is a 2008 American adventure-romance film from Warner Bros. Pictures about a recently divorced couple who rekindle their romantic life while searching for a lost treasure. The film was directed by Andy Tennant and reunites the How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days stars Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson.  Question: is the movie fool's gold a true story  Explain your choice.	"I would classify the movie ""Fool's Gold"" as a work of fiction, rather than a true story. Here's why:  1. **The plot is fictional**: The story revolves around a couple searching for a lost treasure, which is not based on any real events or people. The plot is entirely fictional and not inspired by any true events. 2. **The characters are not based on real individuals**: The main characters, Dave Berman (Matthew McConaughey) and Audrey (Kate Hudson), are not based on real people. They are fictional characters created to drive the plot forward. 3. **The setting and time period are fictional**: The movie takes place in 2008, but the specific details, including the exact location, are not based on real events or people. 4. **The treasure is not a real treasure**: The treasure is a fictional plot device that serves as a catalyst for the romance between the two main characters. 5. **The tone and themes are not grounded in reality**: The movie has a light-hearted, romantic comedy tone, and its themes of love, friendship, and self-discovery are not based on real-life experiences.  Overall, ""Fool's Gold"" is a work of fiction that uses a unique premise and fictional characters to tell a romantic story, making it a work of fiction rather than a true story."	283
1760539849	1760539851	Passage: Super Bowl curse -- The home field curse affects the host team of the Super Bowl. So far no team has yet managed to reach the Super Bowl in their home stadium. Four teams with Super Bowls in their home venue have qualified for the divisional playoffs: the 1994 Miami Dolphins, the 1998 Miami Dolphins, the 2016 Houston Texans, and the 2017 Minnesota Vikings, the Vikings being the first to qualify for their conference's title game. From 1966--2011 (excluding the six Super Bowl games held in a stadium without a professional team), the Super Bowl host team has had 11 winning seasons, four split seasons, and 25 losing seasons. Mathematically, the probability of that many losing seasons or more occurring by chance (assuming a 50 percent chance of having a losing season (disregarding .500 seasons)) is 7.69 percent. It should be noted, however, that the Super Bowl host stadium is selected several years before the game is played, without regard to the teams that qualify.  Question: has any nfl team played the superbowl at home  Explain your choice.	To determine if any NFL team has played in the Super Bowl at home, let's analyze the information provided:  1. The Super Bowl host team has 11 winning seasons out of 50 years (1966-2011), which means they have played 39 losing seasons. 2. The probability of playing the Super Bowl at home is 11 out of 50, or 22%, which is roughly 0.22.  To find the probability of playing the Super Bowl at home, we can use the binomial distribution. Let's assume that each season is independent and has a 50% chance of being a winning season (loss).  The probability of a winning season is 0.5, and the probability of a losing season is 0.5. We can use the binomial distribution to calculate the probability of playing the Super Bowl at home as follows:  P(playing at home) = P(winning season) * P(losing season) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25  Now, we can use the binomial distribution to find the probability of playing the Super Bowl at home in 11 winning seasons:  P(11 wins in 11 seasons) = (11 choose 11) * (0.5)^11 * (0.5)^0 = 1 * 0.000001 * 1 = 0.001  This is a very small probability, indicating that it is highly unlikely that an NFL team has played in the Super Bowl at home.	318
1760539851	1760539851	Passage: State constitution (Australia) -- In Australia, each state has its own constitution. Each state constitution preceded the Constitution of Australia as constitutions of the then separate British colonies, but all the states ceded powers to the Parliament of Australia as part of federation in 1901.  Question: does each australian state have its own constitution  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, my answer is that yes, each Australian state does have its own constitution.  The passage states that ""Each state constitution preceded the Constitution of Australia as constitutions of the then separate British colonies."" This implies that prior to the 1901 federation, each state had its own constitution, which was in effect before the Australian Constitution was adopted."	74
1760539851	1760539851	Passage: Bundle branch block -- A bundle branch block can be diagnosed when the duration of the QRS complex on the ECG exceeds 120 ms. A right bundle branch block typically causes prolongation of the last part of the QRS complex, and may shift the heart's electrical axis slightly to the right. The ECG will show a terminal R wave in lead V1 and a slurred S wave in lead I. Left bundle branch block widens the entire QRS, and in most cases shifts the heart's electrical axis to the left. The ECG will show a QS or rS complex in lead V1 and a monophasic R wave in lead I. Another normal finding with bundle branch block is appropriate T wave discordance. In other words, the T wave will be deflected opposite the terminal deflection of the QRS complex. Bundle branch block, especially left bundle branch block, can lead to cardiac dyssynchrony. The simultaneous occurrence of left and right bundle branch block leads to total AV block.  Question: can you have a right and left bundle branch block  Explain your choice.	"Based on the information provided, you can have both right and left bundle branch block.  The passage states that ""A bundle branch block typically causes prolongation of the last part of the QRS complex."" This implies that the duration of the QRS complex in both right and left bundle branch blocks can be prolonged.  However, it also mentions that ""A right bundle branch block typically causes prolongation of the last part of the QRS complex"" which suggests that the duration of the QRS complex in right bundle branch block is typically prolonged.  On the other hand, it mentions that ""Left bundle branch block widens the entire QRS, and in most cases shifts the heart's electrical axis to the left."" This implies that the duration of the QRS complex in left bundle branch block is not necessarily prolonged.  Therefore, it is possible for a person to have both right and left bundle branch block, as the duration of the QRS complex in one branch can be prolonged while the duration of the QRS complex in the other branch is not necessarily prolonged."	215
1760539851	1760539852	Passage: Check (chess) -- In informal games, it is customary to announce ``check'' when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check. In formal competitions, however, check is rarely announced.  Question: do you always have to say check in chess  Explain your choice.	"In chess, the answer is generally no, you don't always have to say ""check."" In informal games, it's common for players to make a move and say ""check"" without announcing it. This is because the goal of the game is to be fun and engaging, and the phrase ""check"" can sometimes sound more like a warning or a threat rather than a direct declaration of a check.  In formal competitions, the announcement of ""check"" is often seen as a formal way to signal that the player has put their king in a difficult position and is now in a position to be attacked. However, in casual games, the absence of a formal announcement can help to create a more relaxed and dynamic atmosphere.  That being said, there are some situations where it's perfectly acceptable to say ""check"" in informal games, such as:  * When a player is trying to distract their opponent or throw them off their guard. * When a player is trying to get their opponent to make a mistake or commit to a specific move. * When a player is trying to create a sense of tension or drama in the game.  Ultimately, whether to say ""check"" or not is up to the player's discretion and the specific context of the game."	255
1760539852	1760539853	Passage: Australian Cattle Dog -- The Texas Heeler is a cross between the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Shepherd that was first registered with the Animal Research Foundation (ARF) in 1970. The ARF has registered Australian Cattle Dogs without papers as ``Australian Cattledog Queensland Heelers'' since 1965 and was the first organisation to recognise the Australian Shepherd. Although originally bred for its ability to work cattle, the Texas Heeler is increasingly used as a pet and a companion in dog sports. As with most cross breeds, the Texas Heeler's size and appearance is a variable combination of the parent breeds.  Question: is an australian shepherd the same as an australian cattle dog  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, I would not consider an Australian Shepherd to be the same as an Australian Cattle Dog.  The passage states that the Texas Heeler is a cross between the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Shepherd. This implies that the two breeds are distinct and separate, with the Texas Heeler being a distinct breed.  The passage also notes that Australian Cattle Dogs were originally bred for its ability to work cattle, whereas Australian Shepherds were originally bred for herding sheep. This suggests that the two breeds have different purposes and characteristics.  Furthermore, the passage states that the Texas Heeler's size and appearance is a variable combination of the parent breeds, which implies that it is a crossbreed, rather than a purebred Australian Shepherd.  Overall, while the Texas Heeler may share some physical characteristics with the Australian Shepherd, it is not the same breed.	180
1760539853	1760539854	Passage: Tomato purée -- Tomato purée is a thick liquid made by cooking and straining tomatoes. The difference between tomato paste, tomato purée, and tomato sauce is consistency; tomato puree has a thicker consistency and a deeper flavour than sauce.  Question: is tomato puree and tomato sauce the same thing  Explain your choice.	No, tomato puree and tomato sauce are not the same thing. While they are related, they have distinct differences in terms of consistency and flavor.  Tomato sauce is a thick and intense condiment made by cooking down fresh or canned tomatoes with various ingredients, such as onions, garlic, and herbs, and sometimes tomato paste or tomato puree. The resulting sauce is thick, rich, and often has a robust flavor profile.  Tomato puree, on the other hand, is a thinner, more liquid consistency, often used as a base for sauces, soups, or as a thickening agent. It's typically made by cooking down fresh or canned tomatoes until they break down and release their natural juices, resulting in a smooth, creamy texture.  The key differences between tomato puree and tomato sauce are:  1. **Consistency**: Tomato puree is thicker and more paste-like, while tomato sauce is thinner and more liquid. 2. **Flavor**: Tomato sauce tends to have a more intense, concentrated flavor due to the cooking process, while tomato puree has a milder flavor. 3. **Texture**: Tomato sauce has a more gel-like consistency, while tomato puree is smooth and creamy.  In summary, tomato sauce is a more refined and intense condiment, while tomato puree is a more basic ingredient used as a base or thickening agent.	283
1760539854	1760539855	Passage: The Blues Brothers -- The Blues Brothers are an American blues and soul revivalist band which was founded in 1978 by comedy actors Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi as part of a musical sketch on Saturday Night Live. Belushi and Aykroyd fronted the band, respectively in character as lead vocalist ``Joliet'' Jake Blues and harmonica player/vocalist Elwood Blues. The band was composed of well-known and respected musicians, and debuted as the musical guest on the April 22, 1978, episode of Saturday Night Live, opening the show performing ``Hey Bartender'', and later ``Soul Man''.  Question: is the blues brothers based on a true story  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, it appears that the Blues Brothers are a fictional band, not based on a true story. Here's why:  * The passage mentions that they are a musical sketch on Saturday Night Live, which suggests that they are a comedic creation of the show, rather than a real band. * The fact that they were founded by Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi, two real-life actors and comedians, also implies that they are not based on a true story. * The passage mentions that they debuted as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live, which further supports the idea that they are a fictional band. * The passage also mentions that they were fronted by two well-known musicians, which suggests that they are a fictional band rather than a real one. * The passage does not provide any information about the brothers' real-life backgrounds or personalities, which suggests that they are not based on real individuals.  Overall, the passage presents the Blues Brothers as a fictional band, created for comedic purposes, and not based on a true story.	214
1760539855	1760539855	Passage: Newcastle upon Tyne -- Newcastle upon Tyne (locally /njuːˈkæsəl/ ( listen)), commonly known as Newcastle, is a city in Tyne and Wear, North East England, 103 miles (166 km) south of Edinburgh and 277 miles (446 km) north of London on the northern bank of the River Tyne, 8.5 mi (13.7 km) from the North Sea. Newcastle is the most populous city in the North East, and forms the core of the Tyneside conurbation, the eighth most populous urban area in the United Kingdom. Newcastle is a member of the English Core Cities Group and is a member of the Eurocities network of European cities.  Question: is newcastle upon tyne the same as newcastle  Explain your choice.	"No, Newcastle upon Tyne and Newcastle upon Tyne are not the same. They are two distinct places with different locations, names, and characteristics.  * Newcastle upon Tyne is a city in North East England, while Newcastle upon Tyne is a separate town. * Both share the same name, but the ""upon"" in Newcastle upon Tyne is a prefix that indicates it is a separate entity. * Newcastle upon Tyne is located on the River Tyne, whereas Newcastle is not. * Newcastle upon Tyne is a city with a population of around 300,000, whereas Newcastle is the most populous city in the North East of England.  Therefore, while both places are named after the same river, they are distinct cities with different locations, names, and characteristics."	159
1760539855	1760539856	Passage: Post Office Ltd -- The Post Office provides information on services and accepts postal items and payment on behalf of the two collection and delivery divisions of Royal Mail Group, Royal Mail and Parcelforce. These include a variety of ordinary and guaranteed services both for delivery within the United Kingdom and to international destinations. Postage stamps (including commemorative stamps and other philatelic items) are sold, while applications for redirection of mail are accepted on behalf of Royal Mail.  Question: is post office and royal mail the same  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, it appears that post office and royal mail are not the same, although they are both provided by Royal Mail Group. The passage highlights that:  1. **Different divisions**: The passage mentions that the Post Office is responsible for ""two collection and delivery divisions of Royal Mail Group"", indicating that they are separate entities with different areas of responsibility. 2. **Different services**: The passage lists various services provided by the Post Office, such as postage stamps and redirection of mail, while royal mail is only mentioned as a part of the Royal Mail Group, without specifying its services. 3. **Different ownership**: The passage also notes that ""Royal Mail"" is mentioned as a single entity, implying that it is a separate entity from the Post Office, which is also owned by Royal Mail Group.  Therefore, based on the information provided in the passage, it can be concluded that post office and royal mail are not the same, and they are separate entities within Royal Mail Group."	203
1760539856	1760539857	Passage: Unsuccessful nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States -- Justices are nominated by the president and then confirmed by the U.S. Senate. A nomination to the Court is considered to be official when the Senate receives a signed nomination letter from the president naming the nominee, which is then entered in the Senate's record. There have been 37 unsuccessful nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States. Of these, 11 nominees were rejected in Senate roll-call votes, 11 were withdrawn by the president, and 15 lapsed at the end of a session of Congress. Six of these unsuccessful nominees were subsequently nominated and confirmed to other seats on the Court. Additionally, although confirmed, seven nominees either declined office or (in one instance) died before assuming office.  Question: has any supreme court nominee not been confirmed  Explain your choice.	To determine whether any Supreme Court nominee not confirmed has been confirmed, we need to look at the information given:  1. There have been 37 unsuccessful nominations to the Supreme Court. 2. 11 nominees were rejected in Senate roll-call votes. 3. 15 lapsed at the end of a session of Congress. 4. Six unsuccessful nominees were nominated and confirmed to other seats on the Court. 5. Seven nominees either declined office or died before assuming office.  From these numbers, we can infer that the number of unsuccessful nominations that have been confirmed is 37 - 11 = 26, and the number of unsuccessful nominations that have lapsed is 15.   However, the number of unsuccessful nominees who have been confirmed is also 6, which is the same as the number of unsuccessful nominations that were nominated and confirmed to other seats on the Court.	181
1760539857	1760539857	Passage: Thanksgiving (United States) -- Thanksgiving, or Thanksgiving Day, is a public holiday celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States. It originated as a harvest festival. Thanksgiving has been celebrated nationally on and off since 1789, after Congress requested a proclamation by George Washington. It has been celebrated as a federal holiday every year since 1863, when, during the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a national day of ``Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens,'' to be celebrated on the last Thursday in November. Together with Christmas and the New Year, Thanksgiving is a part of the broader fall/winter holiday season in the U.S.  Question: is thanksgiving always the last thursday of the month  Explain your choice.	"I would choose ""no"" as the answer to the question.   The passage states that Thanksgiving has been celebrated nationally on and off since 1789, but it specifically mentions that it has been celebrated as a federal holiday every year since 1863, when President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a national day of ""Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens"" on the last Thursday in November. This indicates that Thanksgiving is not always the last Thursday of the month, but rather, it is a specific day that has been chosen for its significance and tradition."	122
1760539857	1760539858	Passage: The Lord of the Rings -- The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J.R.R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.  Question: is lord of the rings after the hobbit  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, I chose the word ""after"" instead of ""the"" as the correct word to complete the sentence.  The reason is that ""the"" is a definite article that refers to a specific, previously existing thing, whereas ""after"" is a prepositional phrase that indicates a time or sequence. In this context, ""after the hobbit"" implies a continuation or a sequel, whereas ""the"" would imply a complete entity or a single thing.  So, the correct sentence would be:  ""The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written after The Hobbit.""  This way, ""after"" correctly indicates that The Lord of the Rings is a sequel to The Hobbit, and ""The Hobbit"" is a specific, existing work."	161
1760539858	1760539858	Passage: Fallen (2016 film) -- In December 2014, it was announced that Torment, the second installment in the Fallen book series, was in development. It is unknown whether the last two novels, Passion and Rapture, and the spin-off novel, Unforgiven, will be adapted as well. In 2017, producer Kevan Van Thompson asked the fans if they want an adaptation of ``Torment'', showing that the sequel still could be made.  Question: is the fallen movie going to have a sequel  Explain your choice.	"Based on the information provided, I would say that it is highly likely that the Fallen movie will have a sequel.  The passage mentions that ""it is unknown whether the last two novels, Passion and Rapture, and the spin-off novel, Unforgiven, will be adapted as well"", which implies that the producers are considering adapting all three books. Additionally, in 2017, Kevan Van Thompson asked the fans if they want an adaptation of ""Torment"", indicating that the producers are actively working on adapting the sequel. This suggests that a sequel is in development and is likely to be produced."	124
1760539858	1760539858	Passage: List of most-followed Instagram accounts -- This list contains the top 50 accounts with the most followers on the social photo-sharing platform Instagram. As of October 2018, the most followed user is Instagram's own account, with over 260 million followers. Cristiano Ronaldo is the most followed individual, with over 144 million followers. Twelve accounts have exceeded 100 million followers on the site.  Question: does anyone on instagram have 1 billion followers  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, we can see that as of October 2018, the most followed user on Instagram is Cristiano Ronaldo, with over 144 million followers. This suggests that as of 2018, there were no accounts with 1 billion followers on Instagram.	55
1760539858	1760539859	Passage: Padmé Amidala -- George Lucas, Rick McCallum, and casting director Robin Gurland auditioned over 200 actresses for the part of Padmé Amidala. They chose 16-year-old actress Natalie Portman to play the role. According to The Phantom Menace production notes, ``The role required a young woman who could be believable as the ruler of that planet, but at the same time be vulnerable and open.'' Portman's performances in The Professional (1994) and Beautiful Girls (1996) impressed Lucas. He stated, ``I was looking for someone who was young, strong, along the lines of Leia. Natalie embodied all those traits and more.''  Question: in the phantom menace is padme the queen  Explain your choice.	"The passage suggests that the choice of Natalie Portman as Padmé Amidala in the film ""The Phantom Menace"" was based on her ability to embody the qualities of the character.  Padmé Amidala is described as a queen who is young, strong, and vulnerable. The passage states that Natalie Portman's performances in films like ""The Professional"" and ""Beautiful Girls"" showcased these qualities, and that George Lucas chose her for the role because she embodied them.  In ""The Phantom Menace,"" Padmé is portrayed as a strong and capable leader, but also as a vulnerable and open individual. Natalie Portman's performance in ""The Professional"" shows her ability to play a strong and independent character, and her performance in ""Beautiful Girls"" suggests that she could convey the emotional depth and vulnerability that is required for Padmé.  Lucas chose Natalie Portman for the role because she was able to capture the complex and multifaceted nature of Padmé, and he believed that she would be able to bring a youthful energy and strength to the character, while also conveying the emotional depth and vulnerability that is necessary for the role."	230
1760539859	1760539860	Passage: The Lord of the Rings -- The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J.R.R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.  Question: is lord of the rings considered an epic  Explain your choice.	"I would classify ""The Lord of the Rings"" as an epic fantasy novel. Here's why:  1. **Scale**: The book is a massive work, consisting of three volumes (The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King) that together form a single narrative. Epic epics typically have a vast scope, exploring complex themes, and encompassing multiple storylines. 2. **High fantasy setting**: The Lord of the Rings is set in Middle-earth, a fictional world with its own geography, history, and cultures. This is a common trait of epic fantasy, which often features imaginary worlds with detailed and expansive settings. 3. **Hero's journey**: The story follows the quest of a group of characters, including Frodo Baggins, the main protagonist, as they embark on a perilous journey to destroy the One Ring. This narrative structure is reminiscent of the hero's journey, a classic trope found in many epic stories, including Homer's Iliad and Odyssey. 4. **Themes and symbolism**: The Lord of the Rings explores complex themes, such as friendship, sacrifice, and the struggle between good and evil. These themes are typical of epic fantasy, which often grapple with deeper, universal questions about human nature and the nature of the world. 5. **Length and complexity**: The book's length and complexity are also hallmarks of epic fiction. The novel's intricate world-building, detailed character development, and multi-layered plot make it a rich and immersive reading experience.  While other works, such as The Hobbit, may also be classified as epics, ""The Lord of the Rings"" stands out for its massive scope, high fantasy setting, and exploration of complex themes, making it a quintessential epic fantasy novel."	366
1760539860	1760539861	Passage: Euro sign -- The euro sign (€) is the currency sign used for the euro, the official currency of the Eurozone in the European Union (EU). The design was presented to the public by the European Commission on 12 December 1996. The international three-letter code (according to ISO standard ISO 4217) for the euro is EUR. In Unicode it is encoded at U+20AC € euro sign (HTML &#8364; &euro; ). In English, the sign precedes the value (for instance, €10, not 10 €, unlike most other European languages). In some style guides, but not others, the euro sign is unspaced.  Question: does the euro sign go before the number  Explain your choice.	"In the given passage, the euro sign (€) precedes the value, so my answer is ""yes"".   The reason for this is that the European Commission presented the euro sign to the public on December 12, 1996, and it is the first element of the symbol for the euro, followed by the word ""euro"". Therefore, the euro sign precedes the word ""euro""."	84
1760539861	1760539861	Passage: Induction cooking -- For nearly all models of induction cooktops, a cooking vessel must be made of, or contain, a ferrous metal such as cast iron or some stainless steels. The iron in the pot concentrates the current to produce heat in the metal. If the metal is too thin, or does not provide enough resistance to current flow, heating will not be effective. Most induction tops will not heat copper or aluminum vessels because the magnetic field cannot produce a concentrated current; ``all metal'' induction tops use much higher frequencies to overcome that effect. Any vessel can be used if placed on a suitable metal disk which functions as a conventional hotplate.  Question: can stainless steel be used on induction cooktop  Explain your choice.	"The passage states that most induction cooktops require a ferrous metal, such as cast iron or stainless steels, to produce heat due to the magnetic field required to concentrate the current. However, it also mentions that ""all metal"" induction tops use higher frequencies to overcome the effect of the magnetic field on non-ferrous metals like copper and aluminum.  Given this information, the passage implies that stainless steel can be used on induction cooktops because it is a ferrous metal that can be used."	104
1760539861	1760539862	Passage: Dismissal (employment) -- ``Firing'' is a common colloquial term in the English language (particularly used in the U.S.) for termination. The term ``firing'' may have been initiated in the 1910s at the National Cash Register Company. Other terms for dismissal are being ``sacked'', ``canned'', ``let go'', ``ran-off'', ``axed'', ``given walking papers'', ``given the pink slip'' or ``boned''. Other terms, more often used in Commonwealth countries, include ``to get the boot'' and ``to get the sack''.  Question: is job termination the same as being fired  Explain your choice.	"No, job termination and being fired are not exactly the same. While both terms refer to the act of ending a job, there are subtle differences in their origins, usage, and connotations.  Termination typically refers to the formal process of ending an employment contract, usually due to a specific reason such as resignation, termination of performance, or disciplinary action. It is often used in formal or official contexts, such as in employment contracts, employment law, or disciplinary proceedings.  On the other hand, ""firing"" is a colloquial term that is more informal and often used in everyday language. It can have a more negative connotation and may imply a more abrupt or dramatic ending, as in the case of a firing by a company. In informal settings, ""firing"" might be used to describe a sudden, unexpected, or dramatic departure, whereas termination is typically used to describe a more structured process.  Other terms like ""sacked"", ""canned"", ""axed"", ""given walking papers"", ""given the pink slip"", and ""boned"" are more specific and specific terms that have their own unique meanings and connotations. For example, ""sacked"" might imply a more severe or severe termination, while ""given the pink slip"" is a more common term used in the United States to refer to a notice of termination, often given to an employee as part of a formal process.  In summary, while both termination and firing are used to end employment, they have distinct differences in their origins, usage, and connotations. Termination is a more formal and structured process, whereas firing is a more informal and colloquial term that implies a more dramatic or abrupt ending."	345
1760539862	1760539863	Passage: Inattentional blindness -- In a 2015 study, Cary Stothart, Walter Boot, and Daniel Simons attempted to replicate and extend the findings from both Graham and Burke's 2011 study and Steven Most and colleague's 2000 study on Amazon Mechanical Turk using a sample of 515 participants that varied in age. In this study, participants were tasked with counting the number of times a number of white moving objects crossed the vertical midpoint of a display while ignoring a number of black moving objects. The unexpected object in this case was a gray cross that moved horizontally across the display at various distances from the vertical midpoint (this was manipulated between participants). Overall, they found that inattentional blindness susceptibility increases with age, which replicates the finding from Graham and Burke. In fact, they found that every 10 years of age was associated with a 1.3 fold increase in the probability of displaying inattentional blindness. They also found that the probability of inattentional blindness increases as the distance between the observer's focus of attention and the unexpected object increases, which replicates the finding from Most and colleagues. However, they also found that the relationship that age has with inattentional blindness does not change as a function of the unexpected object's distance from the focus of attention, suggesting that useful field of view does not mediate the relationship between age and inattentional blindness.  Question: does age have any influence on attentional ability or inattentional blindness  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, the author's choice is that age does not have a significant influence on attentional ability or inattentional blindness. The passage states that the relationship between age and inattentional blindness does not change as a function of the unexpected object's distance from the focus of attention, suggesting that useful field of view does not mediate the relationship between age and inattentional blindness. This implies that the presence of an object at any distance from the focus of attention does not affect the susceptibility to inattentional blindness, regardless of age.  The author also mentions that the study found that inattentional blindness increases with age, but this increase is not necessarily due to a decrease in attentional ability, but rather due to an increase in the probability of the unexpected object being in the focus of attention. This suggests that age-related changes in attentional ability may be more related to the presence of an object at any distance from the focus of attention rather than the age itself.	198
1760539863	1760539864	Passage: Sanskrit -- Sanskrit belongs to the Indo-European family of languages. It is one of the three ancient documented languages that likely arose from a common root language now referred to as the Proto-Indo-European language:  Question: is sanskrit the first language of the world  Explain your choice.	"While Sanskrit is indeed an ancient and influential language, the claim that it is the ""first language of the world"" is a matter of debate among scholars.  Sanskrit is one of the three ancient Indo-European languages, which are considered to be the foundation of the Indo-European language family. The other two languages are Latin and Greek. These three languages are believed to have originated from a common ancestral language, known as Proto-Indo-European.  The concept of a single ""first language"" of the world is a complex and debated topic among linguists. Some argue that the Indo-European languages, including Sanskrit, are too diverse and complex to be considered as a single, unifying language. They point out that languages have evolved over time through a process of linguistic drift, divergence, and assimilation, which has resulted in the development of distinct dialects and languages.  Additionally, the idea of a single, universal language is also challenged by the existence of many other languages that have been spoken throughout human history, such as Sumerian, Chinese, Arabic, and many others. These languages have distinct grammatical structures, vocabularies, and writing systems that set them apart from Sanskrit.  Furthermore, the concept of a single ""first language"" also raises questions about the nature of language and its role in human culture and society. While Sanskrit has had a profound impact on Western civilization, its influence on other cultures and languages is limited, and it is not considered to be the language of the ""original"" or ""first"" language of the world.  In conclusion, while Sanskrit is an ancient and influential language, the idea of it being the ""first language of the world"" is a matter of debate among scholars. The complex and diverse nature of languages, the evolution of languages, and the existence of other languages with their own distinct characteristics all suggest that a single, universal language is unlikely to exist."	389
1760539864	1760539865	Passage: Jack Russell Terrier -- The Jack Russell Terrier is a small terrier that has its origins in fox hunting. It is principally white-bodied and smooth, rough or broken-coated but can be any colour.  Question: is a jack russell considered a small breed  Explain your choice.	"Based on the given information, I would classify the Jack Russell Terrier as a small breed.  Although the passage mentions that the Jack Russell Terrier is ""principally white-bodied"" and ""smooth or broken-coated"", I chose to consider it as a small breed based on the fact that it is described as ""small"" in general, rather than ""medium"" or ""large"". The term ""small"" is a general term that encompasses a range of sizes, but in the context of dog breeds, it typically refers to breeds that weigh between 10-18 pounds (4.5-8 kg) and stand between 10-15 inches (25-38 cm) tall at the shoulder.  So, while the Jack Russell Terrier may not be extremely small, it is generally considered a small breed due to its compact size and weight."	174
1760539865	1760539866	Passage: Air Force One -- The Air Force usually does not have fighter aircraft escort the presidential aircraft over the United States but it has occurred, for example during the attack on the World Trade Center.  Question: does air force one travel with fighter escort  Explain your choice.	In the case of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, Air Force One, the presidential plane carrying President George W. Bush, did indeed fly with a fighter escort. This was a unique decision made by the U.S. military to ensure the safety of the president and the passengers.  This decision was likely made due to the high-profile nature of the attack and the potential for the plane to be targeted by enemy forces. The hijackers had already attempted to take control of the plane, and the military believed that the Air Force One would provide a high level of security.  Additionally, the presence of fighter aircraft in the skies around the United States was also a response to the 9/11 attacks, and the military wanted to demonstrate its ability to respond to such an event. By escorting the Air Force One, the military aimed to show that it could take decisive action to protect the president and the American people.  In general, Air Force One is typically flown by a high-level Air Force officer or a senior military officer, and it is not typically accompanied by fighter aircraft. However, in the context of the 9/11 attacks, the decision to fly the Air Force One with fighter escort was made to ensure the safety of the president and the passengers, and to demonstrate the military's readiness to respond to a high-level threat.	276
1760539866	1760539867	Passage: AR-15s in California -- The Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989 banned Colt AR-15 rifles by name in the State of California. California's 2000 Assault Weapons ban went further and banned AR-15s made by other manufacturers by name such as Bushmaster, PWA, and Olympic Arms.  Question: is it legal to own an ar15 in california  Explain your choice.	Based on the information provided, it appears that owning an AR-15 in California is still legal, but with some caveats.  The passage states that California banned the sale and possession of AR-15s by name in 1989, but it doesn't explicitly state that it's still banned. However, it also mentions that California's 2000 Assault Weapons ban went further and banned AR-15s made by other manufacturers by name.  This suggests that California's 2000 Assault Weapons ban, which was enacted in 2000, is still in effect, and it prohibits the possession of AR-15s made by other manufacturers by name. This means that:  * You can still buy an AR-15 from a private seller in California. * You can own an AR-15 that was manufactured by a California-licensed manufacturer, such as Colt, but not those manufactured by companies like Bushmaster or PWA. * You cannot sell an AR-15 in California.  However, the 2000 Assault Weapons ban does not explicitly prohibit the ownership of AR-15s made by other manufacturers by name, so it is still legal to own one.	238
1760539867	1760539867	Passage: The Star-Spangled Banner -- ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' is the national anthem of the United States. The lyrics come from ``Defence of Fort M'Henry'', a poem written on September 14, 1814, by the then 35-year-old lawyer and amateur poet Francis Scott Key after witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry by British ships of the Royal Navy in Baltimore Harbor during the Battle of Baltimore in the War of 1812. Key was inspired by the large U.S. flag, with 15 stars and 15 stripes, known as the Star-Spangled Banner, flying triumphantly above the fort during the U.S. victory.  Question: is the national anthem and star spangled banner the same  Explain your choice.	"No, the national anthem and the Star-Spangled Banner are not the same. While both are related to the United States and have patriotic significance, they are distinct in their origins and meanings.  The national anthem is ""The Star-Spangled Banner"", which was written by Francis Scott Key in 1814 after witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry by British ships. The lyrics describe the U.S. victory and the flag flying triumphantly above the fort.  The Star-Spangled Banner, on the other hand, is the song that is sung as the national anthem of the United States. It was adopted as the national anthem in 1931, after a contest where ""My Country, 'Tis of Thee"" was chosen as the winner. The song is set to a popular melody of ""To Anacreon in Heaven"" and was written by John Stafford Smith.  While both are patriotic and celebrate American heritage, they have different origins, meanings, and melodies."	201
1760539867	1760539868	Passage: Naples International Airport -- Naples International Airport (IATA: NAP, ICAO: LIRN) (Italian: Aeroporto Internazionale di Napoli) is the international airport serving Naples, Italy. It is located 3.2 NM (5.9 km; 3.7 mi) north-northeast of the city in the Capodichino district of Naples. The airport has two terminal buildings: Terminal 1 is for scheduled flights and Terminal 2, located away from the airfield, is used for charter operations.  Question: is there an international airport in naples italy  Explain your choice.	"Yes, there is an international airport in Naples, Italy. The correct information is:  Naples International Airport (IATA: NAP, ICAO: LIRN) (Italian: Aeroporto Internazionale di Napoli) is the international airport serving Naples, Italy.   I chose the correct answer because it explicitly states ""international airport"" in the passage, indicating that it is a facility that caters to international flights. The other information in the passage only confirms that it is located in Naples, Italy, but does not provide further details about its international status."	116
1760539868	1760539868	Passage: Cadbury Creme Egg -- Creme eggs are available annually between 1 January and Easter Day. In the UK in the 1980s, Cadbury made Creme Eggs available year-round but sales dropped and they returned to seasonal availability.  Question: can you buy cadburys creme eggs all year round  Explain your choice.	I can explain why Cadbury Creme Eggs are available year-round in the UK, not all year round.  My choice is based on the following information:  * The passage states that Cadbury Creme Eggs are available between 1 January and Easter Day in the UK. * The passage also mentions that in the 1980s, Cadbury made Creme Eggs available year-round. * However, the passage does not explicitly state that they are available all year round.  Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the passage is incorrect, and Cadbury Creme Eggs are not available all year round.	127
1760539868	1760539869	Passage: Homologous chromosome -- A couple of homologous chromosomes, or homologs, are a set of one maternal and one paternal chromosome that pair up with each other inside a cell during meiosis. Homologs have the same genes in the same loci where they provide points along each chromosome which enable a pair of chromosomes to align correctly with each other before separating during meiosis. This is the basis for Mendelian inheritance which characterizes inheritance patterns of genetic material from an organism to its offspring parent developmental cell at the given time and area.  Question: do homologous chromosomes carry information for the same traits  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, my answer is:  No, homologous chromosomes do not carry information for the same traits.  The passage states that homologous chromosomes ""have the same genes in the same loci"" where they provide points along each chromosome. This implies that homologous chromosomes carry the same genes, but the genes are not necessarily the same type or have the same function. The passage also mentions that homologous chromosomes are involved in Mendelian inheritance patterns, which suggests that they carry genetic information that can be passed down from one generation to the next, but the specific traits associated with each chromosome are not specified."	129
1760539869	1760539869	Passage: Michigan Wolverines football -- Michigan began competing in intercollegiate football in 1879. The Wolverines joined the Big Ten Conference at its inception in 1896, and other than a hiatus from 1907 to 1916, have been members since. Michigan has won or shared 42 league titles, and, since the inception of the AP Poll in 1936, has finished in the top 10 a total of 38 times. The Wolverines claim 11 national championships, most recently that of the 1997 squad voted atop the final AP Poll.  Question: has michigan ever won a national championship in football  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, I would choose that Michigan has not won a national championship in football.  The passage states that the Wolverines have won or shared 42 league titles, but it does not mention a national championship. The only national championships mentioned are 11, which are from the AP Poll, not from the official NCAA championships.	69
1760539869	1760539870	Passage: Waiter Rule -- The Waiter Rule refers to a common belief that one's true character can be gleaned from how one treats staff or service workers, such as a ``waiter''. The rule was one of William H Swanson's 33 Unwritten Rules of Management, copied from Dave Barry's version ``If someone is nice to you but rude to the waiter, they are not a nice person.''  Question: you can tell a lot about a person by how they treat their waiter  Explain your choice.	"The passage suggests that the Waiter Rule, also known as the ""Waiter Rule"" or ""William H. Swanson's 33 Unwritten Rules of Management,"" is a common belief that one's character can be inferred from how they treat staff, specifically a waiter. However, I would argue that this rule is not entirely accurate.  While a person's behavior towards a waiter can give some insight into their character, it is not a reliable indicator of their overall character. Here's why:  1. **Context matters**: A person's behavior towards a waiter can be influenced by their circumstances, such as the type of establishment, the time of day, and the specific situation. A waiter's behavior may be more nuanced and context-dependent than a general rule. 2. **Individual differences**: People have unique personalities, values, and communication styles that can affect how they interact with others, including their colleagues. What one person finds annoying or unacceptable, another person may not, and vice versa. 3. **Social norms and expectations**: The Waiter Rule is based on a social norm that a person should treat their waiter with respect and kindness, but it does not account for the specific norms and expectations of the workplace. What is considered polite or respectful in a workplace may not be the same in a different context. 4. **Lack of research support**: There is limited research to support the idea that a person's behavior towards a waiter is a reliable indicator of their character. In fact, studies on personality and workplace behavior have shown that there is no direct correlation between a person's behavior towards colleagues and their overall character. 5. **Diversity and complexity**: Human behavior is complex and multifaceted, and a single behavior towards a waiter may not reveal a person's entire character. A person may be kind and respectful to a waiter in a specific situation, but still be rude or uncooperative in others.  In conclusion, while a person's behavior towards a waiter may give some insight into their character, it is not a reliable indicator. A more accurate assessment of a person's character should consider their overall behavior, values, and interactions with others in various contexts."	443
1760539870	1760539871	Passage: American crocodile -- Within the United States, the American crocodile's distribution is limited to the southern tip of Florida, though at least two have been found as far north as the Tampa Bay area. The current US population, estimated at 2,000, represents a significant recovery from a few hundred in the 1970s.  Question: are there any crocodiles native to north america  Explain your choice.	There are no crocodiles native to North America. The passage mentions that American crocodiles are only found in the southern tip of Florida, which is part of the southeastern United States.   Crocodiles are a species that are native to Africa and Asia, and they are not found in the wild in North America. The American alligator, on the other hand, is a different species that is native to North America.	87
1760539871	1760539871	Passage: Lex Luthor (Smallville) -- Season seven displayed Lex's descent into darkness; he has a brother-like relationship with Grant Gabriel (Michael Cassidy), the new editor of the Daily Planet newest editor, until it's revealed Grant is actually a clone of Lex's late brother. After Lex buys the Daily Planet, Grant attempts to keep Lex from being controlling, thus Lex has his brother's clone murdered and staged as a failed mugging. Lex then discovers that the previous symbols are connected to the secret organization Veritas, which his father is a part of. The Veritas members learned that an alien visitor known as ``The Traveler'' would arrive in Smallville during the meteor shower of 1989. At this time, Lex realizes that Lionel has been covering up the Traveler's existence and subsequently kills his own father for it. He eventually discovers that the Veritas members knew of a means to control the Traveler, so Lex sets out to find the device. The device, an orb he finds in the mantle above a fireplace in the Luthor mansion, leads Lex to the Fortress of Solitude, where he is confronted by Clark. Having finally discovered Clark's secret, Lex uses the orb to bring down the Fortress around Clark and himself.  Question: does lex luthor know who superman is in smallville  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, it can be inferred that Lex Luthor does not know who Superman is in Smallville. Here's why:  The passage mentions Lex's brother Grant Gabriel, who is revealed to be a clone of Lex's late brother, but there is no mention of Superman. In fact, the passage explicitly states that the previous symbols are connected to the secret organization Veritas, which is associated with Superman, but there is no connection to Lex Luthor.	95
1760539871	1760539872	Passage: Admission to the bar in the United States -- In the canonical case, lawyers seeking admission must earn a Juris Doctor degree from a law school approved by the jurisdiction, and then pass a bar exam administered by it. Typically, there is also a character and fitness evaluation, which includes a background check. However, there are exceptions to each of these requirements. A lawyer who is admitted in one state is not automatically allowed to practice in any other. Some states have reciprocal agreements that allow attorneys from other states to practice without sitting for another full bar exam; such agreements differ significantly among the states.  Question: do you have to have a college degree to take the bar exam  Explain your choice.	No, you do not have to have a college degree to take the bar exam. In the United States, the primary requirement to take the bar exam is to earn a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from a law school that is approved by the jurisdiction where you wish to practice. However, there are some exceptions to this rule.  There are a few possible reasons why a lawyer might be admitted to the bar without a college degree:  1. **Jurisdictional requirements**: Some states have specific requirements for admission to the bar that do not include a college degree. For example, a lawyer from a state that is part of the United States' uniform judicial system may be admitted to the bar without a college degree. 2. **Reciprocity agreements**: As mentioned in the passage, some states have reciprocal agreements that allow attorneys from other states to practice without sitting for another full bar exam. These agreements can vary significantly from state to state, so it's essential to check with the relevant state bar association to determine if a college degree is not required. 3. **Other qualifications**: In some cases, a college degree may not be required, but other qualifications, such as a law degree from an American Bar Association (ABA)-accredited law school, may be sufficient to qualify a lawyer to practice in another state. 4. **Limited admission**: In some states, a college degree may be sufficient for limited admission to the bar, such as in certain jurisdictions where a law degree from an ABA-accredited law school is sufficient.  In summary, while a college degree is typically required to take the bar exam in the United States, there are exceptions to this rule, and the specific requirements vary from state to state.	352
1760539872	1760539873	Passage: Iron Fist (season 2) -- The second season of the American web television series Iron Fist, which is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, follows Danny Rand / Iron Fist, a martial arts expert with the ability to call upon the power of the Iron Fist. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films and other television series of the franchise. The season is produced by Marvel Television in association with ABC Studios, with Raven Metzner serving as showrunner.  Question: will there be a season 2 of marvel's iron fist  Explain your choice.	Based on the information provided, it appears that Marvel's Iron Fist is currently a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and is set to continue in Season 3, not Season 2. However, I can still provide an explanation for the choice.  My choice is based on the following factors:  1. **Marvel's Cinematic Universe (MCU) continuity**: Marvel has consistently produced a new season of Iron Fist after each Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film. This suggests that the show is expected to continue in the MCU. 2. **Shared continuity with other Marvel series**: Iron Fist is set to share continuity with other Marvel series, including the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), which implies that the show is connected to the larger MCU. 3. **Showrunner**: The showrunner, Raven Metzner, is associated with ABC Studios, which is the production company behind Marvel's other MCU projects. This further supports the idea that Iron Fist is part of the MCU.  While there is no official confirmation on a Season 2, the current production status and shared continuity with the MCU make it likely that the show will continue in Season 3.	245
1760539873	1760539873	Passage: Toll-free telephone numbers in the North American Numbering Plan -- In the United States of America, Canada, and other countries participating in the North American Numbering Plan, a toll-free telephone number has one of the area codes 800, 833, 844, 855, 866, 877, and 888.  Question: is 844 a toll free number in canada  Explain your choice.	Based on the North American Numbering Plan, the answer is no, 844 is not a toll-free number in Canada.  The reason is that the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) defines toll-free numbers as those with area codes 800, 877, 866, or 855. Since 844 does not fall into this category, it is not considered a toll-free number in Canada.  In Canada, the North American Numbering Plan defines toll-free numbers as those with area codes 800, 877, 866, 855, 877X (where X can be 1, 2, or 3), and 800 (also known as 1-800).	146
1760539873	1760539874	Passage: Daylight saving time by country -- Most areas in North America and Europe, and some areas in the Middle East, observe daylight saving time (DST), while most areas of Africa and Asia do not. In South America, most countries in the north of the continent near the equator do not observe DST, while Paraguay and southern parts of Brazil do. The practice of observing daylight saving time in Oceania is also mixed, with New Zealand and parts of southeastern Australia observing DST, while most other areas do not.  Question: does any other country have daylight savings time  Explain your choice.	The passage does not mention any other country besides the ones mentioned (North America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia, South America, and Oceania) that observe daylight saving time (DST).	42
1760539874	1760539874	Passage: Johnny Vander Meer -- John Samuel Vander Meer (November 2, 1914 -- October 6, 1997) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a pitcher, most notably for the Cincinnati Reds. Vander Meer is best known for being the only pitcher in Major League Baseball history to throw two consecutive no-hitters. After the impressive start to his major league career, he experienced problems controlling the accuracy of his pitching, and his later career was marked by inconsistent performances.  Question: has anyone ever pitched back to back no hitters  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, I would choose the following answer: Yes, someone has pitched back-to-back no-hitters in Major League Baseball history.  My reasoning is as follows:  - The passage mentions that Vander Meer threw two consecutive no-hitters, which is the only instance mentioned in the passage. - There is no mention of anyone pitching back-to-back no-hitters after Vander Meer's career. - The passage does mention that Vander Meer experienced problems controlling the accuracy of his pitching in his later career, but it does not specifically state that he pitched back-to-back no-hitters in his later career.  Therefore, the correct answer is ""yes"", as there is at least one instance of someone pitching back-to-back no-hitters in Major League Baseball history, which is Vander Meer."	160
1760539874	1760539874	Passage: Black Bike Week -- Black Bike Week, also called Atlantic Beach Bikefest and Black Bikers Week, is an annual motorcycle rally in the Myrtle Beach, South Carolina area, held on Memorial Day weekend. It is also sometimes called Black Fill-in-the-Blank Week, because it has evolved to attract many non-motorcycling visitors who come for music, socializing and enjoying the beach. Events include motorcycle racing, concerts, parties, and street festivals. Called a ``one-of-a-kind event'' and ``an exhibitionist's paradise'' by Jeffrey Gettleman, Black Bike Week is ``all about riding, styling and profiling,'' in the words of Mayor Irene Armstrong of Atlantic Beach, South Carolina.  Question: is there a black bike week in myrtle beach  Explain your choice.	"I chose to replace the blank in the passage with ""Black"" to answer the question ""is there a Black Bike Week in Myrtle Beach."" The passage is describing Black Bike Week as an annual motorcycle rally, so it's reasonable to infer that it is indeed a Black Bike Week. The passage mentions ""Black Bike Week"" as a name, and the tone and content suggest that it's a motorcycle event."	83
1760539874	1760539875	Passage: Static (DC Comics) -- It was recently revealed that prior to his abduction, Static teamed with Justice League member Black Lightning in order to stop former Blood Syndicate member Holocaust, who had tried to kill the superhero while he was acting as the keynote speaker at Ernest Hemingway High's senior graduation.  Question: are static shock and black lightning the same person  Explain your choice.	In the DC Comics universe, Static and Black Lightning are two distinct characters with different powers and backgrounds.  Static (Virgil Hawkins) is a teenager with the ability to generate and control electromagnetic energy, which he uses to fly, project force fields, and create energy blasts. He is a member of the Teen Titans and later became a founding member of the superhero team known as The New Teen Titans.  Black Lightning (Lynn Wright) is a superhero who gained his powers after being exposed to a meteorite that had been imbued with the energy of a lightning bolt. He uses his powers to fight crime and protect his community as a member of the Justice League and later as a solo hero.  In the passage you provided, there is no indication that Static and Black Lightning are the same person. The passage states that they teamed up to stop Holocaust, a former Blood Syndicate member, before his abduction. This suggests that Holocaust is a separate character, not Static or Black Lightning.	199
1760539875	1760539876	Passage: Unbreakable glass -- Unbreakable glass is glass, or glass substitute, which does not display the normal fragility of glass - in general the term is not used to refer to something that is absolutely unbreakable.  Question: is there such a thing as unbreakable glass  Explain your choice.	"The passage suggests that ""unbreakable glass"" is not a real thing, and instead proposes a more accurate description of glass as ""glass substitute"" that is not fragile.  My response is that ""unbreakable glass"" is not a valid or accurate term. While glass is an incredibly strong and durable material, it is not entirely unbreakable. While it is extremely resistant to shattering and can withstand significant impacts, it is still subject to breaking under extreme forces.  However, the passage does propose a more accurate alternative: ""glass substitute"" or ""crystal."" These terms are used to describe materials that mimic the properties of glass but are not made from glass itself. Some examples of glass substitutes include boron carbide, silicon carbide, and zirconium dioxide. These materials are made from different elements and have distinct properties that make them stronger and more resistant to breaking than glass.  In contrast, unbreakable glass would imply that these substitutes are entirely indestructible, which is not the case."	208
1760539876	1760539877	Passage: Liquid latex -- As the latex dries it becomes very sticky and will stick to itself if accidentally folded over. Most manufacturers offer a slick spray for latex once it is dry to take away the stickiness allowing the movement of the model's limbs. Alternatively, shimmer powders can be dusted over dried liquid latex to create metallic effects. One advantage to the tackiness of liquid latex is that it can act as an adhesive to attach things to the paint, such as zippers.  Question: can liquid latex be used as an adhesive  Explain your choice.	Liquid latex can be used as an adhesive, but it has some limitations. The sticky properties of liquid latex can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it can act as a strong adhesive to attach small objects, such as zippers, to the model's limbs. However, on the other hand, the sticky properties of liquid latex can also make it difficult to remove without damaging the surrounding material, such as paint or other adhesives.  In general, I would say that liquid latex is best suited for applications where a strong adhesive is required, but not a permanent one. If you need a temporary or reversible adhesive, liquid latex might be a good option. However, if you need a strong adhesive that can withstand repeated use, you may want to consider alternative adhesives.  Additionally, the use of liquid latex as an adhesive can be messy and difficult to clean up, which may not be desirable for some projects. It's always a good idea to test a small, inconspicuous area before applying liquid latex to a larger surface to ensure that it doesn't damage the material.	224
1760539877	1760539878	Passage: Gun laws in Texas -- Gov. Perry also signed H.B. 1815 after passage by the 2007 Legislature, a bill that allows any Texas resident to carry a handgun in the resident's motor vehicle without a CHL or other permit. The bill revised Chapter 46, Section 2 of the Penal Code to state that it is in fact not ``Unlawful Carry of a Weapon'', as defined by the statute, for a person to carry a handgun while in a motor vehicle they own or control, or to carry while heading directly from the person's home to that car. However, lawful carry while in a vehicle requires these four critical qualifiers: (1) the weapon must not be in plain sight (in Texas law, ``plain sight'' and ``concealed'' are mutually exclusive opposing terms); (2) the carrier cannot be involved in criminal activities, other than Class C traffic misdemeanors; (3) the carrier cannot be prohibited by state or federal law from possessing a firearm; and (4) the carrier cannot be a member of a criminal gang.  Question: is it illegal to carry a pistol in your car in texas  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, it is not necessarily illegal to carry a pistol in your car in Texas, as long as it meets the four critical qualifiers outlined in the passage. Here's why:  1. **The weapon must not be in plain sight**: This means the pistol is not visible to others, which is a crucial qualifier. As long as the pistol is not visible, it's not considered ""in plain sight"". 2. **The carrier cannot be involved in criminal activities**: This means the person carrying the pistol is not engaging in any illegal activities, such as being involved in a crime or being a member of a gang. 3. **The carrier cannot be prohibited by state or federal law from possessing a firearm**: This means the person does not have a prior conviction or law enforcement record that would prevent them from owning and carrying a pistol. 4. **The carrier cannot be a member of a criminal gang**: This means the person is not affiliated with a gang, which is another qualifier that prevents them from being prohibited by law.  However, the passage does mention that carrying a handgun in a vehicle is still considered ""unlawful carry"" if the person is not meeting the other two qualifiers, such as being involved in a crime or being prohibited from possessing a firearm."	262
1760539878	1760539878	Passage: Sgian-dubh -- When worn as part of the national dress of Scotland, the sgian-dubh is legal in Scotland, England and Wales. In Scotland under the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 Sec. 49, Sub-sec. 5(c); in England and Wales, under the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (section 139) and the Offensive Weapons Act 1996 (section 4).  Question: is it legal to carry a sgian dubh  Explain your choice.	Based on the information provided, it appears that carrying a sgian dubh in Scotland is legal, while in England and Wales, it is not.   This is because the sgian dubh is specifically mentioned in Scotland under the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 and the Criminal Justice Act 1988, which are Scottish laws. These laws have precedence over the Offensive Weapons Act 1996, which is a UK-wide law.  In England and Wales, the Offensive Weapons Act 1996 and the Criminal Justice Act 1988 have been repealed, and their provisions have been replaced by the Policing and Crime Act 2009, which states that carrying a knife or other bladed article in a public place is not an offense, as long as it is not used to cause fear of violence.  Therefore, based on this information, it can be concluded that carrying a sgian dubh in Scotland is legal, while carrying it in England and Wales is not.	204
1760539878	1760539879	Passage: Hypoglossal nerve -- The hypoglossal nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve, and innervates all the extrinsic and intrinsic muscles of the tongue, except for the palatoglossus which is innervated by the vagus nerve. It is a nerve with a solely motor function. The nerve arises from the hypoglossal nucleus in the brain stem as a number of small rootlets, passes through the hypoglossal canal and down through the neck, and eventually passes up again over the tongue muscles it supplies into the tongue. There are two hypoglossal nerves in the body: one on the left, and one on the right.  Question: several cranial nerves innervate structures of the tongue  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, I would choose the following structures:  1. Palatoglossus - The passage states that the palatoglossus is innervated by the vagus nerve, not the hypoglossal nerve. So, I would not choose the palatoglossus. 2. Hypoglossal muscle - The passage states that the hypoglossal nerve innervates all the extrinsic and intrinsic muscles of the tongue, except for the palatoglossus. Therefore, I would choose the hypoglossal muscle.  The correct answer is the hypoglossal muscle.	130
1760539879	1760539879	Passage: Puerto Rico -- Puerto Rico (Spanish for ``Rich Port''), officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (Spanish: Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, lit. ``Free Associated State of Puerto Rico'') and briefly called Porto Rico, is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea.  Question: is porto rico a part of the united states  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, I would choose ""yes"" as the answer to the question ""is Port of Rico a part of the United States.""  This is because the passage states that Puerto Rico is ""an unincorporated territory of the United States."" This indicates that it is not a sovereign country but rather a territory that is under the jurisdiction of the United States government."	77
1760539879	1760539880	Passage: Sales taxes in the United States -- Washington has a 6.50% statewide sales tax. Local rates vary based on an individual's location at the point of purchase and can total up to 3.10% for a combined rate of 9.60%. In addition, due to the large number of Native American sovereign nations located within the state, sales-tax rates, if any, can vary based on state treaties with each nation.  Question: is there sales tax in the state of washington  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, I would conclude that there is a sales tax in the state of Washington. Here's why:  1. The passage states that ""Washington has a 6.50% statewide sales tax"". This indicates that sales tax is a mandatory tax levied on the purchase of goods and services within the state. 2. The passage also mentions that local rates vary based on an individual's location, but it does not mention that there is no sales tax at the local level. This suggests that the state sales tax is the primary source of revenue for the state government. 3. There is no mention of a separate state sales tax rate that is separate from the 6.50% statewide rate. This implies that the 6.50% rate is the standard rate for all transactions within the state, and local rates are subject to the 3.10% combined rate for a maximum rate of 9.60%.  Therefore, based on these points, I conclude that sales tax is indeed present in the state of Washington."	214
