1760465984	1760465984	Passage: Persian language -- Persian (/ˈpɜːrʒən, -ʃən/), also known by its endonym Farsi (فارسی fārsi (fɒːɾˈsiː) ( listen)), is one of the Western Iranian languages within the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family. It is primarily spoken in Iran, Afghanistan (officially known as Dari since 1958), and Tajikistan (officially known as Tajiki since the Soviet era), and some other regions which historically were Persianate societies and considered part of Greater Iran. It is written in the Persian alphabet, a modified variant of the Arabic script, which itself evolved from the Aramaic alphabet.  Question: do iran and afghanistan speak the same language  Explain your choice.	"I would say that Iran and Afghanistan do not speak the same language.  The passage states that Iran and Afghanistan are ""officially known as Dari since 1958"", indicating that Dari is an official language in both countries, but it does not imply that they are the same language. In fact, it is mentioned that ""some other regions"" considered part of Greater Iran also spoke Persian, suggesting that there are other regions where Persian is spoken, not just Iran and Afghanistan."	98
1760465984	1760465985	Passage: Good Samaritan law -- Good Samaritan laws offer legal protection to people who give reasonable assistance to those who are, or who they believe to be, injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. The protection is intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, for fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. An example of such a law in common-law areas of Canada: a good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing. Its purpose is to keep people from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in treatment. By contrast, a duty to rescue law requires people to offer assistance and holds those who fail to do so liable.  Question: do good samaritan laws protect those who help at an accident  Explain your choice.	I would argue that good Samaritan laws do not protect those who help at an accident.   Good Samaritan laws provide protection to individuals who provide assistance to those in distress, as long as their actions are reasonable and not intentionally harmful. However, they do not absolve individuals from liability for any harm or injury that may result from their actions. In fact, the laws typically provide a clear distinction between the duties of a good Samaritan and a duty to rescue. The good Samaritan doctrine, which is a key component of good Samaritan laws, explicitly states that a rescuer who has provided assistance is not liable for any harm or injury that may result from their actions.  This means that if someone helps someone in distress, such as calling for emergency services or providing basic first aid, they can be held liable for any harm or injury they may cause to the victim if they fail to follow proper medical procedures or provide adequate care.  In contrast, duty to rescue laws, as mentioned in the passage, require individuals to offer assistance and hold those who fail to do so liable for any harm or injury that may result from their actions. This means that if someone fails to rescue someone in distress, they may be held responsible for any harm or injury they cause, even if they provided reasonable assistance.  Therefore, good Samaritan laws do not protect those who help at an accident; they actually increase the liability for those who fail to provide proper care or rescue.	294
1760465985	1760465986	Passage: Windows Movie Maker -- Windows Movie Maker (formerly known as Windows Live Movie Maker in Windows 7) is a discontinued video editing software by Microsoft. It is a part of Windows Essentials software suite and offers the ability to create and edit videos as well as to publish them on OneDrive, Facebook, Vimeo, YouTube, and Flickr.  Question: is windows movie maker part of windows essentials  Explain your choice.	My choice is incorrect.  Windows Movie Maker is actually part of Windows Essentials, not Windows Movie Maker. Windows Movie Maker is a video editing software that was included in the Windows Essentials software suite, but it is no longer available for download or purchase.	51
1760465986	1760465986	Passage: Powdered sugar -- Powdered sugar, also called confectioners' sugar, icing sugar, and icing cake, is a finely ground sugar produced by milling granulated sugar into a powdered state. It usually contains a small amount of anti-caking agent to prevent clumping and improve flow. Although most often produced in a factory, powdered sugar can also be made by processing ordinary granulated sugar in a coffee grinder, or by crushing it by hand in a mortar and pestle.  Question: is confectionary sugar the same as powdered sugar  Explain your choice.	No, confectionary sugar and powdered sugar are not the same.   While both terms refer to finely ground sugar, the main difference lies in their production process.   Confectionary sugar, also known as icing sugar or icing cake, is produced by milling granulated sugar into a powdered state using a machine. This process involves grinding the sugar into a fine powder, which is then sifted and purified to remove any impurities.  Powdered sugar, on the other hand, can be made by processing ordinary granulated sugar in a coffee grinder, or by crushing it by hand in a mortar and pestle. The grinding process is typically more labor-intensive and may not produce the same level of purity as confectionary sugar. Additionally, powdered sugar may contain a small amount of anti-caking agent to prevent clumping, which is not typically found in confectionary sugar.  Therefore, while both terms refer to finely ground sugar, confectionary sugar is generally considered to be a more refined and pure form of sugar, whereas powdered sugar may have a coarser texture and may contain additives.	222
1760465986	1760465987	Passage: The Elder Scrolls Online -- As with other games in The Elder Scrolls series, the game is set on the continent of Tamriel. The events of the game occur a millennium before those of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and around 800 years before The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. It has a broadly similar structure to Skyrim, with two separate conflicts progressing at the same time, one with the fate of the world in the balance, and one where the prize is supreme power on Tamriel. In The Elder Scrolls Online, the first struggle is against the Daedric Prince Molag Bal, who is attempting to meld the plane of Mundus with his realm of Coldharbour, and the second is to capture the vacant imperial throne, contested by three alliances of the mortal races. The player character has been sacrificed to Molag Bal, and Molag Bal has stolen their soul, the recovery of which is the primary game objective.  Question: is elder scrolls online the same as skyrim  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, here's why I think Elder Scrolls Online is not the same as Skyrim:  1. **Setting**: While both games are set in the Elder Scrolls universe, they are set in different times and locations. The passage mentions that the events of Elder Scrolls Online occur around 800 years before Skyrim, and that the continent of Tamriel is the same in both games. In contrast, Skyrim takes place in the province of Skyrim, a different location within Tamriel.  2. **Plot**: The passage describes two separate conflicts: one with the fate of the world in the balance and another where the prize is supreme power on Tamriel. In Skyrim, the primary conflict is between the Dragonborn and Alduin the World-Eater, while in Elder Scrolls Online, the primary conflict is against the Daedric Prince Molag Bal and the struggle for the vacant imperial throne.  3. **Plot objective**: The passage states that the player character has been sacrificed to Molag Bal and that the recovery of their soul is the primary objective. This is not mentioned in Skyrim, where the player character is not sacrificed or has their soul stolen.  4. **Gameplay mechanics**: The passage does not mention any gameplay mechanics that are specific to Skyrim, such as the Dunmer (Dark Elf) culture, the Aldmeri Dominion, or the unique features of the game's world and mechanics.  In summary, while both games are set in the Elder Scrolls universe, they are distinct games with different settings, plots, and gameplay mechanics.	317
1760465987	1760465988	Passage: Epsom railway station -- Epsom railway station serves the town of Epsom in Surrey. It is located off Waterloo Road and is less than two minutes' walk from the High Street. It is not in the London Oyster card zone unlike Epsom Downs or Tattenham Corner stations. The station building was replaced in 2012/2013 with a new building with apartments above the station (see end of article).  Question: can you use oyster card at epsom station  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, I can see that Epsom station does not accept Oyster cards. It is mentioned that ""It is not in the London Oyster card zone unlike Epsom Downs or Tattenham Corner stations."""	48
1760465988	1760465988	Passage: Da Vinci's Demons -- The series premiered in the United States on Starz on 12 April 2013, and its second season premiered on 22 March 2014. The series was renewed for a third season, which premiered on 24 October 2015. On 23 July 2015, Starz announced that the third season would be the show's last. However Goyer has left it open for a miniseries return.  Question: will there be a season 4 of da vinci's demons  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, it appears that Da Vinci's Demons has not been renewed for a fourth season. The passage states that the third season was the show's last, and it mentions that Goyer left the show, which likely contributed to the decision to end the series.	57
1760465988	1760465989	Passage: Federal judiciary of the United States -- The federal courts are composed of three levels of courts. The Supreme Court of the United States is the court of last resort. It is generally an appellate court that operates under discretionary review, which means that the Court can choose which cases to hear, by granting writs of certiorari. There is therefore generally no basic right of appeal that extends automatically all the way to the Supreme Court. In a few situations (like lawsuits between state governments or some cases between the federal government and a state) it sits as a court of original jurisdiction.  Question: is the federal court the same as the supreme court  Explain your choice.	No, the federal court is not the same as the Supreme Court of the United States.  The Supreme Court of the United States is a unique institution within the federal judiciary that has the final say in certain cases, while the other two levels of federal courts (the Courts of Appeal and the District Courts) have different roles and levels of authority.  The Courts of Appeal, also known as the federal courts of appeal, are appellate courts that hear appeals from the District Courts. They review decisions made by the District Courts to ensure that they are within the bounds of the law. They do not have the power to grant writs of certiorari, which is the power of the Supreme Court to review cases and decide whether they are worthy of review.  The District Courts, on the other hand, are trial courts that hear cases from the beginning. They are the courts that the general public interacts with when they go to court.  The main difference between the Supreme Court of the United States and the other two levels of federal courts is that the Supreme Court is the highest court in the land, and it has the final say in the interpretation of the law. It can hear cases that involve the Constitution, federal statutes, and the Constitution of the United States, and it can decide the constitutionality of laws.	263
1760465989	1760465989	Passage: Bixby letter -- In the 1998 war film Saving Private Ryan, General George Marshall (played by Harve Presnell) reads the Bixby letter to his officers before giving the order to find and send home Private James Francis Ryan after Ryan's three brothers died in battle.  Question: did abraham lincoln write the letter in saving private ryan  Explain your choice.	"I can help you analyze the passage.  The passage does not mention Abraham Lincoln at all. It mentions General George Marshall, who was the Chief of Staff of the United States Army during World War II.  The passage actually quotes a Bixby letter, which is a reference to the story ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" by Erich Maria Remarque, not ""Saving Private Ryan"".   In the book, the story revolves around a soldier's experiences during World War I, not World War II."	105
1760465989	1760465990	Passage: Batman & Robin (film) -- With the box office success of Batman Forever in June 1995, Warner Bros. immediately commissioned a sequel. They hired director Joel Schumacher and writer Akiva Goldsman to reprise their duties the following August, and decided it was best to fast track production for a June 1997 target release date, which is a break from the usual 3-year gap between films. Schumacher wanted to homage both the broad camp style of the 1960s television series and the work of Dick Sprang. The storyline of Batman & Robin was conceived by Schumacher and Goldsman during pre-production on A Time to Kill. Portions of Mr. Freeze's back-story were based on the Batman: The Animated Series episode ``Heart of Ice'', written by Paul Dini.  Question: is batman and robin a sequel to batman forever  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, it can be concluded that Batman & Robin is not a direct sequel to Batman Forever. Here's why:  * The passage mentions that the sequel was commissioned immediately after the success of Batman Forever, but it does not state that it was a sequel to the previous film. Instead, it states that it was a reprise of their duties for the following August. * The passage also states that the story was conceived by Joel Schumacher and Akiva Goldsman during pre-production on A Time to Kill, which suggests that the storyline is a new origin story for Batman, rather than a direct continuation of the events of Batman Forever. * The passage also mentions that portions of Mr. Freeze's back-story were based on a specific episode from Batman: The Animated Series, but it does not imply that Batman & Robin was a sequel to Batman Forever.  Therefore, it appears that Batman & Robin is a new origin story for Batman, rather than a sequel to Batman Forever.	201
1760465990	1760465990	Passage: Badger -- Badgers are short-legged omnivores in the family Mustelidae, which also includes the otters, polecats, weasels, and wolverines. They belong to the caniform suborder of carnivoran mammals. The 11 species of badgers are grouped in three subfamilies: Melinae (Eurasian badgers), Mellivorinae (the honey badger or ratel), and Taxideinae (the American badger). The Asiatic stink badgers of the genus Mydaus were formerly included within Melinae (and thus Mustelidae), but recent genetic evidence indicates these are actually members of the skunk family, placing them in the taxonomic family Mephitidae.  Question: is a wolverine the same as a badger  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, wolverines and badgers are not the same. Although they are both members of the same family (Mustelidae), wolverines belong to a different subfamily (Taxideinae) and are not part of the subfamily Melinae (Eurasian badgers). They are also not part of the genus Mydaus, which is the genus that includes the Asiatic stink badgers.  The passage specifically mentions that the Asiatic stink badgers were formerly included within Melinae (and thus Mustelidae), but recent genetic evidence indicates that they are actually members of the skunk family (Mephitidae). This suggests that wolverines are not part of the same subfamily as badgers.	153
1760465990	1760465991	Passage: Green Lantern (film) -- Green Lantern was released on June 17, 2011, and received generally negative reviews; most criticized the film for its screenplay, inconsistent tone, choice and portrayal of villains, and its use of CGI, while some praised Reynolds' performance. Reynolds would later voice his dissatisfaction with the film. The film underperformed at the box office, grossing $219 million against a production budget of $200 million. Due to the film's negative reception and disappointing box office performance, Warner Bros. canceled any plans for a sequel, instead opting to reboot the character in the DC Extended Universe line with the film Green Lantern Corps, set for release in 2020.  Question: will there be a green lantern 2 movie  Explain your choice.	Based on the given passage, it appears that there will not be a Green Lantern 2 movie. The passage states that Warner Bros. canceled plans for a sequel due to the negative reception of the first film, which grossed a relatively low amount of money at the box office.	57
1760465991	1760465992	Passage: United States and the International Criminal Court -- The United States should have the chance to observe and assess the functioning of the court, over time, before choosing to become subject to its jurisdiction. Given these concerns, I will not, and do not recommend that my successor, submit the treaty to the Senate for advice and consent until our fundamental concerns are satisfied.  Question: does the icc has jurisdiction in the united states  Explain your choice.	This passage is related to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the United States' stance on its jurisdiction.  The passage suggests that the United States should observe and assess the functioning of the ICC over time before deciding to become a subject of its jurisdiction. This is a cautious approach, and here's why:  1. **Concerns about jurisdiction**: The passage mentions the concerns of the speaker regarding the ICC's jurisdiction in the United States. This suggests that the speaker is worried about the potential for the ICC to exert jurisdiction over U.S. citizens or territories, which could raise concerns about national sovereignty and individual rights.  2. **Observation and assessment**: The speaker wants the ICC to observe and assess the court's functioning in the United States over time before considering whether to become a subject of its jurisdiction. This implies that the speaker is seeking to understand the court's capabilities, its procedures, and its impact on the country before making a decision.  3. **Not recommending submission**: The passage explicitly states that the speaker does not recommend that the treaty be submitted to the Senate for advice and consent until these concerns are satisfied. This suggests that the speaker is hesitant to take a firm stance on the ICC's jurisdiction in the United States, at least for now.  Considering these points, it appears that the speaker is choosing a cautious approach, weighing the potential risks and benefits of becoming a subject of the ICC's jurisdiction. This suggests that the speaker is considering the long-term implications of the ICC's expansion and is taking a thoughtful and measured approach to making a decision.	319
1760465992	1760465992	Passage: Calcium carbide -- Calcium carbide is a chemical compound with the chemical formula of CaC. Its main use industrially is in the production of acetylene and calcium cyanamide.  Question: calcium carbide cac2 is the raw material for the production of acetylene  Explain your choice.	The passage states that calcium carbide is the raw material for the production of acetylene.   In chemistry, acetylene is a highly reactive gas with the chemical formula C2H2. It is often produced industrially through the reaction of calcium carbide (CaC2) with an acid, such as sulfuric acid, in the presence of a catalyst.   Calcium carbide is not directly used to produce acetylene, but rather serves as a precursor to acetylene. To produce acetylene, calcium carbide is reacted with sulfuric acid to produce calcium sulfate, which is then decomposed to produce calcium oxide and hydrogen gas (H2). The hydrogen gas can then be used to produce acetylene through the reaction with a catalyst.  Therefore, calcium carbide is a crucial intermediate in the production of acetylene, rather than the raw material itself.	181
1760465992	1760465993	Passage: Now You See Me (film series) -- Now You See Me is a series of heist thriller film written by Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin, and Edward Ricourt. They focus on the actions of a team of illusionists named ``The Four Horsemen'' who pull off near impossible heists. The series features an ensemble cast including Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Michael Caine, Lizzy Caplan, and Morgan Freeman. The first film was released in 2013, while the second was released in 2016, and a third film is currently in development and set to be released in 2019. The series has received mixed reviews from critics and audiences and grossed nearly $700 million worldwide.  Question: is there a now you see me 3 coming out  Explain your choice.	"Based on the information provided, I conclude that there is no indication that the ""Now You See Me"" film series is currently in development for a third installment. The passage mentions that a third film is currently in development and set to be released in 2019, but it does not confirm whether it will be released before the second film or after it.  In fact, the passage mentions that the second film was released in 2016, which implies that the third film is likely to be released after 2016, rather than before it.  Therefore, my choice is that there is no now you see me 3 coming out."	130
1760465993	1760465993	Passage: Penalty shoot-out (association football) -- A shoot-out is usually considered for statistical purposes to be separate from the match which preceded it. In the case of a two-legged fixture, the two matches are still considered either as two draws or as one win and one loss; in the case of a single match, it is still considered as a draw. This contrasts with a fixture won in extra time, where the score at the end of normal time is superseded. Converted shoot-out penalties are not considered as goals scored by a player for the purposes of their individual records, or for ``golden boot'' competitions.  Question: does a penalty shoot out goal count towards the golden boot  Explain your choice.	"I'm happy to help you with your question. However, I must point out that the passage does not mention the ""golden boot"" competition at all. The passage only talks about penalty shoot-outs in association football.  In general, in football, a penalty shoot-out is used as a tiebreaker in case of a goalless draw, and it is not related to the ""golden boot"" competition. The golden boot is a separate competition that recognizes the top scorer in a tournament or competition.  Therefore, a penalty shoot-out goal does not count towards the golden boot competition."	117
1760465993	1760465993	Passage: Cutthroat Kitchen -- Cutthroat Kitchen is a cooking show hosted by Alton Brown that aired on the Food Network from August 11, 2013 to July 19, 2017. It features four chefs competing in a three-round elimination cooking competition. The contestants face auctions in which they can purchase opportunities to sabotage one another. Each chef is given $25,000 at the start of the show; the person left standing keeps whatever money they have not spent in the auctions. The show ended on its fifteenth season in July 2017. The series shares some basic elements with other four-chef, three-round elimination-style competitions on Food Network including Chopped and Guy's Grocery Games. Numerous Cutthroat Kitchen contestants have competed on these shows.  Question: will there be a new season of cutthroat kitchen  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, it appears that there will not be a new season of Cutthroat Kitchen. The passage mentions that the show ended on its fifteenth season in July 2017, and the last episode was filmed before that.	48
1760465993	1760465994	Passage: Jack Sikma -- In 2006, Sikma was voted as one of the 100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament, a group of former players and coaches in honor of the 100 anniversary of the IHSA boys basketball tournament. On June 27, 2017, Sikma was inducted into the Small College Basketball Hall of Fame as part of their second class . Inducted alongside Sikma were Zelmo Beaty, Walt Frazier, Bob Love, Elmore Smith, Jim Spivey, Rico Swanson, George Tinsley, and Al Tucker.  Question: is jack sikma in the hall of fame  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, I choose that Jack Sikma is in the Hall of Fame.   The passage states that he was ""inducted alongside"" a group of other players, which implies that he is one of the individuals being honored, not the inductee himself. Additionally, the passage mentions that he is part of the ""second class"" being inducted, which suggests that he is one of the newer members of the Hall of Fame."	92
1760465994	1760465995	Passage: Half-elven -- In J.R.R. Tolkien's fictional universe of Middle-earth, the Half-elven (Sindarin singular Peredhel, plural Peredhil, Quenya singular Perelda) are the children of the union of Elves and Men. Of these, the most significant were the products of couplings between the Eldar (the Elves who followed the Call to Valinor) and the Edain (the Men of the Three Houses of early Men who allied themselves with the Eldar in their war against Morgoth).  Question: can elves and humans mate lord of the rings  Explain your choice.	"Based on Tolkien's works, I would argue that in his fictional universe of Middle-earth, elves and humans can indeed mate and produce offspring. This is evident from various sources, including:  1. The fact that the children of elven-human unions are referred to as ""Half-Elves"" (Sindarin: Peredhel, Quenya: Peredhil) in Tolkien's writings. This suggests a common ancestry and a shared heritage between the two species. 2. The mention of ""the Edain"" (plural of Edain) as the products of couplings between elves and men, which implies a blending of the two species' genetic material. 3. The concept of the Two Trees of Valinor, which were said to have been planted by the Elves to preserve their genetic legacy and ensure the continuation of their species. This implies a deep connection between the Elves and the Edain, and potentially even between the Elves and humans.  While Tolkien did not explicitly state that elves and humans can mate, it is clear that the boundaries between the two species are not as rigid as they might be in our own world. The concept of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, which is set in Middle-earth, suggests a world where such unions between humans and elves are not uncommon.  It's worth noting that Tolkien's works often blurred the lines between the two species, and his depiction of the relationship between elves and men is often nuanced and complex. However, based on the available evidence, it appears that elves and humans can indeed mate and produce offspring in his fictional universe."	326
1760465995	1760465996	Passage: The Boy in the Plastic Bubble -- The Boy in the Plastic Bubble is a 1976 American made-for-television drama film inspired by the lives of David Vetter and Ted DeVita, who lacked effective immune systems. It stars John Travolta, Glynnis O'Connor, Diana Hyland, Robert Reed, Ralph Bellamy & P.J. Soles. It was written by Douglas Day Stewart, executive produced by Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg (who, at the time, produced Starsky and Hutch and Charlie's Angels), and directed by Randal Kleiser, who would work with Travolta again in Grease shortly after. The original music score was composed by Mark Snow. The theme song ``What Would They Say'' was written and sung by Paul Williams. William Howard Taft High School in Woodland Hills was used for filming.  Question: the boy in the plastic bubble based on true story  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, I believe the boy in the plastic bubble is David Vetter, a 5-year-old boy who was born in 1971 with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a rare genetic disorder that affects the immune system. He was left with a severely compromised immune system and required a special plastic bubble-like enclosure to protect him from contracting infections.  My reasoning is as follows:  1. The passage mentions that the story is inspired by the lives of David Vetter and Ted DeVita, who lacked effective immune systems. This suggests that the film is based on real-life individuals who were affected by SCID. 2. The film stars John Travolta, Glynnis O'Connor, Diana Hyland, Robert Reed, Ralph Bellamy, and P.J. Soles, which lists some of the actors who played real-life individuals with SCID. 3. The film was written by Douglas Day Stewart, who also worked on other projects such as Starsky and Hutch and Charlie's Angels, which suggests that he had experience working with stories about individuals with rare diseases. 4. The film's director, Randal Kleiser, who worked with Travolta in Grease, also had experience with films about people with disabilities.  Overall, the passage suggests that the boy in the plastic bubble is based on David Vetter, a real-life individual with SCID, and that the film is inspired by the lives of individuals who were affected by this condition.	302
1760465996	1760465997	Passage: A priori and a posteriori -- These terms are used with respect to reasoning (epistemology) to distinguish ``necessary conclusions from first premises'' (i.e., what must come before sense observation) from ``conclusions based on sense observation'' (which must follow it). Thus, the two kinds of knowledge, justification, or argument, may be glossed:  Question: science begins with the premise that knowledge should first be acquired through observation  Explain your choice.	I'd be happy to explain.  The passage highlights the distinction between a priori and a posteriori knowledge. The key points are:  - A priori knowledge is acquired through reasoning without reference to sense observation. - A posteriori knowledge is acquired through sense observation.  In the context of the passage, the first part states that science begins with the premise that knowledge should be acquired through observation. This suggests that scientific knowledge is derived from sense observation, which is a fundamental aspect of a priori knowledge. This premise is necessary to establish the foundation of scientific inquiry.  To break it down further:  - A priori knowledge refers to knowledge that is independent of experience, which is acquired through reasoning or reflection alone. In the context of science, this would involve theoretical reasoning and deduction, rather than empirical observation. - A posteriori knowledge, on the other hand, refers to knowledge that is derived from experience or observation. In the context of science, this would involve the collection of data and evidence from observations, which are essential for understanding the natural world.  Therefore, the passage is suggesting that science begins with a priori reasoning, establishing the foundation of scientific knowledge, whereas a posteriori knowledge is acquired through sense observation, which is essential for further refinement and validation of scientific theories.	261
1760465997	1760465997	Passage: Tim Brown (American football) -- Timothy Donell Brown (born July 22, 1966) is a former American football wide receiver who played professionally in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Notre Dame, where he won the Heisman Trophy, becoming the first wide receiver to win the award. He spent sixteen years with the Los Angeles/Oakland Raiders, during which he established himself as one of the NFL's most prolific wide receivers. Brown has also played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In 2015, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  Question: is tim brown in the hall of fame  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, my choice to answer ""yes"" to the question ""is Tim Brown in the Hall of Fame"" is correct.  The passage explicitly states that Tim Brown was ""inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame"" in 2015, which is a clear indication that he is indeed a member of the Hall of Fame."	72
1760465997	1760465997	Passage: Drinking in public -- Drinking in public in Denmark is legal in general. The law forbids ``disturbing of the public law and order''. Thus general consumption is accepted. Several cafes have outdoor serving in the same zones.  Question: can you drink alcohol in public in denmark  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, I would choose to drink in public in Denmark. The passage states that ""drinking in public is legal"" in Denmark, which suggests that it is widely accepted and permitted to consume alcohol in public spaces. Additionally, it mentions that ""general consumption is accepted"", implying that it is not only allowed but also encouraged."	69
1760465997	1760465998	Passage: Jersey pound -- Both Jersey and Bank of England notes are legal tender in Jersey and circulate together, alongside the Guernsey pound and Scottish banknotes. The Jersey notes are not legal tender in the United Kingdom but are legal currency, so creditors and traders may accept them if they so choose.  Question: is jersey currency legal tender in the uk  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, the answer is no, Jersey currency (Jersey pound) is not legal tender in the United Kingdom. The passage states that Jersey notes are ""not legal tender in the United Kingdom"", which implies that they are not recognized as a valid form of payment in the UK.  The passage also states that Jersey notes are ""legal currency"" in Jersey, which suggests that they are a legitimate and widely accepted form of currency in the island, but not in the UK.  Therefore, the correct answer is that Jersey currency (Jersey pound) is not legal tender in the United Kingdom."	123
1760465998	1760465998	Passage: Milwaukee Bucks -- The Bucks have won one league title (1971), two conference titles (1971 and 1974), and 13 division titles (1971--1974, 1976, 1980--1986, 2001). They have featured such notable players as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Sidney Moncrief, Oscar Robertson, Bob Dandridge, Bob Lanier, Glenn Robinson, Ray Allen, Sam Cassell, Junior Bridgeman, Michael Redd, Terry Cummings, Vin Baker, Jon McGlocklin, Marques Johnson, and Brian Winters.  Question: have the milwaukee bucks ever won a championship  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, I would choose that the Milwaukee Bucks have not won a championship. The passage lists 13 division titles and two conference titles, but does not mention any championships won by the team.	42
1760465998	1760465998	Passage: List of FIFA World Cup penalty shoot-outs -- This is a list of all penalty shoot-outs that have occurred in the Finals tournament of the FIFA World Cup. Penalty shoot-outs were introduced as tie-breakers in the 1978 World Cup but did not occur before 1982. The first time a World Cup title was won by penalty shoot-out was in 1994. The only other time was in 2006. By the end of the 2018 edition, 30 shoot-outs have taken place in the World Cup. Of these, only two reached the sudden death stage after still being tied at the end of ``best of five kicks''.  Question: does the world cup final go to penalties  Explain your choice.	"I choose the statement ""Does the World Cup final go to penalties"" as the correct answer.  The passage states that penalty shoot-outs were introduced as tie-breakers in the 1978 World Cup and that only two times have they reached the sudden death stage after still being tied at the end of the ""best of five kicks"". This implies that in only two instances, the World Cup final has gone to penalties."	85
1760465998	1760465999	Passage: Kingdom (manga) -- Kingdom (キングダム, Kingudamu) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yasuhisa Hara (原泰久, Hara Yasuhisa). The manga provides a fictionalized account of the Warring States period primarily through the experiences of the war orphan Xin and his comrades as he fights to become the greatest general under the heavens, and in doing so, unifying China for the first time in history. The series was adapted into a thirty-eight episode anime series by studio Pierrot that aired from June 4, 2012 to February 25, 2013. A second season was announced and aired from June 8, 2013 to March 1, 2014. An English language release of the anime was licensed by Funimation.  Question: is kingdom manga based on a true story  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, I would say that the Kingdom manga is not based on a true story. Here's why:  1. **Exaggerated and fictionalized account**: The passage states that the series is a ""fictionalized account"", which implies that the story is not based on real events or people. The manga is a work of fiction, and the characters and events are fictionalized to create a narrative. 2. **War or historical period**: The passage mentions the ""War of the Warring States period"", which is a historical event, but the manga takes creative liberties with the events to create a fictional story. The war is portrayed as a struggle for power and unification, rather than a realistic portrayal of the actual conflict. 3. **Fictional characters and plot**: The manga follows the story of a war orphan, Xin, as he fights to become the greatest general. The characters and their personalities, motivations, and actions are not based on real historical figures or events. The story is entirely fictional. 4. **Contextualized to a specific time period**: The passage also mentions that the manga is set during the Warring States period, but it's unlikely that the story is based on specific historical events or figures from that time. The manga is more likely a work of fantasy or historical fiction, rather than a historical drama.  Overall, based on the information provided in the passage, it's clear that Kingdom is a work of fiction, rather than a true story."	307
1760465999	1760466000	Passage: European Economic Area -- As of 2014 the contracting parties to the EEA are 3 of the 4 EFTA member states and 27 of the 28 EU member states. The 28th and newest EU member, Croatia, finished negotiating their accession to the EEA in November 2013, and since 12 April 2014 is provisionally applying the agreement pending its ratification by all EEA member states.  Question: is croatia part of the european economic area  Explain your choice.	Based on the information provided, I would say that Croatia is not part of the European Economic Area (EEA) as of 2014.  Although Croatia completed the accession negotiations and signed an agreement with the EU in November 2013, it has not yet ratified the agreement and applied it to its internal policies, which is a necessary step for Croatia to become a full member of the EEA.  The EEA Agreement requires that the country must ratify the agreement before it can apply it to its internal policies, which is why it is still pending ratification by all EEA member states.  Therefore, as of 2014, Croatia is not considered a member of the European Economic Area.	143
1760466000	1760466000	Passage: Posthumous marriage -- Posthumous marriage (or necrogamy) is a marriage in which one of the participating members is deceased. It is legal in France and similar forms are practiced in Sudan and China. Since World War I, France has had hundreds of requests each year, of which many have been accepted.  Question: can u marry a dead person in france  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, it appears that in France, posthumous marriage is legal, but with certain conditions.  The passage states that ""it is legal in France and similar forms are practiced in Sudan and China."" This suggests that while the specific laws and regulations surrounding posthumous marriage are unique to France, the concept of posthumous marriage itself is allowed.  However, it also notes that ""many have been accepted"" in France, implying that the practice is widely accepted and accepted by the French authorities. This suggests that the French government and society at large do not have a strong opposition to posthumous marriage.  In contrast, the passage notes that in Sudan and China, similar forms of posthumous marriage are practiced, but it does not imply that these practices are widely accepted in France. This suggests that the French government may have stricter laws and regulations governing posthumous marriage than in Sudan and China.  Overall, based on the passage, it appears that posthumous marriage is allowed in France, but the specific laws and regulations surrounding the practice are not as lenient as in Sudan and China."	227
1760466000	1760466001	Passage: Saline (medicine) -- Saline, also known as saline solution, is a mixture of sodium chloride in water and has a number of uses in medicine. Applied to the affected area it is used to clean wounds, help remove contact lenses, and help with dry eyes. By injection into a vein it is used to treat dehydration such as from gastroenteritis and diabetic ketoacidosis. It is also used to dilute other medications to be given by injection.  Question: is saline and sodium chloride the same thing  Explain your choice.	"Saline and sodium chloride are not exactly the same thing, although they are often used together in medical contexts.   Sodium chloride, also known as sodium chloride or common salt, is a naturally occurring mineral compound with the chemical formula NaCl, composed of sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl). It is a crystalline solid that is commonly found in nature and is used in various applications, including food, manufacturing, and pharmaceuticals.  Saline, on the other hand, refers to a solution of sodium chloride in water, specifically a solution with a concentration of 0.9% (9 grams per liter) or 3.5% (35 grams per liter). The term ""saline"" can also refer to other types of solutions containing sodium chloride, such as 0.45% (45 grams per liter) or 0.1% (10 grams per liter).  While the solution is the same as sodium chloride, the term ""saline"" typically implies a specific concentration of sodium chloride in water, whereas ""sodium chloride"" refers to the compound itself. In medical contexts, the term ""saline"" is often used to describe a solution that contains sodium chloride in a specific concentration, whereas ""sodium chloride"" is the compound itself."	257
1760466001	1760466002	Passage: Bubonic plague -- Several classes of antibiotics are effective in treating bubonic plague. These include aminoglycosides such as streptomycin and gentamicin, tetracyclines (especially doxycycline), and the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. Mortality associated with treated cases of bubonic plague is about 1--15%, compared to a mortality of 40--60% in untreated cases.  Question: is there a treatment for the bubonic plague  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, the answer is no, there is no treatment for bubonic plague. The passage states that the mortality rate for treated cases of bubonic plague is about 1-15%, which is significantly lower than the mortality rate for untreated cases, which is around 40-60%.	61
1760466002	1760466002	Passage: Joyce Summers -- The premise of the series is that Buffy is the latest Slayer, a young woman endowed by mystical forces with superhuman powers to fight and defeat vampires, demons, and other evil forces in the fictional town of Sunnydale. Like every Slayer before her, she was chosen and informed of her destiny when she was 15 years old. Her mother is unaware of her daughter's powers and responsibilities until Buffy is forced to tell her at the end of the second season of the television series. Although Joyce is shocked at this revelation, she recovers quickly and remains a source of stability for Buffy and Buffy's small circle of friends who assist her, dubbed the Scooby Gang. Eventually Joyce is able to take Buffy's dangerous demon-fighting in stride and even become proud and respectful of her daughter's abilities. Her natural death from an illness in the fifth season forces Buffy to face becoming an adult.  Question: does buffy's mom know she's a slayer  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, it can be inferred that Buffy's mother, Joyce, is not aware of her daughter's supernatural abilities, specifically the fact that she is a Slayer. This is stated in the passage as follows:  ""Her mother is unaware of her daughter's powers and responsibilities until Buffy is forced to tell her at the end of the second season of the television series.""  This suggests that the revelation of Buffy's Slayer status occurs after a significant event, and the mother is not informed in a normal or casual way, implying that the news is not something she would have been privy to or expected to know."	126
1760466002	1760466003	Passage: Leaning Tower of Pisa -- The tower's tilt began during construction in the 12th century, caused by an inadequate foundation on ground too soft on one side to properly support the structure's weight. The tilt increased in the decades before the structure was completed in the 14th century. It gradually increased until the structure was stabilized (and the tilt partially corrected) by efforts in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.  Question: was the leaning tower of pisa built leaning  Explain your choice.	"I would choose the word ""lean"" instead of ""leaning"".  The reason is that ""leaning"" is a verb that can have different meanings depending on the context. In this case, ""leaning"" would mean the tower is tilting or sloping slightly to one side, which is the correct meaning in the context of the passage.  The word ""leaning"" is also the past participle of the verb ""lean"", which means to tilt or incline to one side. In this sentence, the word ""leaning"" is describing the state of the tower's tilt.  Using the verb ""lean"" instead of ""leaning"" would change the meaning of the sentence to ""The tower was leaning"". This would be a different interpretation, which might not be the intended meaning of the original sentence."	162
1760466003	1760466003	Passage: Fool's Gold (2008 film) -- Fool's Gold is a 2008 American adventure-romance film from Warner Bros. Pictures about a recently divorced couple who rekindle their romantic life while searching for a lost treasure. The film was directed by Andy Tennant and reunites the How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days stars Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson.  Question: is the movie fool's gold a true story  Explain your choice.	"The passage does not mention that the movie ""Fool's Gold"" is a true story. In fact, it's a work of fiction. The film's plot revolves around a romantic relationship between a recently divorced couple, and their search for a lost treasure, which is a fictional story."	59
1760466003	1760466004	Passage: Super Bowl curse -- The home field curse affects the host team of the Super Bowl. So far no team has yet managed to reach the Super Bowl in their home stadium. Four teams with Super Bowls in their home venue have qualified for the divisional playoffs: the 1994 Miami Dolphins, the 1998 Miami Dolphins, the 2016 Houston Texans, and the 2017 Minnesota Vikings, the Vikings being the first to qualify for their conference's title game. From 1966--2011 (excluding the six Super Bowl games held in a stadium without a professional team), the Super Bowl host team has had 11 winning seasons, four split seasons, and 25 losing seasons. Mathematically, the probability of that many losing seasons or more occurring by chance (assuming a 50 percent chance of having a losing season (disregarding .500 seasons)) is 7.69 percent. It should be noted, however, that the Super Bowl host stadium is selected several years before the game is played, without regard to the teams that qualify.  Question: has any nfl team played the superbowl at home  Explain your choice.	To answer this question, let's analyze the information given:  1. The home field curse - This is a myth that suggests that the home field can affect the outcome of the Super Bowl. 2. Four teams have qualified for the Super Bowl in their home stadium:      - Miami Dolphins (1994)     - Miami Dolphins (1998)     - Houston Texans (2016)     - Minnesota Vikings (2017) 3. The probability of a losing season or more occurring by chance is 7.69 percent, which translates to 0.0769 in decimal form. 4. Mathematically, the probability of any NFL team playing the Super Bowl at home is the probability of winning the division title and then playing in the Super Bowl, divided by the total number of possible outcomes.  Let's calculate the probability of a team playing the Super Bowl at home:  The probability of winning the division title is 1/16 (since there are 16 teams in the NFL). The probability of playing in the Super Bowl is 1/8 (since there are 8 teams that qualified for the Super Bowl).  The probability of playing in the Super Bowl at home is (1/16) × (1/8) = 1/128.  Now, let's calculate the probability of a team playing the Super Bowl at home:  (1/16) × (1/8) = 1/128 ≈ 0.0079  This is less than 0.0769, so the answer is no, none of the NFL teams have played the Super Bowl at home.	333
1760466004	1760466004	Passage: State constitution (Australia) -- In Australia, each state has its own constitution. Each state constitution preceded the Constitution of Australia as constitutions of the then separate British colonies, but all the states ceded powers to the Parliament of Australia as part of federation in 1901.  Question: does each australian state have its own constitution  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, I would choose that each Australian state has its own constitution. Here's why:  - The passage states that ""each state has its own constitution"" before mentioning that ""all the states ceded powers to the Parliament of Australia as part of federation in 1901"". This implies that the state constitutions existed before the federation, which occurred in 1901.   Additionally, the passage explicitly states that ""each state constitution preceded the Constitution of Australia"", which further supports the idea that the state constitutions predated the Constitution of Australia."	114
1760466004	1760466005	Passage: Bundle branch block -- A bundle branch block can be diagnosed when the duration of the QRS complex on the ECG exceeds 120 ms. A right bundle branch block typically causes prolongation of the last part of the QRS complex, and may shift the heart's electrical axis slightly to the right. The ECG will show a terminal R wave in lead V1 and a slurred S wave in lead I. Left bundle branch block widens the entire QRS, and in most cases shifts the heart's electrical axis to the left. The ECG will show a QS or rS complex in lead V1 and a monophasic R wave in lead I. Another normal finding with bundle branch block is appropriate T wave discordance. In other words, the T wave will be deflected opposite the terminal deflection of the QRS complex. Bundle branch block, especially left bundle branch block, can lead to cardiac dyssynchrony. The simultaneous occurrence of left and right bundle branch block leads to total AV block.  Question: can you have a right and left bundle branch block  Explain your choice.	I can explain this question.  The passage mentions that a right bundle branch block can cause a terminal R wave in lead V1 and a slurred S wave in lead I. However, it does not mention that a right bundle branch block can also cause a left bundle branch block.  In fact, the passage mentions that a left bundle branch block widens the entire QRS, and in most cases shifts the heart's electrical axis to the left. This suggests that a left bundle branch block is a type of bundle branch block, but it is a different type of bundle branch block than right bundle branch block.  A right bundle branch block, on the other hand, is a type of left bundle branch block, which widens the entire QRS and shifts the heart's electrical axis to the right.  Therefore, the correct answer is: no, a right bundle branch block cannot have a right bundle branch block.	186
1760466005	1760466005	Passage: Check (chess) -- In informal games, it is customary to announce ``check'' when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check. In formal competitions, however, check is rarely announced.  Question: do you always have to say check in chess  Explain your choice.	"In informal games, it's common for players to use the term ""check"" to indicate that they are putting their opponent's king in check. However, in formal chess competitions, this is not typically done.  My reasoning is that in formal competitions, the objective is to play the game in a more precise and structured manner, with a focus on strategy and accuracy. Announcing ""check"" in this context can be seen as unnecessary, as it may distract from the focus on the game and its strategic elements.  Additionally, in formal competitions, players are often expected to demonstrate their understanding of the game's rules and strategies, and announcing ""check"" may not be a necessary step in this process."	142
1760466005	1760466006	Passage: Australian Cattle Dog -- The Texas Heeler is a cross between the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Shepherd that was first registered with the Animal Research Foundation (ARF) in 1970. The ARF has registered Australian Cattle Dogs without papers as ``Australian Cattledog Queensland Heelers'' since 1965 and was the first organisation to recognise the Australian Shepherd. Although originally bred for its ability to work cattle, the Texas Heeler is increasingly used as a pet and a companion in dog sports. As with most cross breeds, the Texas Heeler's size and appearance is a variable combination of the parent breeds.  Question: is an australian shepherd the same as an australian cattle dog  Explain your choice.	No, an Australian Cattle Dog and an Australian Shepherd are not the same. Here's why:  1. Origin: The Australian Cattle Dog was bred for its ability to work cattle, while the Australian Shepherd is primarily bred for its intelligence, agility, and herding ability. 2. Purpose: The Australian Cattle Dog was originally bred to herd cattle, whereas the Australian Shepherd is often used for herding sheep, but also excels in other dog sports such as agility and obedience. 3. Size: Australian Cattle Dogs are generally smaller than Australian Shepherds, with a more compact build and a shorter stature. 4. Temperament: While both breeds are known for their intelligence and loyalty, Australian Cattle Dogs are often described as more independent and stubborn, whereas Australian Shepherds are often more outgoing and friendly. 5. Appearance: While both breeds have a medium-length coat, Australian Cattle Dogs have a more rugged, wiry coat, whereas Australian Shepherds have a longer, smoother coat.  Overall, the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Shepherd are distinct breeds with different purposes, temperaments, and physical characteristics.	237
1760466006	1760466007	Passage: Tomato purée -- Tomato purée is a thick liquid made by cooking and straining tomatoes. The difference between tomato paste, tomato purée, and tomato sauce is consistency; tomato puree has a thicker consistency and a deeper flavour than sauce.  Question: is tomato puree and tomato sauce the same thing  Explain your choice.	No, tomato purée and tomato sauce are not the same thing. The key differences between them are:  - **Consistency**: Tomato sauce is a thinner, more liquid consistency, while tomato puree is thicker and more solid. - **Flavor**: Tomato sauce has a milder, more acidic flavor due to the tomatoes being cooked down to release their natural sugars, which gives them a more intense flavor. Tomato puree has a more intense, concentrated flavor. - **Preparation method**: Tomato sauce is often made by simmering tomatoes with added salt, sugar, and sometimes herbs and spices, whereas tomato puree is made by cooking down tomatoes to extract their natural juices, resulting in a thicker, more concentrated paste.  In summary, while both tomato sauce and tomato puree are derived from tomatoes, they have distinct differences in terms of consistency, flavor, and preparation method.	179
1760466007	1760466007	Passage: The Blues Brothers -- The Blues Brothers are an American blues and soul revivalist band which was founded in 1978 by comedy actors Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi as part of a musical sketch on Saturday Night Live. Belushi and Aykroyd fronted the band, respectively in character as lead vocalist ``Joliet'' Jake Blues and harmonica player/vocalist Elwood Blues. The band was composed of well-known and respected musicians, and debuted as the musical guest on the April 22, 1978, episode of Saturday Night Live, opening the show performing ``Hey Bartender'', and later ``Soul Man''.  Question: is the blues brothers based on a true story  Explain your choice.	My choice is: No, the Blues Brothers are not based on a true story.  The passage does not mention any specific true events or people that inspired the creation of the band. It describes the formation and debut of the Blues Brothers as a fictional entity, created by Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi as part of a Saturday Night Live sketch. There is no indication that the band was inspired by real-life individuals or events.	89
1760466007	1760466008	Passage: Newcastle upon Tyne -- Newcastle upon Tyne (locally /njuːˈkæsəl/ ( listen)), commonly known as Newcastle, is a city in Tyne and Wear, North East England, 103 miles (166 km) south of Edinburgh and 277 miles (446 km) north of London on the northern bank of the River Tyne, 8.5 mi (13.7 km) from the North Sea. Newcastle is the most populous city in the North East, and forms the core of the Tyneside conurbation, the eighth most populous urban area in the United Kingdom. Newcastle is a member of the English Core Cities Group and is a member of the Eurocities network of European cities.  Question: is newcastle upon tyne the same as newcastle  Explain your choice.	"I would choose to explain that Newcastle upon Tyne is not the same as Newcastle upon Tyne.   The two are two different places with the same name, but with the difference in the second part of the name. ""Upon"" means ""on"" or ""upon the"" in this context. Therefore, Newcastle upon Tyne is the original name of the city, while Newcastle is the current name given to the city in some contexts, particularly in the UK and in some parts of Europe.  In this passage, the ""Newcastle upon Tyne"" is referring to the original name of the city, which is derived from the Old English ""Newcastrēne"" or ""Neustune"", meaning ""New Town"" or ""New settlement"". The ""upon"" part of the name is added to distinguish the city from other places with the same name, such as Newcastle upon Tyne, Newcastle, and Newcastle upon Tyne, which are all located in different locations."	198
1760466008	1760466009	Passage: Post Office Ltd -- The Post Office provides information on services and accepts postal items and payment on behalf of the two collection and delivery divisions of Royal Mail Group, Royal Mail and Parcelforce. These include a variety of ordinary and guaranteed services both for delivery within the United Kingdom and to international destinations. Postage stamps (including commemorative stamps and other philatelic items) are sold, while applications for redirection of mail are accepted on behalf of Royal Mail.  Question: is post office and royal mail the same  Explain your choice.	"No, post office and royal mail are not the same. Here's why:  - ""Post Office"" typically refers to the British postal service, which is a separate entity from Royal Mail. Post Office Ltd is a subsidiary of Royal Mail and is responsible for providing postal services in the UK, whereas Royal Mail is the national postal service in the UK.  - ""Royal Mail"" is a specific entity within the Post Office Ltd, referring to the Royal Mail Group's postal services. It is the primary postal service provider in the UK and includes Royal Mail, Parcelforce, and Royal Mail Parcel Service.  - ""Post Office Ltd"" specifically refers to the company itself, which is a separate entity from Royal Mail. It is a publicly listed company that provides postal services, including the Post Office, Royal Mail, and other services.  - ""Parcelforce"" is a subsidiary of Royal Mail, providing parcel delivery services, but it is not the same as the Post Office Ltd.  In summary, while Post Office Ltd and Royal Mail are related entities, they are distinct and separate organizations with different functions and responsibilities."	229
1760466009	1760466009	Passage: Unsuccessful nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States -- Justices are nominated by the president and then confirmed by the U.S. Senate. A nomination to the Court is considered to be official when the Senate receives a signed nomination letter from the president naming the nominee, which is then entered in the Senate's record. There have been 37 unsuccessful nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States. Of these, 11 nominees were rejected in Senate roll-call votes, 11 were withdrawn by the president, and 15 lapsed at the end of a session of Congress. Six of these unsuccessful nominees were subsequently nominated and confirmed to other seats on the Court. Additionally, although confirmed, seven nominees either declined office or (in one instance) died before assuming office.  Question: has any supreme court nominee not been confirmed  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, I would choose to exclude the 11 nominees who were rejected in Senate roll-call votes. This is because the passage specifically states that these nominees were ""nominated"" but did not mention that they were ""confirmed."" In other words, they were nominated by the president but not officially confirmed by the Senate."	67
1760466009	1760466009	Passage: Thanksgiving (United States) -- Thanksgiving, or Thanksgiving Day, is a public holiday celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States. It originated as a harvest festival. Thanksgiving has been celebrated nationally on and off since 1789, after Congress requested a proclamation by George Washington. It has been celebrated as a federal holiday every year since 1863, when, during the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a national day of ``Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens,'' to be celebrated on the last Thursday in November. Together with Christmas and the New Year, Thanksgiving is a part of the broader fall/winter holiday season in the U.S.  Question: is thanksgiving always the last thursday of the month  Explain your choice.	"I would choose to say that ""Thanksgiving is not always the last Thursday of the month."" Here's why:  *   Thanksgiving is celebrated on a specific date in November every year, but its exact date can vary. *   The month of November can start on different days, depending on whether it's a leap year or a non-leap year. *   There are 30 days in November, and the last Thursday in November can be as early as the 2nd or as late as the 30th, depending on the month.  Therefore, Thanksgiving can be celebrated on any Thursday between the 22nd and the 30th of November, not just on the last Thursday."	142
1760466009	1760466010	Passage: The Lord of the Rings -- The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J.R.R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.  Question: is lord of the rings after the hobbit  Explain your choice.	"I would say the correct completion of the sentence is ""The Lord of the Rings after The Hobbit"".   The reason for this is that ""after"" implies a sequence or progression, whereas ""The Lord of the Rings is"" is a prepositional phrase that indicates the subject of the sentence. ""After The Hobbit"" logically follows as the next event or action in the story, as it is the conclusion or outcome of The Hobbit."	91
1760466010	1760466010	Passage: Fallen (2016 film) -- In December 2014, it was announced that Torment, the second installment in the Fallen book series, was in development. It is unknown whether the last two novels, Passion and Rapture, and the spin-off novel, Unforgiven, will be adapted as well. In 2017, producer Kevan Van Thompson asked the fans if they want an adaptation of ``Torment'', showing that the sequel still could be made.  Question: is the fallen movie going to have a sequel  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, it appears that the answer is no, the Fallen movie is not going to have a sequel.  The passage mentions that the production company asked the fans if they want an adaptation of the sequel, but it does not indicate that the sequel is currently in development. It also mentions that the last two novels, Passion and Rapture, and the spin-off novel, Unforgiven, are not being adapted, suggesting that the plans for a sequel are not being pursued.  Additionally, the passage does not provide any information about the status of the movie or any plans for its release.	122
1760466010	1760466010	Passage: List of most-followed Instagram accounts -- This list contains the top 50 accounts with the most followers on the social photo-sharing platform Instagram. As of October 2018, the most followed user is Instagram's own account, with over 260 million followers. Cristiano Ronaldo is the most followed individual, with over 144 million followers. Twelve accounts have exceeded 100 million followers on the site.  Question: does anyone on instagram have 1 billion followers  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, the answer is no, none of the accounts mentioned have 1 billion followers. According to the passage, as of October 2018, the top 50 most-followed accounts on Instagram had a combined total of over 260 million followers, but none of them reached 1 billion followers.	65
1760466010	1760466010	Passage: Padmé Amidala -- George Lucas, Rick McCallum, and casting director Robin Gurland auditioned over 200 actresses for the part of Padmé Amidala. They chose 16-year-old actress Natalie Portman to play the role. According to The Phantom Menace production notes, ``The role required a young woman who could be believable as the ruler of that planet, but at the same time be vulnerable and open.'' Portman's performances in The Professional (1994) and Beautiful Girls (1996) impressed Lucas. He stated, ``I was looking for someone who was young, strong, along the lines of Leia. Natalie embodied all those traits and more.''  Question: in the phantom menace is padme the queen  Explain your choice.	"The passage states that Padmé Amidala is ""the Queen"" in The Phantom Menace."	20
1760466010	1760466011	Passage: The Lord of the Rings -- The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J.R.R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.  Question: is lord of the rings considered an epic  Explain your choice.	"I would say that ""The Lord of the Rings"" is not considered an epic in the classical sense, but rather a high fantasy novel. The term ""epic"" typically refers to a long, narrative poem or story that is considered to be of great importance, dignity, or grandeur. While ""The Lord of the Rings"" is indeed a long and influential work, it is more focused on character development, world-building, and action-adventure elements, rather than on grand, sweeping narrative themes or high-level storytelling.  In particular, ""The Lord of the Rings"" is often described as a ""high fantasy"" or ""high fantasy novel"" rather than an ""epic"" because it doesn't have the same level of scope, scale, or grandeur as some of the more famous epics, such as Homer's ""The Iliad"" or Virgil's ""The Aeneid"". Instead, it's more of a sprawling, detailed world-building exercise, with a focus on the internal struggles and conflicts of the characters, rather than a grand, climactic narrative arc.  That being said, ""The Lord of the Rings"" is still an incredibly influential and beloved work of fantasy literature, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest novels of the 20th century."	262
1760466011	1760466012	Passage: Euro sign -- The euro sign (€) is the currency sign used for the euro, the official currency of the Eurozone in the European Union (EU). The design was presented to the public by the European Commission on 12 December 1996. The international three-letter code (according to ISO standard ISO 4217) for the euro is EUR. In Unicode it is encoded at U+20AC € euro sign (HTML &#8364; &euro; ). In English, the sign precedes the value (for instance, €10, not 10 €, unlike most other European languages). In some style guides, but not others, the euro sign is unspaced.  Question: does the euro sign go before the number  Explain your choice.	The euro sign (€) goes before the value, not the number. According to the passage, the correct order is:  €10  In English, the sign precedes the value, whereas in most other European languages, the sign precedes the number (e.g., 10€).	61
1760466012	1760466012	Passage: Induction cooking -- For nearly all models of induction cooktops, a cooking vessel must be made of, or contain, a ferrous metal such as cast iron or some stainless steels. The iron in the pot concentrates the current to produce heat in the metal. If the metal is too thin, or does not provide enough resistance to current flow, heating will not be effective. Most induction tops will not heat copper or aluminum vessels because the magnetic field cannot produce a concentrated current; ``all metal'' induction tops use much higher frequencies to overcome that effect. Any vessel can be used if placed on a suitable metal disk which functions as a conventional hotplate.  Question: can stainless steel be used on induction cooktop  Explain your choice.	I can explain that stainless steel can be used on induction cooktops.  Although the passage states that most induction cooktops require a ferrous metal to function, it does not explicitly exclude stainless steel. However, stainless steel is a type of ferrous metal that can be used on induction cooktops.   Stainless steel is often a suitable choice because it provides a good balance of heat conduction and thermal conductivity, allowing for efficient heating. Additionally, stainless steel is generally a more durable and less reactive than other metals, which reduces the risk of corrosion and ensures a long lifespan for the cooktop.	123
1760466012	1760466013	Passage: Dismissal (employment) -- ``Firing'' is a common colloquial term in the English language (particularly used in the U.S.) for termination. The term ``firing'' may have been initiated in the 1910s at the National Cash Register Company. Other terms for dismissal are being ``sacked'', ``canned'', ``let go'', ``ran-off'', ``axed'', ``given walking papers'', ``given the pink slip'' or ``boned''. Other terms, more often used in Commonwealth countries, include ``to get the boot'' and ``to get the sack''.  Question: is job termination the same as being fired  Explain your choice.	"No, job termination and being fired are not exactly the same, although they are often used interchangeably in everyday language. While both terms describe the act of ending employment, the difference lies in their connotations and usage:  *   ""Firing"" is a more formal or official term, often used in written contexts, such as contracts or job applications. It implies a more permanent or permanent termination of employment, often with the intention of not being rehired. *   ""Termination"" is a more general term that can refer to the act of ending employment, regardless of the permanence or permanency of the outcome. It can be used in a more formal or informal context, depending on the situation.  In some cases, the term ""firing"" might be used to describe a more permanent termination, while in other cases, it might be used to describe a more temporary or temporary termination. In the context of the passage, it is likely that the author is using ""firing"" to refer to a more permanent termination, as the term is more formal and less commonly used in everyday language."	224
1760466013	1760466014	Passage: Inattentional blindness -- In a 2015 study, Cary Stothart, Walter Boot, and Daniel Simons attempted to replicate and extend the findings from both Graham and Burke's 2011 study and Steven Most and colleague's 2000 study on Amazon Mechanical Turk using a sample of 515 participants that varied in age. In this study, participants were tasked with counting the number of times a number of white moving objects crossed the vertical midpoint of a display while ignoring a number of black moving objects. The unexpected object in this case was a gray cross that moved horizontally across the display at various distances from the vertical midpoint (this was manipulated between participants). Overall, they found that inattentional blindness susceptibility increases with age, which replicates the finding from Graham and Burke. In fact, they found that every 10 years of age was associated with a 1.3 fold increase in the probability of displaying inattentional blindness. They also found that the probability of inattentional blindness increases as the distance between the observer's focus of attention and the unexpected object increases, which replicates the finding from Most and colleagues. However, they also found that the relationship that age has with inattentional blindness does not change as a function of the unexpected object's distance from the focus of attention, suggesting that useful field of view does not mediate the relationship between age and inattentional blindness.  Question: does age have any influence on attentional ability or inattentional blindness  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, the author's choice is that age does not have any significant influence on attentional ability or inattentional blindness.  The passage states that the researchers found an overall increase in inattentional blindness susceptibility with age, but also notes that the relationship between age and inattentional blindness does not change as a function of the unexpected object's distance from the focus of attention. This suggests that the increase in inattentional blindness susceptibility with age is not due to a change in the field of view, but rather due to some other factor, possibly cognitive or attentional abilities.  The passage also notes that the relationship between age and inattentional blindness increases as the distance between the observer's focus of attention and the unexpected object increases, but this does not suggest that age itself is the factor being investigated. Instead, it suggests that other factors, possibly related to cognitive or attentional abilities, are being investigated.  Overall, the passage implies that age is not a significant factor in the development or increase in inattentional blindness, but rather a factor that may influence the expression or manifestation of the condition.	226
1760466014	1760466014	Passage: Sanskrit -- Sanskrit belongs to the Indo-European family of languages. It is one of the three ancient documented languages that likely arose from a common root language now referred to as the Proto-Indo-European language:  Question: is sanskrit the first language of the world  Explain your choice.	"Based on the information provided, Sanskrit is not considered the ""first language of the world."" Instead, it is one of the three ancient documented languages that likely arose from a common root language known as Proto-Indo-European (PIE). PIE is the hypothetical ancestor of all Indo-European languages, including Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, and many others.  The statement ""one of the three ancient documented languages"" suggests that Sanskrit is one of several languages that were discovered to be part of the PIE family. The other two languages are Proto-Italic and Proto-Germanic, which are the ancestors of the Italic and Germanic languages, respectively.  Sanskrit is considered one of the most ancient surviving languages of the Indo-European family, with a documented history that spans over 3,000 years. It was used as a sacred language in ancient India, and it is still studied and used in various contexts today, including in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sanskrit studies.  In summary, while Sanskrit is an important and ancient language, it is not the ""first language of the world."" It is one of several languages that form part of the Indo-European family, and its significance lies in its historical and cultural importance rather than its status as the earliest known language."	260
1760466014	1760466015	Passage: Jack Russell Terrier -- The Jack Russell Terrier is a small terrier that has its origins in fox hunting. It is principally white-bodied and smooth, rough or broken-coated but can be any colour.  Question: is a jack russell considered a small breed  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, I would classify the Jack Russell Terrier as a small breed. Here's my reasoning:  1. The passage mentions that the Jack Russell is ""a small terrier"", which directly indicates that it is considered a small breed. 2. It also mentions that the breed can be ""principally white-bodied and smooth"", which further supports the idea that it is a small breed. 3. There is no mention of the breed having a large size, which suggests that it is not a large breed. 4. The passage also mentions that the breed can be ""any colour"", which implies that it is a general-purpose breed that can come in a range of colors, not just one specific color.  Overall, the passage presents a clear and concise definition of the breed, and the key characteristic of being small is explicitly mentioned."	176
1760466015	1760466016	Passage: Air Force One -- The Air Force usually does not have fighter aircraft escort the presidential aircraft over the United States but it has occurred, for example during the attack on the World Trade Center.  Question: does air force one travel with fighter escort  Explain your choice.	I would say that Air Force One typically does not travel with fighter escorts over the United States. While the Air Force may occasionally provide air cover or escort for high-level presidential aircraft, such as Air Force One, it is not a standard practice.  This is because Air Force One is a presidential aircraft that is specifically designed and equipped for the President's protection, and it is typically flown by the President and their designated flight crew. The Air Force would not need to provide a fighter escort for such a mission, as the primary purpose of Air Force One is to provide a secure and safe transportation for the President.  In contrast, the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001 was a separate incident where a commercial airliner, United Airlines Flight 93, was hijacked and crashed into the World Trade Center, and Air Force One was not involved in this incident.	176
1760466016	1760466017	Passage: AR-15s in California -- The Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989 banned Colt AR-15 rifles by name in the State of California. California's 2000 Assault Weapons ban went further and banned AR-15s made by other manufacturers by name such as Bushmaster, PWA, and Olympic Arms.  Question: is it legal to own an ar15 in california  Explain your choice.	"In California, the law regarding AR-15s is complex, and the answer to your question depends on the specific circumstances.  Prior to 2019, California's 2000 Assault Weapons Ban (AWB) prohibited the sale and possession of certain semi-automatic firearms, including AR-15s, by civilians. However, the law was amended in 2018 to expand the ban to include ""assault weapons"" that are capable of firing more than one round in rapid succession.  The 2019 amendment to the AWB prohibited the sale and possession of certain semi-automatic firearms, including AR-15s, by civilians, unless they were registered under the 1994 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. However, it did not specifically mention AR-15s by name.  In 2020, California voters passed Proposition 19, which banned the sale and possession of certain semi-automatic firearms, including AR-15s, with the following restrictions:  *   Semi-automatic rifles that can fire more than one round in rapid succession (e.g., AR-15s) are prohibited, unless registered under the 1994 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. *   Semi-automatic rifles that are capable of fully automatic firing are prohibited. *   Semi-automatic rifles that are capable of fully automatic firing, but do not fire more than one round in rapid succession, are allowed if they are registered under the 1994 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act.  So, is it legal to own an AR-15 in California?  The answer is yes, but with some caveats:  *   The 2019 amendment to the AWB prohibits the sale and possession of certain semi-automatic firearms, including AR-15s, unless they are registered under the 1994 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. *   The 2020 amendments to Proposition 19 allow for the sale and possession of certain semi-automatic firearms, including AR-15s, with certain restrictions. *   California law prohibits the sale and possession of semi-automatic rifles that can fire more than one round in rapid succession, unless they are registered under the 1994 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. *   California law also prohibits the sale and possession of semi-automatic rifles that are capable of fully automatic firing.  In summary, while it is generally legal to own an AR-15 in California, there are certain restrictions and requirements that apply. It's essential to familiarize yourself with California's laws and regulations regarding firearms before purchasing or possessing an AR-15 or any other semi-automatic firearm."	519
1760466017	1760466018	Passage: The Star-Spangled Banner -- ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' is the national anthem of the United States. The lyrics come from ``Defence of Fort M'Henry'', a poem written on September 14, 1814, by the then 35-year-old lawyer and amateur poet Francis Scott Key after witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry by British ships of the Royal Navy in Baltimore Harbor during the Battle of Baltimore in the War of 1812. Key was inspired by the large U.S. flag, with 15 stars and 15 stripes, known as the Star-Spangled Banner, flying triumphantly above the fort during the U.S. victory.  Question: is the national anthem and star spangled banner the same  Explain your choice.	"No, the national anthem and the Star-Spangled Banner are not the same.   The national anthem of the United States is actually ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" which is the lyrics of a poem written by Francis Scott Key in 1814, inspired by the bombardment of Fort McHenry by British ships in Baltimore Harbor during the War of 1812. The poem's title, ""Defence of Fort M'Henry,"" refers to the poem's author, Francis Scott Key, and the fort he witnessed.  The Star-Spangled Banner, on the other hand, is the official national anthem of the United States, which is a melody composed by John Stafford Smith in 1814, based on the poem. It is also known as ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" a reference to the American flag.  While both are named after the same event, they are distinct pieces of music and lyrics, and are used for different purposes."	195
1760466018	1760466018	Passage: Naples International Airport -- Naples International Airport (IATA: NAP, ICAO: LIRN) (Italian: Aeroporto Internazionale di Napoli) is the international airport serving Naples, Italy. It is located 3.2 NM (5.9 km; 3.7 mi) north-northeast of the city in the Capodichino district of Naples. The airport has two terminal buildings: Terminal 1 is for scheduled flights and Terminal 2, located away from the airfield, is used for charter operations.  Question: is there an international airport in naples italy  Explain your choice.	No, there is no international airport in Naples, Italy. The passage states that the airport serves Naples, Italy, and there is no mention of it being an international airport.	36
1760466018	1760466019	Passage: Cadbury Creme Egg -- Creme eggs are available annually between 1 January and Easter Day. In the UK in the 1980s, Cadbury made Creme Eggs available year-round but sales dropped and they returned to seasonal availability.  Question: can you buy cadburys creme eggs all year round  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, I would choose ""No"", the answer is ""No"". The passage states that Creme eggs are available between 1 January and Easter Day, which indicates a seasonal availability. This suggests that they are not available year-round.  Therefore, I chose ""No"" as the correct answer."	64
1760466019	1760466019	Passage: Homologous chromosome -- A couple of homologous chromosomes, or homologs, are a set of one maternal and one paternal chromosome that pair up with each other inside a cell during meiosis. Homologs have the same genes in the same loci where they provide points along each chromosome which enable a pair of chromosomes to align correctly with each other before separating during meiosis. This is the basis for Mendelian inheritance which characterizes inheritance patterns of genetic material from an organism to its offspring parent developmental cell at the given time and area.  Question: do homologous chromosomes carry information for the same traits  Explain your choice.	My answer is: Yes, homologous chromosomes carry information for the same traits.  Explanation: Homologous chromosomes are pairs of chromosomes that share the same genes in the same loci, where they provide points along each chromosome. This means that each homologous pair of chromosomes carries the same genetic information, including the same genes and their associated traits. This is a fundamental principle of Mendelian inheritance, which explains how the genetic information from an organism's parents is passed on to its offspring.	101
1760466019	1760466019	Passage: Michigan Wolverines football -- Michigan began competing in intercollegiate football in 1879. The Wolverines joined the Big Ten Conference at its inception in 1896, and other than a hiatus from 1907 to 1916, have been members since. Michigan has won or shared 42 league titles, and, since the inception of the AP Poll in 1936, has finished in the top 10 a total of 38 times. The Wolverines claim 11 national championships, most recently that of the 1997 squad voted atop the final AP Poll.  Question: has michigan ever won a national championship in football  Explain your choice.	I chose the year 1997 as the answer to the question about whether Michigan has won a national championship in football.   This is because, according to the passage, Michigan has won 11 national championships, and the most recent one was in 1997.	54
1760466019	1760466020	Passage: Waiter Rule -- The Waiter Rule refers to a common belief that one's true character can be gleaned from how one treats staff or service workers, such as a ``waiter''. The rule was one of William H Swanson's 33 Unwritten Rules of Management, copied from Dave Barry's version ``If someone is nice to you but rude to the waiter, they are not a nice person.''  Question: you can tell a lot about a person by how they treat their waiter  Explain your choice.	"This passage is not a real passage, and it appears to be a fabrication or a joke. However, if we were to analyze it, here's a possible interpretation:  The passage is likely using the Waiter Rule as a tongue-in-cheek example of how people's true nature can be inferred from their behavior towards others, in this case, a waiter. The passage suggests that if someone treats a waiter well, they are likely a kind and considerate person. Conversely, if someone treats a waiter poorly, they might be a rude and unfriendly individual.  This interpretation is not supported by any evidence or logical reasoning. The Waiter Rule is not a real rule and does not have any scientific basis or empirical evidence to support its claim. The phrase ""33 Unwritten Rules of Management"" is also not a real concept, and ""Dave Barry"" is a well-known American author, but not a professional in the field of management or hospitality.  In reality, people's behavior towards others, including their interactions with waiters, can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as personal characteristics, cultural background, and life experiences. While a person's behavior towards a waiter might provide some insight into their personality, it is not a reliable or foolproof indicator of their overall character or personality.  It's always best to approach social interactions with others with an open mind and without making assumptions based on someone's behavior towards a specific individual, whether it's a waiter or anyone else."	300
1760466020	1760466020	Passage: American crocodile -- Within the United States, the American crocodile's distribution is limited to the southern tip of Florida, though at least two have been found as far north as the Tampa Bay area. The current US population, estimated at 2,000, represents a significant recovery from a few hundred in the 1970s.  Question: are there any crocodiles native to north america  Explain your choice.	There are no native crocodiles in North America.   The passage mentions that the American crocodile is limited to the southern tip of Florida, which is a geographical and ecological characteristic of this species. There is no mention of any populations of American crocodiles in the north or any other part of North America.	64
1760466020	1760466021	Passage: Lex Luthor (Smallville) -- Season seven displayed Lex's descent into darkness; he has a brother-like relationship with Grant Gabriel (Michael Cassidy), the new editor of the Daily Planet newest editor, until it's revealed Grant is actually a clone of Lex's late brother. After Lex buys the Daily Planet, Grant attempts to keep Lex from being controlling, thus Lex has his brother's clone murdered and staged as a failed mugging. Lex then discovers that the previous symbols are connected to the secret organization Veritas, which his father is a part of. The Veritas members learned that an alien visitor known as ``The Traveler'' would arrive in Smallville during the meteor shower of 1989. At this time, Lex realizes that Lionel has been covering up the Traveler's existence and subsequently kills his own father for it. He eventually discovers that the Veritas members knew of a means to control the Traveler, so Lex sets out to find the device. The device, an orb he finds in the mantle above a fireplace in the Luthor mansion, leads Lex to the Fortress of Solitude, where he is confronted by Clark. Having finally discovered Clark's secret, Lex uses the orb to bring down the Fortress around Clark and himself.  Question: does lex luthor know who superman is in smallville  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, it appears that Lex Luthor does not know who Superman is in Smallville. The passage states that Lex discovers that the previous symbols on the Daily Planet are connected to the secret organization Veritas, and that one of the symbols is connected to the alien visitor ""The Traveler"". However, there is no mention of Lex ever knowing Superman's identity in the passage."	79
1760466021	1760466021	Passage: Admission to the bar in the United States -- In the canonical case, lawyers seeking admission must earn a Juris Doctor degree from a law school approved by the jurisdiction, and then pass a bar exam administered by it. Typically, there is also a character and fitness evaluation, which includes a background check. However, there are exceptions to each of these requirements. A lawyer who is admitted in one state is not automatically allowed to practice in any other. Some states have reciprocal agreements that allow attorneys from other states to practice without sitting for another full bar exam; such agreements differ significantly among the states.  Question: do you have to have a college degree to take the bar exam  Explain your choice.	No, you do not have to have a college degree to take the bar exam in the United States. The typical requirement is a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from a law school approved by the jurisdiction where you want to practice.  The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that a bachelor's degree is not a requirement for taking the bar exam, as long as the individual has completed the required Juris Doctor degree program and has met the state's bar admission requirements.	97
1760466021	1760466022	Passage: Iron Fist (season 2) -- The second season of the American web television series Iron Fist, which is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, follows Danny Rand / Iron Fist, a martial arts expert with the ability to call upon the power of the Iron Fist. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films and other television series of the franchise. The season is produced by Marvel Television in association with ABC Studios, with Raven Metzner serving as showrunner.  Question: will there be a season 2 of marvel's iron fist  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, I would say that there will likely not be a season 2 of Marvel's Iron Fist.  The passage mentions that the season is ""set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)"" and shares continuity with the films and other television series of the franchise. This suggests that the show is part of the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, which implies that there will be future seasons, not a standalone series like season 2.  Additionally, the passage does not provide any information about the fate of the show, such as whether it has been canceled, put on hiatus, or whether there are plans for more seasons. Therefore, it is likely that season 2 will not be produced or will not be part of the franchise.  It's worth noting that Marvel Studios has announced that they are working on a new Iron Man series, Iron Man and The Eternals, which is expected to be a standalone series. However, this is a separate project from Iron Fist, and there is no indication that Iron Fist will be revived or continue in some form."	218
1760466022	1760466023	Passage: Toll-free telephone numbers in the North American Numbering Plan -- In the United States of America, Canada, and other countries participating in the North American Numbering Plan, a toll-free telephone number has one of the area codes 800, 833, 844, 855, 866, 877, and 888.  Question: is 844 a toll free number in canada  Explain your choice.	Based on the North American Numbering Plan, 844 is not a toll-free number in Canada.  The reason for this is that 844 is actually a toll number, not a toll-free number. In the North American Numbering Plan, toll numbers are typically denoted by a prefix of 1 followed by a 3-digit area code, like 1-800-123-4567. Numbers with a 1 followed by 3 digits, like 844, are toll numbers, not toll-free numbers.  In Canada, where the North American Numbering Plan is widely used, the standard toll numbers are:  * 1-800 numbers (800, 877, 866, 855, 844, 833, 811) * 1-800 numbers with 3 digits (e.g., 1-800-CALL-MADE)  On the other hand, toll-free numbers are denoted by a prefix of 1 followed by a 3-digit area code, like 1-800-GOT-JUNK? or 1-800-FIX-IT.  So, 844 is not a toll-free number in Canada, but rather a toll number.	246
1760466023	1760466023	Passage: Daylight saving time by country -- Most areas in North America and Europe, and some areas in the Middle East, observe daylight saving time (DST), while most areas of Africa and Asia do not. In South America, most countries in the north of the continent near the equator do not observe DST, while Paraguay and southern parts of Brazil do. The practice of observing daylight saving time in Oceania is also mixed, with New Zealand and parts of southeastern Australia observing DST, while most other areas do not.  Question: does any other country have daylight savings time  Explain your choice.	No, other countries do not observe daylight saving time.   Countries that observe daylight saving time (DST) include most areas in North America and Europe, and some areas in the Middle East. However, this is not the case for most areas of Africa and Asia.	54
1760466023	1760466023	Passage: Johnny Vander Meer -- John Samuel Vander Meer (November 2, 1914 -- October 6, 1997) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a pitcher, most notably for the Cincinnati Reds. Vander Meer is best known for being the only pitcher in Major League Baseball history to throw two consecutive no-hitters. After the impressive start to his major league career, he experienced problems controlling the accuracy of his pitching, and his later career was marked by inconsistent performances.  Question: has anyone ever pitched back to back no hitters  Explain your choice.	"I have chosen to answer the question ""has anyone ever pitched back to back no hitters"" as ""no"".   The passage mentions that Vander Meer was the only pitcher in Major League Baseball history to throw two consecutive no-hitters, but it does not specifically state that he pitched back-to-back no-hitters."	63
1760466023	1760466023	Passage: Black Bike Week -- Black Bike Week, also called Atlantic Beach Bikefest and Black Bikers Week, is an annual motorcycle rally in the Myrtle Beach, South Carolina area, held on Memorial Day weekend. It is also sometimes called Black Fill-in-the-Blank Week, because it has evolved to attract many non-motorcycling visitors who come for music, socializing and enjoying the beach. Events include motorcycle racing, concerts, parties, and street festivals. Called a ``one-of-a-kind event'' and ``an exhibitionist's paradise'' by Jeffrey Gettleman, Black Bike Week is ``all about riding, styling and profiling,'' in the words of Mayor Irene Armstrong of Atlantic Beach, South Carolina.  Question: is there a black bike week in myrtle beach  Explain your choice.	"I chose the correct completion of the passage as ""Myrtle Beach""."	15
1760466023	1760466024	Passage: Static (DC Comics) -- It was recently revealed that prior to his abduction, Static teamed with Justice League member Black Lightning in order to stop former Blood Syndicate member Holocaust, who had tried to kill the superhero while he was acting as the keynote speaker at Ernest Hemingway High's senior graduation.  Question: are static shock and black lightning the same person  Explain your choice.	After analyzing the passage, I would argue that Static and Black Lightning are not the same person. Here's why:  1. **Physical Appearance**: Static is a superhero with a unique, energetic and electrifying appearance, with the ability to generate electricity from his body. Black Lightning, on the other hand, is a superhero with the ability to control and manipulate electricity, but he does not have the ability to generate electricity from his body like Static.  2. **Origin**: Static's powers are derived from a radioactive spider bite, which he received when he was a child. Black Lightning's powers, on the other hand, are a result of exposure to a strange, otherworldly energy emanating from a meteorite that crashed in the African jungle. This energy imbues him with incredible powers, but it's not related to Static's radioactive bite.  3. **Personality and Abilities**: Static is a more serious and brooding character, often struggling with his troubled past. Black Lightning, on the other hand, is a more confident and charismatic hero, often using his charm and wit to defuse tense situations.  4. **Costume and Equipment**: Static's costume is a distinctive blue and silver suit with a lightning bolt emblem, while Black Lightning's costume is a black and gold suit with a lightning bolt emblem.  5. **Background and Character History**: Static's origin story is deeply connected to his childhood trauma and his struggles with the Blood Syndicate, while Black Lightning's origin story is more focused on his family history and his connection to the meteorite.  In summary, while both characters have the ability to control electricity, they are distinct individuals with different backgrounds, personalities, and styles, making it clear that they are not the same person.	362
1760466024	1760466025	Passage: Unbreakable glass -- Unbreakable glass is glass, or glass substitute, which does not display the normal fragility of glass - in general the term is not used to refer to something that is absolutely unbreakable.  Question: is there such a thing as unbreakable glass  Explain your choice.	"Based on general knowledge, I would say that there is no such thing as ""unbreakable glass."" The term ""unbreakable"" is a marketing term often used to describe products or materials that are exceptionally strong and resistant to breakage, but not necessarily indestructible. Glass, on the other hand, is a naturally occurring material that can break or shatter under certain conditions, such as impact or thermal stress.  However, the term ""unbreakable"" can be applied to some types of glass substitutes, such as:  1. Glass-ceramic: This type of glass is made from a mixture of glass and ceramic materials, which gives it a harder and more durable surface than regular glass. 2. Ceramic glass: Some ceramic glasses are designed to be more durable and resistant to breakage than traditional glass. 3. Polycarbonate: This type of plastic material is often used in window panes and other applications where strength and impact resistance are critical.  In these cases, the term ""unbreakable"" is used to emphasize the material's exceptional strength and durability. However, it's essential to note that even these materials can still be broken or damaged under extreme circumstances, such as extreme forces or extreme temperatures.  In general, the term ""unbreakable"" implies a certain level of durability that is not entirely guaranteed, whereas ""unbreakable"" is more of a marketing term used to convey exceptional strength and resistance to breakage."	299
1760466025	1760466026	Passage: Liquid latex -- As the latex dries it becomes very sticky and will stick to itself if accidentally folded over. Most manufacturers offer a slick spray for latex once it is dry to take away the stickiness allowing the movement of the model's limbs. Alternatively, shimmer powders can be dusted over dried liquid latex to create metallic effects. One advantage to the tackiness of liquid latex is that it can act as an adhesive to attach things to the paint, such as zippers.  Question: can liquid latex be used as an adhesive  Explain your choice.	Liquid latex can be used as an adhesive, but with some caveats.  The passage mentions that liquid latex becomes sticky and stick to itself if accidentally folded over, which is a characteristic of adhesive properties. However, in the context of using liquid latex, the sticky property is a benefit rather than a drawback.  The passage also mentions that liquid latex can act as an adhesive when dusted with shimmer powders, which is an alternative use of liquid latex. This suggests that the adhesive properties of liquid latex can be leveraged in specific situations, such as attaching small details or materials to the model.  Therefore, my choice is that liquid latex can be used as an adhesive, but it requires careful handling and application to avoid the sticky property.	150
1760466026	1760466026	Passage: Gun laws in Texas -- Gov. Perry also signed H.B. 1815 after passage by the 2007 Legislature, a bill that allows any Texas resident to carry a handgun in the resident's motor vehicle without a CHL or other permit. The bill revised Chapter 46, Section 2 of the Penal Code to state that it is in fact not ``Unlawful Carry of a Weapon'', as defined by the statute, for a person to carry a handgun while in a motor vehicle they own or control, or to carry while heading directly from the person's home to that car. However, lawful carry while in a vehicle requires these four critical qualifiers: (1) the weapon must not be in plain sight (in Texas law, ``plain sight'' and ``concealed'' are mutually exclusive opposing terms); (2) the carrier cannot be involved in criminal activities, other than Class C traffic misdemeanors; (3) the carrier cannot be prohibited by state or federal law from possessing a firearm; and (4) the carrier cannot be a member of a criminal gang.  Question: is it illegal to carry a pistol in your car in texas  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, it is not entirely clear whether it is illegal to carry a pistol in your car in Texas. However, the passage states that carrying a handgun in a car requires the following conditions:  1. The weapon must not be in plain sight. 2. The carrier cannot be involved in criminal activities, other than Class C traffic misdemeanors. 3. The carrier cannot be prohibited by state or federal law from possessing a firearm. 4. The carrier cannot be a member of a criminal gang.  While these conditions seem to prohibit carrying a handgun in a car, the passage does not explicitly state that carrying a handgun in a car is illegal. The conditions seem to be restrictions on who can carry a handgun in a car, rather than a blanket prohibition on carrying a handgun in a car.  Therefore, it is not illegal to carry a pistol in your car in Texas, but rather, you must meet the specified conditions to do so.	196
1760466026	1760466027	Passage: Sgian-dubh -- When worn as part of the national dress of Scotland, the sgian-dubh is legal in Scotland, England and Wales. In Scotland under the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 Sec. 49, Sub-sec. 5(c); in England and Wales, under the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (section 139) and the Offensive Weapons Act 1996 (section 4).  Question: is it legal to carry a sgian dubh  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, it appears that carrying a sgian dubh (a type of Scottish dagger) is generally legal in Scotland, England, and Wales, but there are specific exceptions and restrictions.  In Scotland, carrying a sgian dubh is allowed under certain circumstances, as stated in the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 (Sec. 49, Sub-sec. 5(c)). However, this law specifically mentions that carrying a sgian dubh is only allowed for the purpose of ceremonial or historical purposes, such as in Scottish Highland games or other events.  In England and Wales, the situation is slightly different. The Offensive Weapons Act 1996 (section 4) prohibits carrying certain types of knives and bladed articles, including swords, within a 6-foot radius of a public place. While the sgian dubh is not explicitly mentioned in this act, it is likely that it falls under the category of a bladed article, which is prohibited.  Therefore, based on the information provided, it is likely that carrying a sgian dubh is not legal in England and Wales, and may be considered an offense under the Offensive Weapons Act 1996 (section 4).	252
1760466027	1760466028	Passage: Hypoglossal nerve -- The hypoglossal nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve, and innervates all the extrinsic and intrinsic muscles of the tongue, except for the palatoglossus which is innervated by the vagus nerve. It is a nerve with a solely motor function. The nerve arises from the hypoglossal nucleus in the brain stem as a number of small rootlets, passes through the hypoglossal canal and down through the neck, and eventually passes up again over the tongue muscles it supplies into the tongue. There are two hypoglossal nerves in the body: one on the left, and one on the right.  Question: several cranial nerves innervate structures of the tongue  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, several cranial nerves innervate structures of the tongue:  1. The hypoglossal nerve 2. Vagus nerve 3. Palatoglossus (except for the hypoglossal nerve)  The vagus nerve is the only cranial nerve that is not mentioned as innervating the tongue, which is innervated by the hypoglossal nerve.	87
1760466028	1760466028	Passage: Puerto Rico -- Puerto Rico (Spanish for ``Rich Port''), officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (Spanish: Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, lit. ``Free Associated State of Puerto Rico'') and briefly called Porto Rico, is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea.  Question: is porto rico a part of the united states  Explain your choice.	"Based on the information provided, I would say that Puerto Rico is not part of the United States. Here's why:  * ""Puerto Rico"" is mentioned as the Spanish name for the territory, which indicates that it is a distinct entity with its own language, culture, and identity. * The official name ""Commonwealth of Puerto Rico"" further emphasizes that it is a self-governing territory, not a state, which is a unique characteristic of the United States. * The fact that it is an ""unincorporated territory"" suggests that it does not have the same level of autonomy as states, which is a key characteristic of the United States.  Therefore, based on these factors, I would conclude that Puerto Rico is not a part of the United States."	158
1760466028	1760466028	Passage: Sales taxes in the United States -- Washington has a 6.50% statewide sales tax. Local rates vary based on an individual's location at the point of purchase and can total up to 3.10% for a combined rate of 9.60%. In addition, due to the large number of Native American sovereign nations located within the state, sales-tax rates, if any, can vary based on state treaties with each nation.  Question: is there sales tax in the state of washington  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, the answer is yes, there is a sales tax in the state of Washington.  The passage explicitly states that Washington has a 6.50% statewide sales tax, and mentions that local rates can range from 3.10% to 9.60%. This implies that the state has a uniform sales tax rate of 6.50%, and local rates can be applied to varying degrees.	86
