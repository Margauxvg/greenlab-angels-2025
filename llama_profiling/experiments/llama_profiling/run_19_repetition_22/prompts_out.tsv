1760473978	1760473978	Premise: It was a complex language. Not written down but handed down. One might say it was peeled down.  Hypothesis: the language was peeled down  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise ""It was a complex language. Not written down but handed down. One might say it was peeled down"" can be interpreted as a metaphorical expression meaning that the language was obscure or unintelligible, but the action of peeling it down implies a process of revealing or exposing the underlying simplicity or essence of the language.  Given this interpretation, the hypothesis that the language was peeled down seems to be supported. The phrase ""peeled down"" is an idiomatic expression that suggests a process of stripping away layers, which aligns with the idea of exposing the underlying simplicity of the language.  My choice is affirmative because the premise provides a clear and coherent image of a language that was complex and difficult to understand, and the hypothesis takes this complexity and translates it into a concrete, observable process of revealing the language's essence."	169
1760473978	1760473979	Premise: It is part of their religion, a religion I do not scoff at as it holds many elements which match our own even though it lacks the truth of ours. At one of their great festivals they have the ritual of driving out the devils from their bodies. First the drummers come on - I may say that no women are allowed to take part in this ritual and the ladies here will perhaps agree with me that they are fortunate in that omission.  Hypothesis: no women are allowed to take part in this ritual  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise seems to hint that the women's participation is restricted, but it doesn't explicitly state that no women are allowed to participate. The phrase ""the ladies here will perhaps agree with me"" suggests that the women might not be opposed to the ritual, but rather, they might be skeptical or opposed to the restriction.  Therefore, my answer to whether the premise entails the hypothesis is ""no,"" because the premise implies that the women might not be opposed to the restriction, not that no women are allowed to participate."	105
1760473979	1760473979	Premise: The Paris to Rouen railway was being extended to Le Havre, and the line cut straight through Dr Flaubert's land. Part of it was to be compulsorily purchased. You could say that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy.  Hypothesis: Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise states that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy, and the hypothesis suggests that this is the cause of his creative retreat.   However, this is a circular and incomplete hypothesis. The premise implies that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat by epilepsy, but the hypothesis is not stated to explain why he was shepherded there in the first place. This creates a logical fallacy.  A more plausible hypothesis would be that the premise is intended to suggest that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy because of the complications caused by the railway extension project, and that this is the cause of his creative retreat. This would provide a clear explanation for the event and make the hypothesis more plausible.	155
1760473979	1760473980	Premise: Part of it was to be compulsorily purchased. You could say that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy. You could also say he was driven there by the railway.  Hypothesis: Gustave was driven to creative retreat in Croisset by the railway  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise sets up a situation where Gustave was driven to the creative retreat by the railway. To test this hypothesis, we need to examine if the railway was indeed the driving force behind Gustave's decision to be taken to the retreat.  My choice to consider this premise is that it sets up a clear cause-and-effect relationship between the railway and Gustave's actions. The railway is presented as a catalyst or a trigger that leads to Gustave's decision to be taken to the retreat, which is a specific outcome.  The use of the word ""driven"" also implies a sense of coercion or compulsion, which is a key aspect of the hypothesis. This suggests that Gustave was indeed forced or persuaded to attend the retreat, rather than choosing to go voluntarily.  Furthermore, the fact that the railway is described as ""compulsory"" suggests that the decision to attend the retreat was not a voluntary one, which supports the hypothesis.  Therefore, based on the premise, the hypothesis is supported."	205
1760473980	1760473981	Premise: Some of them, like for instance the farm in Connecticut, are quite small. If I like a place I buy it. I guess you could say it's a hobby.  Hypothesis: buying places is a hobby  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""Some of them, like for instance the farm in Connecticut, are quite small. If I like a place I buy it. I guess you could say it's a hobby"" can be seen as a statement that attempts to make a connection between the act of buying a place and the idea of it being a hobby.  However, upon closer examination, the hypothesis that buying places is a hobby is not entirely supported by this premise.  The premise suggests that buying a place is not necessarily a hobby, as it implies that someone is only buying the place if they like it. This implies that buying a place is not a deliberate act of pleasure or enjoyment, but rather a practical decision based on factors like location, convenience, or financial considerations.  The phrase ""I guess you could say it's a hobby"" is a colloquial expression that is used to soften the statement, but it doesn't necessarily convey a clear understanding of what a hobby is. Hobbies are typically activities that bring enjoyment and fulfillment, such as playing a musical instrument, painting, or gardening.  Therefore, while the premise does attempt to make a connection between buying a place and the idea of it being a hobby, it is not a strong enough connection to support the hypothesis that buying places is a hobby."	261
1760473981	1760473981	Premise: Look, my dear, I'm not in my dotage yet, and I know I'm a grumbler and a complainer. You could say the only form of comfort I 've got are my complaints.  Hypothesis: the only form of comfort he has are his complaints  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise states that your dear is a grumbler and a complainer, which suggests that he has a tendency to complain about various things.   The hypothesis states that the only form of comfort he has are his complaints, implying that the only thing that brings him comfort is complaining.   My choice is to say that the premise does entail the hypothesis. Here's why:  - The premise mentions that he is a ""grumbler and a complainer"", which directly aligns with the hypothesis.   - The word ""complaints"" is used to describe his nature, reinforcing the idea that complaining is a significant part of his identity."	131
1760473981	1760473982	Premise: Then the silence in the Zoo became complete. Woil stared around him and then suddenly with a push of his wings raised himself into the air, turned, and landed ten feet away on the back of a green bench. Creggan could see that he was afraid and that his fear was making him terribly uncertain.  Hypothesis: Woil was afraid  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise sets the scene and establishes the context, which is that Woil has just appeared out of nowhere and landed on a bench in the zoo. However, it does not necessarily entail the hypothesis that Woil is afraid.  The premise is more of a setup for the story, introducing the character and setting. It does not establish Woil's personality, motivations, or emotions, which are crucial for making a judgment about whether he is afraid.  To make a conclusion about whether Woil is afraid, we would need more information about his emotional state, such as how he reacted when he landed on the bench, or how he perceives the situation. The premise does not provide sufficient context to draw a conclusion about Woil's fear.	150
1760473982	1760473982	Premise: But, of course, that just wasn't possible. Her disappointment over Jonathan, which had driven her to France in the first place, had been relegated somewhere to the back of her mind. Now in retrospect she could see that marriage to him would have been a ghastly mistake and that her reaction to discovering that he had been seeing other women while he had been engaged to her had had far more to do with wounded pride than with a wounded heart.  Hypothesis: marriage to Jonathan would have been a ghastly mistake  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise is a reflection on the protagonist's past, where she realizes that she was wrong to judge Jonathan based on his infidelity. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a statement about the nature of the protagonist's experience (marriage to Jonathan). The premise is an introspective and self-critical statement, while the hypothesis is a factual statement that can be tested or proved through evidence.  In other words, the premise is more of a personal insight or realization, while the hypothesis is a statement about the actual situation. The two are not directly related, and the premise does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis.	139
1760473982	1760473983	Premise: Like now. The Community in Knockglen would defend Eve vociferously. Even some of the Sisters here in Dublin might see that the girl had a point.  Hypothesis: the girl had a point  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Based on the premise, it seems that the girl in Knockglen is defending Eve, and some of the Sisters in Dublin might also be considering the girl's point.   The hypothesis, ""the girl had a point,"" suggests that the girl in Knockglen is defending Eve, which is supported by the premise. The fact that some of the Sisters in Dublin might see the girl's point implies that they too are considering the girl's argument.  My choice is ""Yes"" because the premise seems to be setting up a situation where the girl in Knockglen is defending Eve, and some of the Sisters in Dublin might be considering the girl's point. This creates a plausible scenario where the hypothesis could be true."	146
1760473983	1760473983	Premise: ``They have to be crushed, Bobkins!'' So saying, she marched off down the gravel path, making the kind of crunching noise Robert had thought could only be produced by the BBC sound-effects department. As they rounded the edge of the building he could see that behind the house was a vast garden.  Hypothesis: behind the house was a vast garden  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise states that ""They have to be crushed, Bobkins!"" which implies that something is being crushed or damaged. The phrase ""crushed"" is a strong verb that suggests a physical act of breaking or destroying something.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states ""behind the house was a vast garden"". This sentence describes a feature of the house, but it doesn't imply that anything is being crushed or damaged. It simply states a fact about the house.  Therefore, the premise and hypothesis do not entail each other. The premise is a statement of action, while the hypothesis is a statement of observation or fact. The two statements are unrelated, and the hypothesis is not supported by the premise."	145
1760473983	1760473984	Premise: ``Do you mind if I use your phone?'' Ronni could see that Guido's brain was whirring.  Hypothesis: Guido's brain was whirring  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise ""Do you mind if I use your phone?"" does not entail the hypothesis ""Guido's brain was whirring"".  The premise is a simple question, asking permission for someone to use someone else's phone, which is a common and everyday situation. However, the hypothesis is a specific and unusual consequence of that action, suggesting that Guido's brain is whirring.  The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is that the premise is a specific situation (asking permission to use someone's phone), and the hypothesis is an unusual outcome (Guido's brain whirring) that arises from that situation.   A more fitting hypothesis might be ""I've been using your phone"" or ""You're going to be upset if I use your phone"", which are more specific and relevant consequences of the premise."	169
1760473984	1760473984	Premise: ``Look, lady, give me a break. I just deliver the stuff, I don't interview it for the Sunday papers.'' He waved the paper at her and even at a distance she could see that it said very little.  Hypothesis: the paper said very little  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise and hypothesis seem to be contradictory. The premise states that the paper said very little, while the hypothesis suggests that the paper actually contains a lot of information.   If the premise is true, then the hypothesis is false, and vice versa. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. In other words, the premise does not provide any information that would lead to the conclusion that the paper said very little.	85
1760473984	1760473984	Premise: ``You 've heard something like that before. Haven't you, Jimmy?'' Jimmy had been shaken by those sounds more shaken than the others for good reason but Cardiff could see that he was unprepared to show it as he pushed himself away from the reception counter.  Hypothesis: Jimmy was unprepared to show he had been shaken  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise is stating that Jimmy was shaken by the sounds, but it does not directly relate to his emotional state or his preparedness to show it. The hypothesis, ""Jimmy was unprepared to show he had been shaken,"" is inferred by the premise, but it is not stated directly."	70
1760473984	1760473985	Premise: It was Alan's idea. He made a sour kind of joke out of it, that they must wait until their wedding night. Carolyn agreed because she could see he meant it although she didn't understand why.  Hypothesis: Alan meant it  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	This premise and hypothesis seem to be a play on words, where the premise states that Alan made a joke about waiting until their wedding night, and the hypothesis is that he meant it literally.  However, upon closer examination, the premise and hypothesis don't actually entail each other. The premise is a setup for a joke, and the hypothesis is a response to the joke. The joke is not meant to be taken literally, but rather to be humorous.  The premise is more of a setup for a humorous or ironic situation, and the hypothesis is a response to that setup. Therefore, the premise and hypothesis do not entail each other, and the premise does not support the hypothesis.	138
1760473985	1760473986	Premise: And why bother to write anyway? What was there to say? Mary had some vague idea that Adam's parents might suspect he was down here and come to see him.  Hypothesis: Adam was down here  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""Mary had some vague idea that Adam's parents might suspect he was down here"" is a crucial part of the hypothesis ""Adam was down here"". The premise sets the stage for the subsequent events and provides a context for the story to unfold.  To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, I would argue that it does. Here's why:  * The premise implies that there is some information or suspicion about Adam's whereabouts, which is a key aspect of the hypothesis. The fact that Mary is thinking about this suggests that she has some knowledge or insight into Adam's situation, which is what the hypothesis is trying to explain. * The premise is a specific statement about Mary's thoughts, which is a type of observation or inference that can be used to test the hypothesis. The fact that she is thinking about Adam's parents suggests that she is actively trying to figure out why they might suspect him, which is a common pattern of thinking in situations like this. * The premise is not just a random statement, but rather it is a part of a larger narrative that is trying to build up to a specific point, which is the hypothesis. The fact that it is presented as a vague idea that Mary has, rather than a concrete statement, makes it a more plausible starting point for the hypothesis.  Overall, the premise provides a clear connection between the hypothesis and the story, and it sets the stage for the events that will unfold as the story progresses."	295
1760473986	1760473986	Premise: ``And you're not having this dress,'' Nora said, bending down to look at the price tag. ``It's two and a half guineas!'' she hissed at Louise who could tell that she was genuinely appalled.  Hypothesis: Nora was genuinely appalled  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Nora said ""And you're not having this dress,"" which implies that Nora is questioning Louise's decision to wear the dress, not that she herself is appalled by the dress.  The hypothesis states that Nora is genuinely appalled, which is not supported by the premise. The premise only expresses Nora's reaction to Louise's decision, not her own feelings or thoughts."	90
1760473986	1760473987	Premise: She said good morning to Alice and Alice said hallo. She was thin and rather tall with a very lined gentle face and hair that was white but which Alice could see had once been blonde. She could also have told this was Tina's mother before Mrs Darne went off down the passage that led to the Headmaster's Flat.  Hypothesis: this was Tina's mother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise entails the hypothesis. Here's why:  1. The description of the subject's physical appearance (thin, tall, and with a ""very lined"" face) and hair that was once blonde, but is now white, matches Tina's physical appearance in the story. This suggests a high degree of similarity between the subject and Tina. 2. The mention of Tina's mother being mentioned in passing as ""Mrs. Darne"" also implies that the subject is Tina's mother, as it is likely that the subject is Mrs. Darne, Tina's mother.  The only potential ambiguity in the premise is the reference to ""the Headmaster's Flat"", which is not explicitly stated to be Tina's home. However, it is implied that the subject is Tina's mother, given the context of the story."	168
1760473987	1760473987	Premise: She might have sat all afternoon, nibbling and stuporous, exhausted but not sleepy. But the glazier finally came down from the upper floor, cheerfully announcing that all was now right and tight and he would be on his way. Maggie could tell that he would have liked to stop for a chat that he felt sorry for her left on her own but she lacked either her grandmother's grace or her mother's energy so she did not offer him tea.  Hypothesis: the glazier would have liked to stop for a chat  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise entails the hypothesis in several ways:  1. The glazier is cheerful and wants to stop for a chat, which suggests that he might have had a pleasant experience with the house or its occupant. This implies that the glazier is someone who values social interaction and conversation. 2. The glazier's tone and demeanor indicate that he is not simply going about his business, but is instead taking the time to stop and chat with the occupant. This suggests that he is engaged and interested in talking to the person. 3. The fact that the glazier is ""cheerfully"" announcing that all is now right and tight implies that he is relieved to have completed his work and is looking forward to continuing with his day.  However, it's worth noting that the hypothesis is not explicitly stated, and the premise only tells us that the glazier stopped to chat, without explaining why he did so. The hypothesis would require additional information to be made explicit, such as the glazier's intentions or the occupant's reaction to the glazier's visit."	227
1760473987	1760473988	Premise: Jim waited. He waited a long time, and when the young doctor finally came out, it was almost dark. Jim could nonetheless tell by his anxious face that something was wrong.  Hypothesis: something was wrong  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""Jim waited a long time, and when the young doctor finally came out"" implies that something is wrong, but the word ""something"" is ambiguous and somewhat vague. While it could be interpreted in different ways, the most likely and logical interpretation is that ""something"" refers to the doctor's appearance or behavior, rather than the underlying reason for his visit.  In this case, Jim's anxiety suggests that the doctor's appearance or behavior is abnormal or concerning, rather than the medical issue itself. This is because the doctor's sudden appearance, even after a long wait, implies that something is amiss."	125
1760473988	1760473988	Premise: ``Yes?'' ``Nathan?'' He could tell it was long-distance the line was so gravelly and hollow but he didn't recognise the voice.  Hypothesis: the call was long-distance  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise states that the line is ""gravelly and hollow"", which implies that the voice is weak and distant. However, the hypothesis is that the call is ""long-distance"", which suggests that the voice is strong and clear.   If the premise is true (the line is gravelly and hollow), it would not support the hypothesis (the call is long-distance) because the two statements describe opposite characteristics."	94
1760473988	1760473989	Premise: Chopra stood unsteadily on his feet. The shapechanger bounded around with excitement. Chopra could tell something had happened.  Hypothesis: something had happened  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""Chopra stood unsteadily on his feet"" and ""The shapechanger bounded around with excitement"" creates an interesting and intriguing situation.  The premise sets a scene of chaos and unpredictability, with Chopra being unsteady on his feet and a shapechanger (which can be a creature from a sci-fi or fantasy setting) bounding around excitedly. This creates a sense of tension and foreboding, suggesting that something has happened that has caused a significant disturbance or disruption.  The hypothesis ""something had happened"" implies that there is a cause or explanation for the chaos. This creates a clear direction for the story to follow, and raises questions such as what this event is, why it happened, and what its consequences will be.  My choice to say that the premise entails the hypothesis is correct because the premise provides a clear and coherent setup for a narrative, which is a key element of a story. The events described create a clear direction for the story to unfold, and the hypothesis provides a clear explanation for the chaos that has occurred.  However, it's worth noting that the premise is quite vague and doesn't provide a lot of context or details about what has happened or why. This lack of information creates a sense of mystery, which can be a powerful tool in storytelling. It also leaves room for the reader to fill in the gaps and create their own theories about what has happened."	286
1760473989	1760473990	Premise: It seemed impossible that anyone could endure such pain for so long, but at last the doors of the Renault slammed and there was comparative silence. The engine was started up, revving violently as the car was turned round on the narrow road. John could tell that it was being driven back up the hill towards Putna.  Hypothesis: the car was being driven back up the hill towards Putna  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise and hypothesis are not related. The premise states that the doors of the Renault slammed and there was comparative silence, while the hypothesis is that the car was being driven back up the hill towards Putna.   The premise provides a situation, but the hypothesis is a prediction or a statement about the direction of the car, not a description of the situation. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.	83
1760473990	1760473990	Premise: Just when you think you 've got it straight, along comes the Fool with his pig's bladder and whops you on the nose. By the way, I'm no idiot. I could tell Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see me at the airport.  Hypothesis: Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see her at the airport  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""Just when you think you 've got it straight, along comes the Fool with his pig's bladder and whops you on the nose"" is a play on words that sets up a potential joke or humorous situation.   However, the hypothesis ""Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see her at the airport"" seems to contradict the premise. The premise suggests that the speaker thinks they have ""got it straight,"" implying that they know what's going on. The wordplay ""pig's bladder"" is a clever and unexpected twist on the phrase ""got it straight,"" which would naturally lead the reader to assume that the speaker has been duped or deceived.   In contrast, the hypothesis seems to be stating a fact or observation, which doesn't align with the premise. The correct interpretation of the premise should be that the speaker thinks they've ""got it straight"" but is actually being misled or deceived by Gillian and Stuart.   Therefore, the hypothesis doesn't entail the premise."	202
1760473990	1760473991	Premise: He's weird enough to have undressed me without thinking, according to some mad notion of the ``proper'' thing to do. Perhaps he thought I couldn't lie in bed with my clothes on.  Hypothesis: she couldn't lie in bed with her clothes on  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	This premise and hypothesis are related but not identical.  The premise states that someone has undressed the speaker without thinking, implying a lack of restraint or control. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the speaker cannot lie in bed with their clothes on.  The two statements are related because if the speaker cannot lie in bed with their clothes on, it implies that they would normally be able to lie in bed without their clothes on, which is the premise. However, the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. The premise only states that the person undressed the speaker, without specifying that the speaker is capable of lying in bed without their clothes on. Therefore, the premise does not provide sufficient information to support the hypothesis.	148
1760473991	1760473991	Premise: That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort. Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all. But you will perhaps understand that there was a natural tendency on my part in asking what was after all a generous favour from my employer to hint that there was a good professional motive behind my request.  Hypothesis: there was a natural tendency on her part to hint that there was a good professional motive behind her request  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise sets the context for a conversation between two characters, Mr. Farraday and Miss Kenton, in a particular situation where the tone of the conversation is lighthearted and humorous. The premise does not provide any information about Miss Kenton's intentions or motivations, so it does not necessarily imply that she would have hinted at a good professional motive.  In fact, the premise suggests the opposite: that Miss Kenton's request was a ""generous favour"" from Mr. Farraday, implying that she is a kind and helpful person. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a conclusion that is not supported by the premise. A more likely hypothesis would be that Mr. Farraday's request was genuine and not a ""generous favour"" from Miss Kenton."	168
1760473991	1760473992	Premise: But don't dilly-dally for too long. Once it's published we are all going to look a little risible if we have made no adjustments to what is after all known as being predominantly my own design of gallery. Also I am a bit older than the rest of you but you can perhaps understand that I don't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation.  Hypothesis: he doesn't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""I am a bit older than the rest of you but you can perhaps understand that I don't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation"" is the hypothesis because it is the opposite of the expected conclusion.  In the context of the story, the premise suggests that the protagonist is actually older and has a wealth of knowledge that they're trying to hide. The phrase ""drop dead without a proper and public recantation"" implies that the protagonist is actually going to reveal this secret, which contradicts the premise.  If the premise is true, then the hypothesis would be ""I am not older than the rest of you"" because it's actually the opposite of the expected conclusion."	145
1760473992	1760473992	Premise: I should dearly have liked to know whether they were Europeans or Americans, but I couldn't hear the accents. They appeared to be arguing. I hoped the white men weren't telling him to eliminate all witnesses because I don't believe it would have needed much persuasion.  Hypothesis: eliminating all witnesses would have needed much persuasion  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	This premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise describes a situation where the speaker is trying to infer the identity of the people involved based on their accents, but it doesn't provide any information about their accents or their relationship with each other. The fact that they appear to be arguing doesn't necessarily imply that they are Europeans or Americans.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that eliminating all witnesses would have needed much persuasion, which is a conclusion that is drawn from the premise but not necessarily supported by it. The premise only provides a context for the hypothesis, but it doesn't provide enough information to support the conclusion.	128
1760473992	1760473993	Premise: But the damage was done as far as my faith was concerned, which is probably why I went mad. So anyway, that Christmas Eve night confirmed my worst fears, it was like a kind of ``royal flush'' for the infant Jimbo. All three kings - Pa Santa and the King of Kings - all down the pan together... And to be honest I don't believe any of them stands a chance of ever making a comeback with me.  Hypothesis: any of the three kings stands a chance of ever making a comeback with him  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise presents a dark and ominous tone, hinting at a catastrophic event or a significant disruption. Here's why I think it entails the hypothesis:  1. **The reference to ""the infant Jimbo""**: The mention of a ""royal flush"" and ""three kings"" creates a vivid and intense image, suggesting a dramatic and potentially catastrophic event. The use of the word ""infant"" also implies a sense of vulnerability and innocence, which contrasts with the ominous tone. 2. **The comparison to a ""royal flush""**: The phrase ""like a royal flush"" is often associated with a sudden, unexpected, and potentially disastrous event. It implies that the kings' attempt to reunite is a last-ditch effort to salvage something that's already lost. 3. **The king's fate**: The statement ""All three kings - Pa Santa and the King of Kings - all down the pan together"" suggests that the king is in a precarious position, possibly even in a state of collapse or defeat. This implies that the king's efforts to reunite are futile, and the outcome is dire. 4. **The speaker's self-deprecation**: The speaker's statement ""So anyway, that Christmas Eve night confirmed my worst fears"" reinforces the idea that the event is a turning point, a moment of realization that the king's efforts have failed, and the speaker's faith in him is shaken.  Considering these points, I believe the premise does entail the hypothesis. The premise sets up a scenario where the king's attempt to reunite is a catastrophic event, and the speaker's faith is shaken, suggesting that the hypothesis that any of the kings could make a comeback with the speaker is plausible."	350
1760473993	1760473994	Premise: He had seen something I should have, which was a car turning in from Soho Square and coming up behind me. My right foot hovered over the accelerator pedal and I balanced Armstrong on the clutch. I wasn't as convinced as Malpass that Nevil was out of harm's way.  Hypothesis: Nevil was out of harm's way  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""He had seen something I should have, which was a car turning in from Soho Square and coming up behind me"" is a narrative device that creates tension and suspense, drawing the reader into the story. It creates a sense of foreboding and raises questions about the situation.  However, the hypothesis ""Nevil was out of harm's way"" is a logical conclusion based on the premise. The premise establishes that Nevil is the primary suspect in a crime, and that something is being seen by the narrator that suggests he is in danger. This creates a clear motivation for the narrator to believe that Nevil is out of harm's way.  Given the premise, the hypothesis is not necessarily true. The narrator's hesitation and uncertainty about Nevil's safety create a sense of tension and uncertainty, which is a common narrative device used to build suspense. The hypothesis is not a logical conclusion, but rather an interpretation of the situation.  A better hypothesis might be ""Nevil is hiding something"" or ""Nevil is not who he seems to be."" This hypothesis is more plausible and raises more questions than it answers, creating a sense of intrigue and uncertainty in the reader."	241
1760473994	1760473995	Premise: Jed wondered. He 'd scarcely set eyes on him since the night they 'd had dinner together at the house in Westwood. Nobody had mentioned him either and Jed didn't feel he should ask.  Hypothesis: Jed should ask  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""Jed wondered. He 'd scarcely set eyes on him since the night they 'd had dinner together at the house in Westwood"" implies that Jed has a strong desire or curiosity about someone, likely a romantic interest, and has not spoken to them in a long time.  The hypothesis ""Does the premise entail the hypothesis?"" suggests that the premise is a statement that directly relates to the hypothesis. In other words, the premise provides a condition or situation that is necessary for the hypothesis to be true.  However, the premise does not directly address the hypothesis, and the relationship between the two is not explicitly stated. Jed's curiosity and desire to know about the person who was at the dinner party are the focus of the premise, but the hypothesis is not explicitly connected to the situation.  Therefore, the premise does not directly entail the hypothesis, as the hypothesis is not stated or implied in the given information."	188
1760473995	1760473996	Premise: Yet what good came from knowing that a woman had killed herself? The children who had suffered a trauma would survive the experience, scarred by it and a little flawed by it. They would never forget that for a week they had imagined the act of murder had been committed.  Hypothesis: for a week the children had imagined the act of murder had been committed  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise entails the hypothesis. Here's why:  1. The premise starts by describing the traumatic event that occurred, which is the death of a woman. 2. It then suggests that the children who witnessed the event had a profound and lasting impact on them, describing them as ""scarred by it and a little flawed by it"". 3. The premise then shifts to a week after the event, where the children imagine that the act of murder had been committed. 4. The hypothesis, in this case, is ""for a week the children had imagined the act of murder had been committed"", which directly follows from the premise.  In other words, the premise sets the stage for the hypothesis, describing the immediate and immediate consequences of the traumatic event, and then builds upon that scenario by having the children imagine the act of murder had been committed. This creates a logical and coherent sequence of events that supports the hypothesis."	190
1760473996	1760473996	Premise: Nora calculated that there must be lots of single men up there so she decided it was ideal for the ``manhunt'', as we called it, even though the train fare was a serious consideration. I remember we went up to Euston together one Saturday morning, very excited, to buy the ticket in advance. It was a secret - if my parents had known she was going away alone they would have soon put the kybosh on it.  Hypothesis: Nora was going away alone  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise (""Nora calculated that there must be lots of single men up there so she decided it was ideal for the 'manhunt', as we called it"") is the statement that Nora's decision to go alone to Euston Station is related to the number of single men in the area.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, is ""Nora was going away alone"".  To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.  The premise is saying that Nora's decision to go alone to Euston Station was based on the number of single men in the area. This implies that the number of single men would influence her decision.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, simply states that Nora was going away alone, without specifying the reason. This is a separate statement that does not necessarily follow from the premise.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise provides a reason for Nora's decision, but it is not a necessary condition for the hypothesis to be true.  In other words, the number of single men in the area does not guarantee that Nora was going away alone, and Nora's decision to go alone was not solely based on the number of single men."	255
1760473996	1760473997	Premise: His mother driving the car, so happy, young-looking and fashionably dressed and his father, a big, confident man in a smart suit, smiling and turning round to say something to Simon in the back seat. Marie thought of her own mother with her frumpy clothes and ageing, lined face. No one would have guessed that she was only forty-two.  Hypothesis: Marie's mother was only forty-two  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise presents a scenario that suggests Marie's mother is only 42 years old, given her youthful appearance and style. This premise sets up a contrast between her appearance and her age, which could be seen as a clever setup for a story or a character development.  However, the hypothesis ""Marie's mother was only 42"" is not directly supported by the premise. The premise mentions that Marie's mother is ""frumpy"" and "" ageing"", which could imply that she is old, not young. It's unlikely that a 42-year-old woman would be described as ""frumpy"" or "" ageing"". This could suggest that the premise is not setting up the hypothesis, but rather the other way around - that Marie's mother is actually an older woman, which is not what the premise suggests.   A better hypothesis might be something like ""Marie's mother is an older woman"" or ""Marie's mother is 42 years old"". This would be more supported by the premise."	203
1760473997	1760473998	Premise: ``I hope you are settling down and the cat is well.'' This was a lie. She did not hope the cat was well.  Hypothesis: the cat was well  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""I hope you are settling down and the cat is well"" is a statement that is generally true because it is a common expression used to wish someone well and convey a positive sentiment. The expectation behind the phrase is that the person is indicating they are in a stable and settled situation, which would typically include having a cat.  However, the hypothesis that the cat was well is based on a false premise. The premise does not specify what the speaker is referring to as ""the cat."" It's possible that the speaker was referring to themselves or another person, but it's not clear. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The statement does not provide enough information to determine the truth value of the hypothesis."	147
1760473998	1760473998	Premise: Jane ate without pausing. Hunger was an unknown experience. She had never imagined it could actually hurt.  Hypothesis: hunger could actually hurt  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"I would say that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states that ""Hunger was an unknown experience"" which implies that Jane had no prior knowledge or expectation about hunger. This suggests that she had not imagined or anticipated hunger before.  On the other hand, the hypothesis states that ""hunger could actually hurt"". This implies that Jane has already experienced hunger before and has come to understand its effects.  Given that the premise states that hunger was unknown to Jane, it is unlikely that she would have anticipated that it could hurt. In fact, she may have been unaware of the physical and emotional discomfort that hunger can cause. Therefore, the premise does not provide a sufficient basis for the hypothesis."	148
1760473998	1760473999	Premise: Miss Martindale had had a school, but her rigid ideas and stern manner had frightened the children, and their parents had taken them away. And gradually the school declined, until she had to give it up and retire to end her days in the white cottage with the inevitable cat as her only companion. Breeze had never imagined that digging was such hard work.  Hypothesis: digging was such hard work  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that Miss Martindale's rigid ideas and stern manner had frightened the children, and they had taken her away from the school. This implies that the rigid and stern nature of Miss Martindale's behavior is a contributing factor to the decline of the school.  The premise also states that the school had to be given up, which is a direct consequence of the rigid and stern nature of Miss Martindale's behavior. The fact that she had to give up the school suggests that the rigid nature of her behavior was a significant factor in the school's decline.  The final sentence, ""Breeze had never imagined that digging was such hard work,"" is also a consequence of the premise, as it suggests that Breeze, who is the only one left to take care of the school after the others have left, has been doing the hard work of maintaining the school.  Therefore, the premise sets the stage for the hypothesis that digging is indeed hard work, as it establishes that Miss Martindale's rigid and stern nature is a contributing factor to the decline of the school, and that someone else, Breeze, is the one doing the hard work."	246
1760473999	1760474000	Premise: ``You don't need to worry. We're quite adequately chaperoned. Rosa is a woman of strict moral principles.'' If she knows I'm in here she's probably hovering outside the door right now.  Hypothesis: he's in here  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise provides information about Rosa's character, stating that she is ""a woman of strict moral principles."" However, this information does not provide any direct information about her whereabouts or location within the room. The premise does not specify whether she is inside or outside, or what she is doing.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that ""he's in here."" This statement is a conclusion that can be drawn from the premise, but it is not a direct inference from the information provided. The premise does not provide any information about the person's location, so it is not possible to conclude that he is in the room based on the given information."	142
1760474000	1760474000	Premise: I said you were mad to come over at this time. It's a world event. Don't you know that Venice is packed with visitors?  Hypothesis: Venice is packed with visitors  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This is a classic example of a syllogism.  The premise ""Venice is packed with visitors"" is true, but the conclusion ""It's a world event"" is not necessarily true. The premise only tells us that Venice is crowded, but it doesn't provide any information about its significance or importance on a global scale.  To make a syllogism, the conclusion should logically follow from the premise. In this case, the premise is true, but the conclusion is not. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  A possible correction to the premise could be ""Venice is a significant cultural and historical landmark, attracting millions of tourists worldwide."" In this revised premise, the conclusion is logically derived from the premise, making the hypothesis more plausible."	158
1760474000	1760474001	Premise: And what she had said, and went on saying quietly, calmly, efficiently, was that she loved Maggie. She paid attention. At eight Maggie had not known that her grandmother was famous but she had seen that people had something in their manner when they looked at Rachel.  Hypothesis: Maggie's grandmother was famous  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise describes a situation where Maggie sees a woman named Rachel, and Maggie's grandmother is described as being famous. However, the premise does not state that the grandmother is famous, it simply states that Maggie has heard something about her grandmother. The fact that people have a certain manner when they look at Rachel is a separate piece of information that does not directly relate to the hypothesis.  The hypothesis is ""Maggie's grandmother was famous"", which is a conclusion that can be inferred from the premise. However, the premise does not provide enough information to support this conclusion."	127
1760474001	1760474001	Premise: They 'd seen Miss Lavant on the promenade and about the town, always walking slowly, sometimes with a neat wicker basket. Kate had often thought she was beautiful. She hadn't known she was in love with Dr Greenslade who had a wife already and three children.  Hypothesis: Miss Lavant was in love with Dr Greenslade  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise introduces the following elements that contradict the hypothesis:  1. Miss Lavant is described as being ""beautiful"", which contradicts the hypothesis that she is not beautiful. 2. The premise states that Kate has ""often thought she was beautiful"", which implies that Miss Lavant has a high opinion of herself, contradicting the hypothesis that she is not beautiful. 3. The premise also states that Miss Lavant is described as ""walking slowly"" and ""with a neat wicker basket"", which could be seen as a physical characteristic that is not necessarily a reflection of her beauty, contradicting the hypothesis that she is beautiful.  Therefore, the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that Miss Lavant is in love with Dr Greenslade."	168
1760474001	1760474002	Premise: Did he intend everyone in the castle to know he did not want the wife he had married in such a hurry? Did he intend to ignore her completely? Then Isabel saw Ellen's stunned face and realised that her maid at least did not know she had spent the night alone.  Hypothesis: Isabel had spent the night alone  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that Isabel spent the night alone, and it is implied that she did not intend to ignore her wife or the wife's maid. The fact that the maid does not know that Isabel spent the night alone suggests that Isabel did not intend to ignore her or her wife, but rather, she chose to keep the secret.  In this scenario, the premise provides sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that Isabel did spend the night alone, as it states that she spent the night alone and the maid does not know.	114
1760474002	1760474002	Premise: Most of them young, about his age, stood and talked and drank and laughed. The two girls he had noticed earlier were standing talking to some other girls. Graham hoped they all realised that just because he was standing talking to Slater that didn't mean he was gay too.  Hypothesis: Graham was gay too  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	This premise entails the hypothesis because it assumes that the speaker, Graham, is gay, and then presents evidence (the girls he notices are talking to someone else) that would lead the reader to infer that he is gay too.   In other words, the premise states that Graham is a young man who is likely gay, and then provides a specific instance of him being with someone else, implying that he might be gay. The inference is that this supports the hypothesis that Graham is gay.  This type of reasoning is known as a syllogism, where a general premise is used to arrive at a specific conclusion based on a particular instance.	130
1760474002	1760474002	Premise: He said that maybe I wasn't ready to join the Party just yet. Terry's passion for equality appealed to my purer mind, and his hatred of existing authority appealed to my resentments. But although I hated inequality it didn't mean I wanted to be treated like everyone else.  Hypothesis: he wanted to be treated like everyone else  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise suggests that Terry's attitude towards equality and authority is complex and nuanced, which implies that he is not necessarily anti-authoritarian or anti-equality in the classical sense. The phrase ""treated like everyone else"" suggests a desire for equality, but not necessarily a desire to be treated like everyone else. In other words, Terry is not necessarily looking to eliminate authority or individuality, but rather to reduce the differences between himself and others.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, assumes that Terry's desire to be treated like everyone else is the underlying motivation for his actions. However, the premise suggests that this desire is not the primary driver, but rather a result of his complex attitudes towards equality and authority."	154
1760474002	1760474003	Premise: ``Oh, my poor Folly... We 've been together for five years, Lexy and I - she practically holds that company together. Of course I gave her an ``A''. But that doesn't mean I'm having an affair with her.  Hypothesis: he is having an affair with Lexy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise sets up a situation where Lexy seems to be the central figure in the relationship, but the tone and language used suggest otherwise. The phrase ""she practically holds that company together"" implies a close, intimate relationship between Lexy and the speaker, which raises suspicions about the speaker's intentions.   Given the context, the speaker's statement ""Of course I gave her an 'A'"" could be seen as a veiled admission of infidelity, implying that the speaker's actions (giving Lexy an ""A"") may be a sign of an affair. The phrase ""I'm having an affair with Lexy"" directly contradicts the premise, which sets up a contrast between what is expected to be the speaker's relationship with Lexy and what is actually happening.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise suggests a situation where the speaker is not having an affair with Lexy, but rather, it appears that Lexy is the one who is being intimate and close to the speaker, which is not consistent with the speaker's statement."	216
1760474003	1760474004	Premise: Nevertheless, her heart sank at the thought of spending an evening with him in his present state of mind, and she was tempted to invent a sore throat in order to get out of it. But he had been very helpful over the Puddephat business, she admitted to herself, and his moods were unpredictable - he might be on top of the world by the time he arrived at the cinema. ``I'm still keen if you are '' she said brightly pretending she had not noticed anything was amiss.  Hypothesis: something was amiss  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states that the protagonist is tempted to invent a sore throat in order to get out of spending an evening with her partner, implying that she is experiencing some kind of discomfort or stress related to their relationship. The idea of inventing a problem, such as a sore throat, is a common tactic people use to avoid social interactions or uncomfortable situations.  The hypothesis, ""something was amiss,"" suggests that the protagonist is trying to convey that there is a problem or issue with their relationship. The fact that she is pretending not to notice anything is a red flag that the protagonist is trying to hide or downplay the issue, which implies that she is trying to avoid discussing the problem or confronting it.  The author uses this premise to set up the plot, where the protagonist's partner's unpredictable moods and the suggestion that he might be on top of the world at the cinema create a sense of tension and foreboding, hinting that something is amiss in their relationship."	208
1760474004	1760474005	Premise: What must it be like to be imprisoned here, day after day, month after month? I wonder, does he keep them chained and manacled, thought Fenella, or does he use sorcery? And so utterly immersed was she in this strange blue and green land that was not feeling strange any more that she did not even notice that she was weighing sorcery against steel chains and seriously considering the likely outcome.  Hypothesis: Fenella was weighing sorcery against steel chains  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise of the story suggests that Fenella is being held in a strange, isolated location with no apparent means of escape, and she is both fascinated and terrified by the situation. The use of the word ""immersed"" implies that Fenella is deeply invested in the mystery of her confinement, suggesting that she is not just passively accepting her situation, but actively seeking answers and trying to make sense of it.  The comparison of sorcery against steel chains implies a sense of contrast between the natural, organic world of the blue and green land and the rigid, industrial prison system. This contrast creates a sense of tension and unease, implying that Fenella is grappling with the idea that she is trapped in a world that is both beautiful and oppressive.  The fact that Fenella is weighing sorcery against steel chains suggests that she is considering the possibility of escape, and is using her imagination to think about the consequences of her situation. This is a rational and proactive approach, which is in line with the character's intellectual curiosity and desire for autonomy.  Overall, the premise and the hypothesis seem to be a plausible and engaging combination, suggesting that Fenella is a resourceful and intelligent character who is determined to find a way out of her confinement."	252
1760474005	1760474006	Premise: Strasbourg, Vienna, Bucharest, Istanbul, not stopping, not looking back. I saw her tossing newly gauffred curls as the open roadster headed east, away from Ollie... Temporarily I managed to re-erect my jocular facade, but inside I was panicking. He could take her away I thought he could just do that he has such power to hurt me this little furry creature who hasn't even noticed that I 've given up the weed.  Hypothesis: he has given up the weed  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise and hypothesis appear to be closely related, but there are some key differences in the wording and context.  The premise sets the scene for a romantic relationship between an individual (Ollie) and a woman (the ""little furry creature""). The woman is described as ""newly gauffred"" (a colloquialism for ""recently married"" or ""recently divorced""), which implies a romantic relationship. The fact that the woman has ""given up the weed"" suggests that she has ended a previous relationship or has chosen to leave her past behind.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the narrator has ""given up the weed"" in the sense that they have given up their romantic feelings for the woman. This implies that the narrator is trying to move on from the relationship.  However, the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. The word ""giving up"" can be interpreted in different ways, and it's not explicitly stated that the narrator has given up their romantic feelings. It's possible that the narrator is simply trying to move on from the relationship, but not necessarily emotionally.  To make the premise and hypothesis more closely related, the hypothesis could be rephrased as: ""I have given up my romantic feelings for Ollie"" or ""I have given up my emotional attachment to Ollie."" This would make it clear that the narrator is trying to move on from the relationship."	293
1760474006	1760474007	Premise: It - the tractor, the boys and the bulbs in the earth - knew she had chosen for them and was coming back to them. Of course there was still love, there was healthy, growing love and its name was called Work. She had fallen in love with it so slowly and gently and sweetly that she had never noticed it had happened.  Hypothesis: falling in love had happened  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""It - the tractor, the boys and the bulbs in the earth - knew she had chosen for them and was coming back to them"" is an unusual and poetic way of describing the concept of falling in love. The premise doesn't directly relate to the hypothesis ""falling in love had happened"".  However, upon closer examination, it can be interpreted that the premise is hinting at a hypothetical or hypothetical scenario where the speaker is describing a romantic relationship between the earth and someone, possibly a person or an entity. The phrase ""knew she had chosen for them"" implies that the speaker believes this person has chosen them, and the ""coming back"" suggests a romantic or intimate relationship.  In this sense, the premise can be seen as a form of poetic or metaphorical exploration of the idea of falling in love, rather than a literal statement about the nature of love. The hypothesis ""falling in love had happened"" is more of a statement about the concept of falling in love itself, rather than a specific event or experience.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the premise is more of a thought experiment or a poetic interpretation rather than a direct explanation of a specific event."	246
1760474007	1760474007	Premise: After the twelfth dot, two thirds of the way down the page, the transcript of this long session tails away into blank paper. I suppose what's happened is this. He has gone on staring out of the window thinking and she has gone on staring at him waiting with such absorption that neither of them noticed the tape had run out.  Hypothesis: the tape had run out  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise and hypothesis appear to be related but distinct concepts.  The premise describes a situation where the transcript of a long session has run out, and two characters are staring out of the window and inside the room, respectively. The implication is that they are both lost in thought.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the tape has run out, which implies a change in the physical state of the transcript. The hypothesis suggests that this change is the cause of the characters' distraction, rather than their staring.  Given this distinction, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise is describing a situation where the transcript has run out, but it does not imply that the physical state of the transcript has changed. The characters' distraction is a separate issue that may be caused by the fact that the transcript has run out, but it is not directly related to the tape.  Therefore, the premise provides a separate explanation for the characters' distraction, while the hypothesis is a separate cause for the situation.	205
1760474007	1760474008	Premise: ``His name is Matthew Blake,'' Mandy informed Charity as they descended the steps from their cabin on to the paved pathway that led to the lodge. Thankfully she hadn't even noticed that Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt and was now wearing red shorts with her white silk blouse.  Hypothesis: Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""His name is Matthew Blake,"" and Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt and is now wearing red shorts with her white silk blouse"" does not entail the hypothesis.  The hypothesis is ""Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt."" The premise only mentions Charity's name and her physical appearance, without stating the change in her clothing. The hypothesis, on the other hand, specifically states the action that happened after the premise."	92
1760474008	1760474008	Premise: ``These ` ere smugglers is a dangerous bunch from wot I 've ` eard!'' ``If only we could devise a safe way of laying our hands on all that money,'' murmured Pugwash, whose greed was as proverbial as his cowardice. And the pirates were so busy discussing the problem and what they would do with the reward if they won it that they didn't notice that they were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage.  Hypothesis: the pirates were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise is saying that the pirates are being observed from the window above by the new Mayor and his entourage.   However, the hypothesis is ""the pirates were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage"".   This creates a logical contradiction because the premise states that the Mayor and his entourage were being observed by the pirates, but the hypothesis states that the pirates were being observed by the Mayor and his entourage."	105
1760474008	1760474009	Premise: Ockleton, Morpurgo, Cornelius, Dysart and half a dozen others too drunk to mention. But there was so much coming and going that any one of us could have slipped out, pushed Everett through the window and slipped back again without being noticed. Damn it all we didn't even notice Everett was missing until a porter tripped over him in the quad so anything's theoretically possible.  Hypothesis: Everett was missing  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""Ockleton, Morpurgo, Cornelius, Dysart and half a dozen others too drunk to mention, but there was so much coming and going that any one of us could have slipped out, pushed Everett through the window and slipped back again without being noticed. Damn it all we didn't even notice Everett was missing until a porter tripped over him in the quad so anything's theoretically possible"" is a humorous, yet suspiciously plausible scenario.  Here's why the premise entails the hypothesis:  1. **Multiple individuals**: The premise mentions a large group of people (at least 7, with ""half a dozen"" being an excessive number for a casual gathering). This suggests that a large group of people were present, which increases the likelihood of Everett being able to slip out unnoticed. 2. **Multiple exits**: The premise mentions multiple exits (the window and the quad), which implies that there are multiple ways for someone to exit the building or location. 3. **Unnoticeable disappearance**: The fact that Everett was not noticed until a porter tripped over him suggests that Everett was able to move around undetected for a significant amount of time, which is a plausible scenario given the large group size and multiple exits. 4. **The porter's action**: The porter tripping over Everett in the quad implies that Everett was in a position to be easily pushed or slipped away, which is consistent with the premise.  However, it's essential to note that the premise is presented in a humorous and tongue-in-cheek manner, which might not necessarily imply a literal truth. The tone of the text suggests that the speaker is poking fun at the idea of a suspicious scenario, rather than taking it seriously.  Therefore, while the premise is plausible, it is not a conclusive proof that Everett was missing, and it's essential to consider the context and tone of the text to draw a more serious conclusion."	394
1760474009	1760474010	Premise: His hair was white, as my daughters reported when they went to view the body before it was given to the Odonata. Now he is known as The Man Who Changed the World, and there are statues to him everywhere. No one remembers he had a younger brother.  Hypothesis: The Man Who Changed the World had a younger brother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	This premise entails the hypothesis in the sense that it suggests a causal relationship between the Man Who Changed the World and the presence of a younger brother. The premise establishes that the Man Who Changed the World was given a white hair, which implies that he was once human. The presence of a younger brother also implies that the Man Who Changed the World was once human as well. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the Man Who Changed the World had a younger brother.	95
1760474010	1760474010	Premise: Oh, I did, I did! I was lucky. I would have liked brothers and sisters but I don't remember that I was ever lonely.  Hypothesis: she was ever lonely  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""I did, I did. I was lucky. I would have liked brothers and sisters but I don't remember that I was ever lonely"" seems to imply a self-contradictory situation.  The premise states that the speaker had brothers and sisters, but then immediately after, it says ""I don't remember that I was ever lonely."" This creates a contradiction, as having siblings implies a sense of companionship and social interaction, which typically leads to feelings of loneliness.  Therefore, it seems that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise provides information that contradicts the hypothesis."	123
1760474010	1760474011	Premise: Her priggishness. I admire it. I know she does wrong things she tries to organize other people's lives she can't see Mr Knightley is a man in a million.  Hypothesis: Mr Knightley is a man in a million  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	This premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that the protagonist admires Mr. Knightley's priggishness and knows that he does wrong things, which suggests that Mr. Knightley's behavior is not admirable. This implies that the protagonist sees something in Mr. Knightley that is admirable, which is his integrity or moral character.  The premise also states that Mr. Knightley is a man in a million, which is a metaphorical expression that means he is exceptionally talented, successful, or accomplished. This phrase is meant to convey that Mr. Knightley is a paragon of virtue or a role model, which is the opposite of the protagonist's perception of him.  Therefore, the premise sets the stage for the hypothesis that Mr. Knightley is indeed a man in a million, as it establishes his moral character and sets up a contrast with the protagonist's admiration for him.	182
1760474011	1760474011	Premise: Only she herself knew the evil thoughts she had and how effortlessly they could be translated into action. ``I 'll make a cup of tea.'' No she would not tell Peter that the person he loved most in the world was dead.  Hypothesis: the person Peter loved most in the world was dead  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that only she herself knew the evil thoughts she had and how they could be translated into action, implying that the thoughts were internal to her. However, the hypothesis states that the person Peter loved most in the world was dead. This suggests that the person in question is outside of the narrator's control or agency, which contradicts the premise.   In other words, the premise sets up a situation where the narrator has control over her thoughts, while the hypothesis suggests that the person she cares about is deceased, rendering the premise's control over thoughts moot.   The premise and hypothesis are mutually exclusive, as the person in question is either alive or dead, and the narrator's control over their thoughts is not relevant in either case.	160
1760474011	1760474012	Premise: ``It's not your day, is it, dear?'' ``No, but they 've got to be done, and Shirley's making the tea.'' Ianthe had not told her mother that she sometimes had to dust the books in the library.  Hypothesis: Ianthe sometimes had to dust the books in the library  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, it does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states ""It's not your day, is it, dear"" and ""No, but they've got to be done, and Shirley's making the tea"" which are two distinct statements.   The statement ""Ianthe had not told her mother that she sometimes had to dust the books in the library"" is a statement about Ianthe's behavior, but it does not imply that dusting books is a part of her day.   Therefore, the premise is setting up a situation and Ianthe's behavior, but it does not directly relate to the hypothesis about dusting books."	129
1760474012	1760474012	Premise: He pulled occasionally, his arms tiring. Conker slowed a little, but the branches were coming too fast, he had to lean right forward and couldn't use his hands. He remembered the gate at the end of the track had time to hope it was open because he didn't think Conker could jump it.  Hypothesis: Conker could jump the gate  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise describes Conker's condition, stating that he ""pulled occasionally"" and that his arms are ""tiring"". This implies that Conker is in a state of exhaustion or strain, which would make it unlikely that he could jump the gate.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Conker ""could jump the gate"". This is not supported by the premise, which suggests that Conker is not in a state of optimal physical condition to jump the gate.  Therefore, the premise provides insufficient information to support the hypothesis."	121
1760474012	1760474013	Premise: But he ended up eating it himself. I was reluctant to kiss my mother, afraid that somehow her weakness and unhappiness would infect me. Naturally I didn't think for a minute that my life and spirit could stimulate her.  Hypothesis: her life and spirit could stimulate her mother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise and hypothesis appear to be related, but not necessarily entail each other.   The premise is about a character who is hesitant to kiss their mother because of her potential to ""inflict"" unhappiness. This suggests that the character's primary concern is the potential negative impact on their mother's well-being.   The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that ""her life and spirit could stimulate her mother."" This implies that the character believes that their mother's life and spirit have the potential to positively affect her mother.   While it's possible that the character's mother might indeed have a positive impact on their mother's life and spirit, the premise suggests that the character's hesitation to kiss her is motivated by fear of this potential positive effect, rather than a genuine belief in the positive impact."	161
1760474013	1760474013	Premise: ``Ely,'' I said (that was her name and the first time I 'd ever used it), ``I want to be free.'' She looked stunned. I don't think she 'd considered this.  Hypothesis: Ely had considered him wanting to be free  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that ""Ely said (that was her name and the first time I 'd ever used it),"" which implies that Ely is the one who used the name ""Ely"" for the first time. This does not necessarily mean that Ely had considered wanting to be free. The word ""used"" implies a past action, whereas ""considered"" is a future action. The premise establishes a fact about Ely's past, but does not imply that she had any thoughts or feelings about wanting to be free.   Therefore, the hypothesis ""Ely had considered him wanting to be free"" cannot be logically derived from the premise."	144
1760474013	1760474014	Premise: I'm sorry, I 've put you in an invidious position. If you're being run by Morton, he 'll want to hear all this. It won't do any harm but I 'd rather not give him food for thought because I consider him an idiot and I don't think he's capable of interpreting it correctly.  Hypothesis: Morton is capable of interpreting this food for thought correctly  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	This premise suggests that Morton is being run by someone else, implying that he is being manipulated or controlled in some way. However, the premise does not explicitly state that Morton is being run by someone else.  Therefore, I would argue that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that Morton is capable of interpreting this food for thought correctly, and this premise does not provide any information that would support this claim.   The premise only establishes that Morton is being manipulated, but it does not imply that he is being run by someone else, which is necessary for the hypothesis to be true.	121
1760474014	1760474014	Premise: The big Norwegian shook his head, frowning. ``Jeg fonstAr ikke.'' I don't think he found Ward's accent at all easy and anyway like many foreigners he found it easier to speak English than to understand it.  Hypothesis: the big Norwegian found Ward's accent at all easy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that the big Norwegian ""frowned"" when he didn't find Ward's accent easy, implying that he thought Ward's accent was difficult to understand. However, the premise does not provide any information about Ward's accent being difficult to understand. In fact, it only states that the big Norwegian thought Ward's accent was easier to understand than his own. Therefore, the premise does not support the hypothesis that the big Norwegian found Ward's accent easy."	104
1760474014	1760474015	Premise: You really don't know anything about me, do you, despite all that wallowing in my mind? As it happens I don't think I'm the right person to lead humanity into the future no.  Hypothesis: she is the right person to lead humanity into the future  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"I can analyze the premise and the hypothesis.  The premise states: ""You really don't know anything about me, despite all that wallowing in my mind."" This suggests that the speaker is aware of their own thoughts and feelings, which implies introspection and self-awareness. However, it also implies a lack of knowledge about the other person, which seems contradictory.  The hypothesis is: ""She is the right person to lead humanity into the future""  The hypothesis suggests that the speaker believes the person in question is the ideal candidate to guide humanity into the future. This is a reasonable hypothesis, as many people believe that certain individuals possess unique qualities or characteristics that make them well-suited to lead and shape the future.  However, the premise implies that the speaker is uncertain about their own abilities or qualifications to lead, which makes it difficult to evaluate the hypothesis. The speaker's self-doubt and lack of knowledge about the other person could lead them to believe that the person in question is not the right person for the job.  In other words, the premise and the hypothesis are related but distinct. The premise is about the speaker's own feelings and doubts, while the hypothesis is about the other person's potential to lead humanity into the future. The speaker's self-doubt about their own abilities is a necessary part of the premise, but it also creates a tension that makes it difficult to evaluate the hypothesis."	288
1760474015	1760474016	Premise: It's where the bands practise. I can't remember what band Petra's in, but I seen them practise once. They were OK but I didn't think they was brilliant.  Hypothesis: Petra's band was brilliant  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise is: ""It's where the bands practise.""  The hypothesis is: ""Petra's band was brilliant.""  The premise is incomplete and lacks specific information about Petra. The premise implies that Petra is a band that practices, but it doesn't provide any details about what Petra is or what kind of music they play.  The premise is not sufficient to support the hypothesis, as it lacks concrete information about Petra's nature (e.g. genre, style, level of fame, etc.). Therefore, it's not a strong foundation for making a claim about the quality of Petra's music.  A more effective hypothesis might be: ""Petra's music is brilliant"" or ""Petra's band is brilliant."""	147
1760474016	1760474016	Premise: She swallowed hard, unsure if she had the nerve to go ahead. The memory of the pain in Tara's eyes last night decided her. Did he really expect her to believe that Tara was only the housekeeper?  Hypothesis: Tara was only the housekeeper  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise presents a situation where Tara is unsure if she can go ahead due to the pain in Tara's eyes, implying that there might be some issue with Tara's condition. However, the premise does not mention anything about Tara being the housekeeper. The fact that she is unsure about going ahead is due to her concern about Tara's condition, not because she is the housekeeper.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Tara is only the housekeeper. This is a separate statement that needs to be tested or proven or disproven through the events of the story. The premise only sets up the situation, and the hypothesis is a separate inference that needs to be supported by the story.	153
1760474016	1760474018	Premise: If there are spirits at work at the time, they come only from yourself, not from the fume of the incense. Why should spirits aid living beings? What arrogance is it that drives people to believe they can have power over them?  Hypothesis: people can have power over spirits  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This is a classic example of a philosophical paradox known as the ""argument from personal responsibility"" or the ""argument from personal autonomy."" It suggests that individuals should be held accountable for their actions because they believe they have the power to shape their own lives and the lives of others.  In this case, the premise ""If there are spirits at work at the time, they come only from yourself, not from the fume of the incense"" implies that the power to aid living beings is a product of personal agency, self-awareness, and self-control. This perspective assumes that individuals are capable of making choices and taking action, which in turn allows them to exert influence over the world around them.  The hypothesis that people can have power over spirits is a more nuanced and complex idea that is supported by various philosophical and scientific perspectives. Here's why:  1. **Self-awareness and consciousness**: The concept of spirits implies a level of self-awareness and consciousness, which is a fundamental aspect of human experience. People have the capacity to reflect on their thoughts, emotions, and actions, which enables them to make decisions and take control over their lives. 2. **Self-control and agency**: The idea that people can exert influence over spirits suggests that they have the ability to control their own lives, including their thoughts, emotions, and actions. This is a key aspect of personal responsibility, which is a fundamental concept in ethics and moral philosophy. 3. **Evolutionary and psychological perspectives**: Research in psychology and evolutionary biology suggests that humans have an innate capacity for self-awareness, self-regulation, and social behavior. This capacity for self-awareness and agency is thought to have evolved to enable individuals to adapt to their environment, form social relationships, and make decisions that benefit themselves and others. 4. **Social and cultural influences**: Humans have a strong desire for autonomy and self-determination, which is reflected in various cultural and social norms that promote individual freedom, responsibility, and agency.  However, it's essential to note that the argument from personal responsibility is not without its limitations. Some potential criticisms include:  * **Cultural and historical context**: Different cultures and historical periods have varying levels of emphasis on personal agency and self-awareness, which can influence the way people perceive their own power and responsibility. * **Cognitive biases and limitations**: Human cognition is subject to various biases and limitations, such as confirmation bias, which can affect how people perceive and understand the nature of spirits and their relationship with the physical world. * **Alternative explanations**: The concept of spirits can be explained by other factors, such as the influence of environment, genetics, or social and cultural factors, which can shape human behavior and decision-making.  In conclusion, the premise and hypothesis presented in your question are not mutually exclusive. While the argument from personal responsibility acknowledges the complexity of human agency and the importance of self-awareness and self-control, it is not the only explanation for the power of spirits. However, the idea that people can have power over spirits is a compelling and thought-provoking concept that highlights the importance of considering the interplay between personal agency, self-awareness, and the social and cultural context in which we live."	653
1760474018	1760474020	Premise: Why should this topic matter? You talked about everything else as you usually do. Why should I feel Maelmuire is important?  Hypothesis: Maelmuire is important  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"I didn't actually discuss Maelmuire in our previous conversation. This is the start of our conversation, and I don't have any prior information to draw upon.  However, I can provide some general reasons why the topic of Maelmuire might be important:  1. **Historical significance**: Maelmuire is a city in western Ireland, and it's believed to be the site of the Battle of Maelmuire, a significant event in Irish history. Understanding this event could provide insights into Ireland's past and its struggle for independence. 2. **Cultural significance**: Maelmuire has been associated with the legendary figure of Máel Muirge, a 6th-century Irish king, and the city is also known for its rich cultural heritage, including its medieval architecture and traditions. 3. **Archaeological importance**: Maelmuire has been extensively excavated, and its archaeological site has yielded valuable insights into the lives of ancient Irish people, including their daily activities, social structures, and ways of life. 4. **Tourism and economic benefits**: Maelmuire is a popular tourist destination, attracting visitors interested in history, culture, and heritage. Investing in Maelmuire could bring economic benefits to the local community and the region.  As for whether the premise entails the hypothesis, I choose ""yes"" because:  1. The premise ""Maelmuire is important"" is a statement that sets the stage for a discussion about the significance of Maelmuire. 2. The hypothesis ""Maelmuire is important"" is a conclusion that can be drawn from the premise, assuming the premise is true. 3. The hypothesis is a logical conclusion that can be inferred from the premise, given the context of the topic.  However, it's essential to note that the hypothesis is not explicitly stated in our conversation, and we haven't discussed any specific topic related to Maelmuire."	405
1760474020	1760474022	Premise: It is all very well, in these changing times, to adapt one's work to take in duties not traditionally within one's realm. But bantering is of another dimension altogether. For one thing how would one know for sure that at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected?  Hypothesis: at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	This premise suggests that a bantering response is always what is expected. To test this hypothesis, we can consider several aspects of human behavior and communication:  1. **Contextual understanding**: In most cases, the context of the conversation determines the expected response. A bantering tone might be expected in a social setting, but it's less likely to be expected in a formal or professional setting. This implies that the premise might be too absolute, and the expected response might vary depending on the context. 2. **Relationship dynamics**: The tone of the conversation can reveal a person's relationship with the other person. In a close friendship or a social relationship, a bantering tone might be expected in a personal setting, but not in a professional or formal one. This suggests that the premise might be too absolute, as the expected response might vary depending on the relationship dynamics. 3. **Personality and communication styles**: Individuals with different personalities or communication styles might respond differently to banter, even if the context remains the same. For example, someone who is more outgoing and playful might be more likely to engage in banter, while someone who is more reserved might avoid it. This implies that the premise might not be absolute, as the expected response can vary based on individual characteristics. 4. **Power dynamics**: In some cases, a bantering response might be expected in a situation where power imbalances exist. For example, in a workplace, a boss might be expected to be more formal and less likely to engage in banter with an employee. This suggests that the premise might not be absolute, as the expected response can be influenced by power dynamics.  Considering these aspects, the hypothesis that a bantering response is always what is expected is not supported. The premise is too absolute and does not account for the complexities of human behavior, relationships, personality, and power dynamics.  To test the hypothesis, one could design an experiment or a study that investigates how people respond to bantering in different contexts, considering the factors mentioned above. This could involve:  * Conducting surveys or questionnaires to gather data on people's responses to banter in different contexts * Analyzing social media posts or online forums to observe the types of banter that are more or less likely to be responded to * Conducting focus groups or interviews to explore the differences in responses to banter in various relationships * Investigating the role of personality, power dynamics, and other factors that can influence the response to banter	505
1760474022	1760474022	Premise: But the horror of losing was as much to do with money as with pride. Biddy had never let them down, come without fail all through the bad weather, and now was giving Nails an intensive course on her own horse which - in terms of money - was worth another couple of hundred pounds. Yet surely she knew they had no way of paying should she demand it?  Hypothesis: they had no way of paying  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise and the hypothesis are related but not directly entail each other.  The premise establishes a situation where Biddy has successfully completed an intensive course without any financial difficulties, implying that she has sufficient financial resources to pursue her interests without worrying about money. This premise sets a positive tone and establishes a context for the narrative.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that Biddy would be unable to afford to pay Nails for the course, which is the main character. However, the premise does not directly imply that the course is worth more than Biddy's financial resources. In fact, it explicitly states that Nails' course is worth ""another couple of hundred pounds,"" which is a relatively modest amount.  Therefore, the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. The hypothesis is more of a consequence of the premise, suggesting that Biddy's situation is so dire that she would be unable to afford the course, but the premise does not provide any evidence for this outcome."	199
1760474022	1760474023	Premise: I ducked so fast I wasn't sure whether he 'd seen me or not, but it gave me a prickly feeling just to imagine it, so I scuttled for the door and legged it up the spiral stairway three steps at a time, just in case. As I ran, I remember thinking stupid thoughts like. How did he know I was up here looking down?  Hypothesis: he was up there looking down  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise sets up a situation where the protagonist is in a confined, enclosed space (the stairway) and is trying to escape or avoid someone (him). The key elements that suggest the hypothesis is supported are:  1. The protagonist is trying to escape or avoid someone, which implies a sense of urgency or fear. 2. The protagonist's actions (ducking, scuttling) are driven by a fear or uncertainty about being seen, which further supports the idea that the protagonist is trying to avoid detection. 3. The protagonist's thoughts, such as ""How did he know I was up here looking down?"" suggest that the protagonist is aware of the potential threat and is trying to assess the situation.  However, there are some counterpoints to consider:  1. The protagonist's thoughts are somewhat speculative and open-ended, which may suggest that the protagonist is unsure of the situation or is not entirely sure what they are trying to avoid. 2. The protagonist's actions are also driven by a desire to escape, rather than a specific fear of being seen. This may suggest that the protagonist is not necessarily trying to avoid detection, but rather trying to escape the situation.  Overall, while the premise sets up a compelling scenario, the hypothesis that the protagonist is trying to avoid detection is not explicitly stated, and the protagonist's thoughts and actions could be driven by a variety of motivations. The premise does not provide enough information to conclude that the hypothesis is correct."	301
1760474023	1760474024	Premise: At the heart of the universe there is cruelty. We are predators and are preyed upon, every living thing. Did you know that wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds piercing the weak spot in their armour?  Hypothesis: wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise, while intriguing, does not entail the hypothesis. The premise is a fact about wasps and ladybirds, stating that wasps pierce the weak spot in ladybirds to lay their eggs. However, this does not imply that wasps are predators that prey on ladybirds. The premise does not provide any information about the behavior or characteristics of wasps or ladybirds that would suggest a predator-prey relationship.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, proposes a specific relationship between wasps and ladybirds, which is not supported by the premise. To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to provide additional information that links wasps to ladybirds in a predator-prey relationship.  To illustrate, if we were to revise the premise to something like:  ""We are predators that prey on the weak and vulnerable, and we are often harmed by the strong and resilient.""  This revised premise would entail the hypothesis, as it suggests a predator-prey relationship between wasps and ladybirds."	204
1760474024	1760474025	Premise: ``I wanted to tell you. But the Bookman asked me to keep our meeting a secret.'' How did you know I 'd met him?  Hypothesis: he had met the Bookman  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to analyze the given statement and see if it logically leads to the hypothesis.  The premise states that ""I wanted to tell you. But the Bookman asked me to keep our meeting a secret.""  From this statement, we can infer that the speaker (the person who is speaking) did not want to reveal their plans to tell someone else. This implies that the speaker had some sort of information or secret that they wanted to keep.  The hypothesis states that ""he had met the Bookman."" To test this hypothesis, we need to see if the speaker's actions (or lack thereof) support or contradict this statement.  If the speaker wanted to tell someone else, it's likely that they would have shared this information, either with them or with others, as part of the original conversation. However, the fact that the Bookman asked the speaker to keep the meeting a secret suggests that the speaker is trying to conceal something from the Bookman.  Therefore, the premise does entail the hypothesis, because the speaker's actions (or lack thereof) imply that they had a secret or information that they wanted to keep from the Bookman."	242
1760474025	1760474025	Premise: She rubbed them away with an angry fist. She was a fool to let anyone get round her. How long before she learned that folk 'll always take advantage of weakness?  Hypothesis: folk 'll always take advantage of weakness  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise is stating a general rule or characteristic (people taking advantage of weakness) and describing a character's reaction to it (rubbing away with an angry fist). The premise is setting up a situation, but it doesn't directly relate to the character's likely response (letting anyone get away with it). The character's reaction (rubbing away with an angry fist) is a consequence of the premise, but it's not a prediction based on the premise.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a specific prediction that people will take advantage of weakness. The premise is more of a general statement about people, while the hypothesis is a statement about the behavior of individuals.  A better hypothesis might be: ""People will take advantage of individuals with a history of being taken advantage of, especially if they feel vulnerable or powerless."" This hypothesis is more specific and makes a prediction based on the premise, and it's more likely to be supported by evidence."	205
1760474025	1760474026	Premise: At length she decided that there was nothing to be gained by worrying her. Probably there was some quite innocent explanation, which Roger Kenyon would give her when she returned the wallet - if, indeed, it were his. And yet why had his manner changed so abruptly when he learned that the girl whose hat he had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage?  Hypothesis: the girl whose hat Roger Kenyon had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	This premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise sets up a situation where Roger Kenyon rescues a hat from a girl at Sunset Cottage, and then later learns she is going to live there. This information does not necessarily imply that the girl is going to live at Sunset Cottage. The premise only establishes a fact about the hat, and there is no connection to the girl or the setting. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a specific conclusion that must be supported by evidence from the text.	103
1760474026	1760474027	Premise: Anna looked at Peter again and said to herself in a guilty whisper, ``Will he become even more difficult?'' She wondered if a stranger could tell that he was difficult, just by looking at him. Would such a person watching Peter now reading the prayers of Rite B in his level pleasant voice notice that resentment lay like his blood just under his skin because the life he had chosen had not turned out as he had expected it to?  Hypothesis: resentment lay just under Peter's skin  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise is a statement that Peter, the protagonist, is being observed by a stranger (presumably the narrator) who is watching him read the prayers of Rite B. The premise implies that Peter is being judged or evaluated by this stranger, but it does not provide any information about how the stranger will perceive Peter's actions or emotions.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that ""resentment lay just under Peter's skin,"" which is a statement about Peter's emotional state, not the stranger's perception of him. The stranger is not being observed or evaluated, but rather the narrator is speculating about Peter's emotional state based on her observation.  Additionally, the premise does not provide any information about the stranger's perspective or motivations, so it is impossible to determine if the stranger will notice resentment in Peter's eyes or voice. The premise is more focused on Peter's internal state, whereas the hypothesis is more focused on the stranger's potential observation and reaction."	208
1760474027	1760474027	Premise: Jean was tough and liked to drink. She would endure for a long while yet. But what would she do when she realized that with things as they were she was on a life sentence not just a temporary suspension of essential pleasure?  Hypothesis: Jean was on a life sentence  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise sets up a scenario where Jean is facing a life sentence, implying a permanent and indefinite period of restriction on her freedom. The hypothesis, on the other hand, proposes that Jean is not facing a life sentence, but rather a temporary suspension of essential pleasure.  The key difference between the two is that the premise establishes a permanent restriction on Jean's freedom, whereas the hypothesis proposes a temporary suspension of pleasure. The premise implies that Jean's life is being taken away from her, whereas the hypothesis suggests that she is being given a reprieve.  If Jean is indeed on a life sentence, it would mean that she is facing an indefinite period of restriction on her freedom, which is not supported by the premise. The premise is setting up a scenario where Jean's freedom is being taken away, whereas the hypothesis is proposing a temporary reprieve. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.	196
1760474027	1760474028	Premise: ``Clever''. Klug means ``clever''. Would you say that Abie was clever?  Hypothesis: Abie was clever  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""Klug means 'clever'"" is a clever play on words. However, it does not necessarily entail the hypothesis ""Abie was clever"".   The word ""Klug"" is a German word that is often translated as ""clever"" or ""cleverness"". It can also be used as an adjective to describe something as clever or cunning. Therefore, the premise is a linguistic definition, not a fact about Abie, which would make it not entail the hypothesis.  In logic, a hypothesis and a premise are related, but they are not necessarily equivalent. A hypothesis is a statement that predicts what might happen, while a premise is a statement that provides information about what is known. The premise is more of a definition or a description of the word ""clever"", whereas the hypothesis is a specific claim about Abie.   Therefore, the premise does not logically entail the hypothesis."	184
1760474028	1760474029	Premise: The Susweca. It means ``dragonfly'' in Sioux, you know. Did I ever tell you that's where Paul and I met?  Hypothesis: Susweca is where she and Paul met  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"After analyzing the given premise, I'd say the hypothesis is partially supported but not entirely.  The premise states that the Susweca refers to ""dragonfly"" in Sioux. This is a linguistic fact, and dragonflies are indeed known to be found in the Susweca region, which is a part of the Sioux Native American tribe's traditional territory in North America.   However, the hypothesis suggests that Susweca is where Paul and the speaker met. While it's possible that Paul and the speaker did meet in the Susweca region, the connection between the two events is not explicitly stated. The premise does not provide enough information to establish a direct link between the Susweca region and the meeting between Paul and the speaker.  A stronger hypothesis might be that the speaker and Paul met in the Susweca region, but the premise does not provide enough evidence to confirm this. The phrase ""where she and Paul met"" could be interpreted in a variety of ways, and without further context, it's difficult to determine the exact location."	213
1760474029	1760474029	Premise: How do you know? she was going to ask, but his smile was answer enough. If DeVore said there was going to be a vacancy there would be a vacancy.  Hypothesis: there was going to be a vacancy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""she was going to ask, but his smile was answer enough. If DeVore said there was going to be a vacancy there would be a vacancy"" does not entail the hypothesis ""there was going to be a vacancy"".  The premise is stating a conditional statement (if-then) that sets up a situation, but it doesn't provide enough information to infer that a vacancy would occur. The premise only mentions DeVore saying there is a vacancy, but it doesn't provide any information about why there is a vacancy.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, is stating a conclusion that is directly supported by the premise. The premise provides the information that DeVore said there is a vacancy, which is the same thing the hypothesis is stating. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	163
1760474029	1760474030	Premise: She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked. Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit, then came out and was not very successful in finding a job to suit him. That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them.  Hypothesis: it was Edward's fault  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states that the speaker's sister Louise thinks Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit and wasn't successful in finding a job, implying that he is to blame for not finding a job that suits him.   This suggests that the speaker's sister is not questioning her brother's decision-making or his skills, but rather, she is pointing a finger at him for not being successful in his job search. The fact that she uses the term ""it was his fault"" reinforces the idea that the speaker's sister is placing blame on Edward.   The speaker does not provide any evidence or context that would suggest otherwise, which further supports the notion that the premise is the hypothesis."	143
