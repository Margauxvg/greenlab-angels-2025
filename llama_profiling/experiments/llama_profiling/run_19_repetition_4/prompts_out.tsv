1760543818	1760543818	Premise: It was a complex language. Not written down but handed down. One might say it was peeled down.  Hypothesis: the language was peeled down  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise ""It was a complex language"" suggests that the language was written down, but this is not explicitly stated.   My response would be: ""No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise is an example of a linguistic phenomenon, and its truth value depends on the interpretation of ""written down."" If ""written down"" refers to being physically written, then it is true. However, if ""written down"" refers to being transmitted through oral tradition, then it is false. Without further information, it's not clear what the premise means, and the hypothesis remains speculative."""	120	0.0
1760543818	1760543819	Premise: It is part of their religion, a religion I do not scoff at as it holds many elements which match our own even though it lacks the truth of ours. At one of their great festivals they have the ritual of driving out the devils from their bodies. First the drummers come on - I may say that no women are allowed to take part in this ritual and the ladies here will perhaps agree with me that they are fortunate in that omission.  Hypothesis: no women are allowed to take part in this ritual  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise is an example of a hypothesis in a hypothetical scenario. Here's why:  1. **Specificity of the premise**: The premise is quite specific, mentioning a particular aspect of a specific religion, which is the ritual of driving out the devils from their bodies. This specificity is a key characteristic of a hypothesis. 2. **Subjective language**: The premise uses subjective language, such as ""they have the ritual"" and ""no women are allowed,"" which implies a value judgment. This subjective language is a hallmark of a hypothesis. 3. **Omission of variables**: The premise does not mention any variables or conditions that would allow for alternative explanations. The absence of women participating in the ritual is the only variable mentioned. 4. **Unsatisfactory evidence**: The premise does not provide any evidence or data to support the hypothesis. It simply states a general claim without any concrete examples or observations.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis in the way that would allow for a logical conclusion. The hypothesis would require additional evidence or data to support the claim that no women are allowed to participate in the ritual.  However, the premise does suggest a possibility that the ritual does not involve women, which could be a part of a larger hypothesis. For example, the hypothesis might be: ""Women are not allowed to participate in the ritual."""	279	
1760543819	1760543820	Premise: The Paris to Rouen railway was being extended to Le Havre, and the line cut straight through Dr Flaubert's land. Part of it was to be compulsorily purchased. You could say that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy.  Hypothesis: Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	This premise and hypothesis do not entail each other.  The premise is about the extension of the Paris to Rouen railway, the compulsorily purchase of land, and Gustave Flaubert's possible connection to the land. However, it does not provide any information about Gustave Flaubert's health or his connection to the land.   The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests a causal relationship between Gustave Flaubert's epilepsy and his decision to be shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset.  Therefore, the premise does not provide enough information to support or refute the hypothesis, as the hypothesis is a separate statement that does not rely on the premise.	138	
1760543820	1760543820	Premise: Part of it was to be compulsorily purchased. You could say that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy. You could also say he was driven there by the railway.  Hypothesis: Gustave was driven to creative retreat in Croisset by the railway  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise states that Gustave was driven to creative retreat by the railway, which suggests a causal relationship. However, the hypothesis proposes that Gustave was driven to the creative retreat by epilepsy, which implies an alternative explanation for his movement to Croisset.  In this case, the premise sets up a cause-and-effect relationship, where the railway is the causal agent, and Gustave's movement to Croisset is the effect. The hypothesis, on the other hand, proposes an alternative explanation, where Gustave's movement to Croisset is due to epilepsy, not the railway.  The two statements are contradictory, as the premise implies that the railway is the cause, while the hypothesis suggests that epilepsy is the cause. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the hypothesis cannot be true if the premise is true.	166	
1760543820	1760543821	Premise: Some of them, like for instance the farm in Connecticut, are quite small. If I like a place I buy it. I guess you could say it's a hobby.  Hypothesis: buying places is a hobby  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise and hypothesis are related but not identical.  The premise states that some people buy places, and it implies a certain level of interest or enthusiasm for the places they buy. This could be due to various factors, such as a desire for a specific lifestyle, a need for a certain type of environment, or even just a personal preference.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that buying places is a hobby. This is a specific action that is being investigated or tested.  While the premise sets the stage for the hypothesis, it doesn't necessarily entail the hypothesis. A person might buy a place out of necessity or circumstance, but not necessarily because they enjoy the act of buying or the experience of owning a place.  For example, someone might buy a small farm in Connecticut for practical reasons (e.g., to raise livestock or grow crops), but not because they enjoy farming or owning a farm. In this case, the premise and hypothesis are related, but the hypothesis is not necessarily true.  To make the hypothesis more closely related to the premise, you might rephrase it to something like: ""Buying places is a common recreational activity for some people, often motivated by a desire for a specific lifestyle or environment."" This revised hypothesis is more closely tied to the premise, as it suggests that buying places is a common behavior among people who enjoy the experience of owning a place."	281	
1760543821	1760543822	Premise: Look, my dear, I'm not in my dotage yet, and I know I'm a grumbler and a complainer. You could say the only form of comfort I 've got are my complaints.  Hypothesis: the only form of comfort he has are his complaints  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""Look, my dear, I'm not in my dotage yet, and I know I'm a grumbler and a complainer"" does not entail the hypothesis ""the only form of comfort he has are his complaints.""  The premise describes a situation where the speaker is complaining, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the speaker is a complainer. It could also mean that the speaker is expressing frustration or dissatisfaction about something, but that doesn't imply that the only form of comfort they have is complaining.  A more accurate hypothesis would be: ""The speaker is expressing dissatisfaction and complaining about something.""  This revised premise implies that the speaker is not in their dotage yet and is expressing negative emotions, which is a more accurate representation of the situation."	156	1.0
1760543822	1760543822	Premise: Then the silence in the Zoo became complete. Woil stared around him and then suddenly with a push of his wings raised himself into the air, turned, and landed ten feet away on the back of a green bench. Creggan could see that he was afraid and that his fear was making him terribly uncertain.  Hypothesis: Woil was afraid  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise describes a situation where Woil raises his wings and lands on a bench, but it does not establish that Woil is afraid. It simply states that he is afraid. The premise does not provide any information about Woil's emotions, and the action of raising his wings is an action that could be attributed to various reasons, not just fear.  A more accurate hypothesis would be something like: ""Woil is afraid of being pushed into the air and landing on a bench."" This hypothesis provides a clear reason for Woil's action (being pushed) and a consequence (landing on a bench), and it is more logical and consistent with the information provided in the premise."	149	
1760543822	1760543823	Premise: But, of course, that just wasn't possible. Her disappointment over Jonathan, which had driven her to France in the first place, had been relegated somewhere to the back of her mind. Now in retrospect she could see that marriage to him would have been a ghastly mistake and that her reaction to discovering that he had been seeing other women while he had been engaged to her had had far more to do with wounded pride than with a wounded heart.  Hypothesis: marriage to Jonathan would have been a ghastly mistake  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise and the hypothesis are not directly related.  The premise sets up a situation where the protagonist has moved to France after a failed marriage to Jonathan, and now reflects on her past actions. She thinks that marrying Jonathan was a mistake, and her reaction to the discovery that he was seeing other women during their engagement is a result of her wounded pride.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, is ""marriage to Jonathan would have been a ghastly mistake"", which is a conclusion drawn from the premise.  The premise provides a context for the hypothesis, but it is not a direct statement of the hypothesis. The hypothesis is an independent statement that the marriage to Jonathan would have been a mistake, and the premise is a backdrop for this statement. The two are not necessarily connected, and the premise does not necessarily imply that the protagonist's reaction to Jonathan's infidelity was due to the hypothesis."	183	
1760543823	1760543824	Premise: Like now. The Community in Knockglen would defend Eve vociferously. Even some of the Sisters here in Dublin might see that the girl had a point.  Hypothesis: the girl had a point  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""Like now. The Community in Knockglen would defend Eve vociferously. Even some of the Sisters here in Dublin might see that the girl had a point"" suggests that there is a connection between the girl's actions and the reaction of the Community in Knockglen, as well as the perception of the girl's point by some of the Sisters in Dublin.  The hypothesis ""the girl had a point"" is a positive statement that is supported by the premise. The premise implies that the girl's actions or the Community's reaction is significant enough to warrant a positive evaluation, which in turn supports the hypothesis that the girl had a point.  However, the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. The premise only states that the girl's actions or the reaction of the Community is significant, but it does not necessarily imply that the girl's actions or reaction are the cause or explanation for the girl's point. It could also be the case that the girl's point is not related to the girl's actions, and the reaction of the Community is simply a coincidence or a reaction to a different factor.  Therefore, the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the girl had a point, and the hypothesis remains unproven."	252	
1760543824	1760543824	Premise: ``They have to be crushed, Bobkins!'' So saying, she marched off down the gravel path, making the kind of crunching noise Robert had thought could only be produced by the BBC sound-effects department. As they rounded the edge of the building he could see that behind the house was a vast garden.  Hypothesis: behind the house was a vast garden  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that the narrator is describing a scene where Bobkins is marching down a gravel path and making a noise that sounds like BBC sound effects, but it does not provide any information about the garden itself. It only mentions that there is a vast garden behind the house. The hypothesis is a conclusion that has not been established in the premise.	81	
1760543824	1760543825	Premise: ``Do you mind if I use your phone?'' Ronni could see that Guido's brain was whirring.  Hypothesis: Guido's brain was whirring  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states ""Premise: `Do you mind if I use your phone?'"", which is a question that Ronni is asking to get Guido's permission to use his phone. This is a request for permission, not a statement about Guido's brain activity.   The hypothesis, on the other hand, states ""Guido's brain was whirring"", which is a statement about Guido's brain activity, not a request for permission.   To entail a premise, the hypothesis must be a direct consequence or a logical implication of the premise. In this case, there is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis."	139	
1760543825	1760543825	Premise: ``Look, lady, give me a break. I just deliver the stuff, I don't interview it for the Sunday papers.'' He waved the paper at her and even at a distance she could see that it said very little.  Hypothesis: the paper said very little  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise is a statement about someone delivering packages and not interviewing them, but it does not provide any information about what the package said or what the content is. It simply states a fact about the person delivering the package.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a statement that claims the paper said something. In order for the premise to entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to provide evidence or information that supports the hypothesis, such as the content of the paper. However, there is no such information provided in the premise, so it does not support the hypothesis.	127	
1760543825	1760543825	Premise: ``You 've heard something like that before. Haven't you, Jimmy?'' Jimmy had been shaken by those sounds more shaken than the others for good reason but Cardiff could see that he was unprepared to show it as he pushed himself away from the reception counter.  Hypothesis: Jimmy was unprepared to show he had been shaken  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise is setting a scene and establishing the situation, but it does not provide any information about Jimmy's emotional state or reaction to the sounds. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a specific claim about Jimmy's emotional state that is not supported by the premise.  The premise simply states that Jimmy was shaken by the sounds, but it does not imply that he was unprepared to show it. It's possible that Jimmy might be shaken, but we don't know for sure, and the premise does not provide any evidence to support this claim.	122	
1760543825	1760543826	Premise: It was Alan's idea. He made a sour kind of joke out of it, that they must wait until their wedding night. Carolyn agreed because she could see he meant it although she didn't understand why.  Hypothesis: Alan meant it  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise states that Alan made a joke about waiting until their wedding night, which implies that he is planning to wait until after the wedding. However, the hypothesis states that Alan meant it, which suggests that he actually plans to do the exact opposite - wait until after the wedding.  The premise only says that Carolyn agreed to the joke, not that Alan intended to do it. It doesn't establish that he actually means it. Therefore, the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that Alan meant it.	115	
1760543826	1760543826	Premise: And why bother to write anyway? What was there to say? Mary had some vague idea that Adam's parents might suspect he was down here and come to see him.  Hypothesis: Adam was down here  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise and hypothesis are related but not identical.  The premise states: ""Mary had some vague idea that Adam's parents might suspect he was down here.""  This premise implies a lack of concrete information or evidence about Adam's whereabouts, which creates a sense of uncertainty and raises questions about the potential consequences of his actions.  The hypothesis, ""Adam was down here,"" is a conclusion that can be drawn from the premise. It is a statement that directly follows from the premise, assuming that there is indeed some indication or evidence that Adam is present at the location.  In other words, the premise sets up a situation where the hypothesis can be logically derived from it. The premise provides a context for the hypothesis to make sense, and the hypothesis provides a specific conclusion based on that context.  Therefore, the premise does entail the hypothesis, as it sets the stage for the hypothesis to be true."	182	
1760543826	1760543827	Premise: ``And you're not having this dress,'' Nora said, bending down to look at the price tag. ``It's two and a half guineas!'' she hissed at Louise who could tell that she was genuinely appalled.  Hypothesis: Nora was genuinely appalled  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise is stating that Nora is reacting to the price of the dress, but it doesn't provide any information about Louise's emotional state or reaction. It simply states that Nora is ""genuinely appalled"", which is a statement about Nora's emotional state, not Louise's. The hypothesis would need additional information to be confirmed, such as Louise's reaction or a specific reason why Nora is appalled by the price."	97	
1760543827	1760543827	Premise: She said good morning to Alice and Alice said hallo. She was thin and rather tall with a very lined gentle face and hair that was white but which Alice could see had once been blonde. She could also have told this was Tina's mother before Mrs Darne went off down the passage that led to the Headmaster's Flat.  Hypothesis: this was Tina's mother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	This premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise describes a person with the following characteristics:  - Thin and tall - A very lined face - Hair that is white but once had blonde hair - A gentle face  However, it does not mention any distinctive features such as blue eyes, a nose, or any other physical characteristics that are typically associated with Tina's mother.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the person is Tina's mother, but it does not describe any specific physical characteristics that would link her to Tina. Therefore, the premise does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis.	124	
1760543827	1760543828	Premise: She might have sat all afternoon, nibbling and stuporous, exhausted but not sleepy. But the glazier finally came down from the upper floor, cheerfully announcing that all was now right and tight and he would be on his way. Maggie could tell that he would have liked to stop for a chat that he felt sorry for her left on her own but she lacked either her grandmother's grace or her mother's energy so she did not offer him tea.  Hypothesis: the glazier would have liked to stop for a chat  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise states that Maggie is sitting all afternoon, feeling exhausted, and not sleepy, which is a description of her physical state. However, the glazier's action of stopping by to visit her and offering to help with a problem suggests that he might have had a reason for stopping, but it does not necessarily imply that he would have liked to stop for a chat.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the glazier would have liked to stop for a chat. The premise does not provide any information about the glazier's intentions or motivations, and it is not clear whether they would have had a reason to stop by to chat. The phrase ""he felt sorry for her"" implies that the glazier is motivated by sympathy, but it does not necessarily mean that they would have chosen to stop for a chat. Therefore, the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis."	194	
1760543828	1760543829	Premise: Jim waited. He waited a long time, and when the young doctor finally came out, it was almost dark. Jim could nonetheless tell by his anxious face that something was wrong.  Hypothesis: something was wrong  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise entails the hypothesis. Here's why:  1. **The premise is a statement of fact**: The story begins with ""Jim waited"" and ""he could tell by his anxious face that something was wrong"". This establishes a factual statement that sets up the situation. 2. **The premise provides context**: The premise gives us a situation where Jim is waiting, which implies that something is happening or is expected to happen. 3. **The premise includes a sensory detail**: The phrase ""by his anxious face"" is a sensory detail that provides information about Jim's emotional state. 4. **The premise implies a change in the situation**: The fact that Jim is able to tell by his anxious face suggests that something has changed, and that something is wrong.  Given these points, it's reasonable to conclude that the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise sets the stage for the situation, provides context, and includes a key sensory detail that suggests a change in the situation, which is a crucial element in forming a hypothesis."	211	
1760543829	1760543829	Premise: ``Yes?'' ``Nathan?'' He could tell it was long-distance the line was so gravelly and hollow but he didn't recognise the voice.  Hypothesis: the call was long-distance  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise states that the line is ""gravelly and hollow,"" which implies that the voice is coming from a distance. However, the hypothesis states that the voice is ""long-distance.""   Since the premise is describing the sound quality, which is related to distance, it's more accurate to say that the premise is describing the ""tone"" or ""sound quality"" of the voice, rather than ""the line itself."""	86	
1760543829	1760543829	Premise: Chopra stood unsteadily on his feet. The shapechanger bounded around with excitement. Chopra could tell something had happened.  Hypothesis: something had happened  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that Chopra ""stood unsteadily on his feet"", which is a physical description of a state of being unsteady or unstable. However, the hypothesis is ""something had happened"", which is a statement that requires evidence or a cause to be proposed.  In order for the premise to entail the hypothesis, the hypothesis would need to be a direct result or consequence of the physical state described in the premise. Since the premise does not provide any information about what happened, it is impossible to conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the premise alone.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	134	
1760543829	1760543830	Premise: It seemed impossible that anyone could endure such pain for so long, but at last the doors of the Renault slammed and there was comparative silence. The engine was started up, revving violently as the car was turned round on the narrow road. John could tell that it was being driven back up the hill towards Putna.  Hypothesis: the car was being driven back up the hill towards Putna  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise (""It seemed impossible that anyone could endure such pain for so long"") and the hypothesis (""the car was being driven back up the hill towards Putna"") are two separate statements.  The premise is stating that something (the car) is experiencing extreme pain, which is unlikely. This implies that the car is not just a simple statement, but a statement about the car itself, not the person driving it.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a statement about what is happening with the car, which is being driven back up the hill towards Putna. The hypothesis is not related to the premise, as it is a separate statement about the car's actions.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise is describing a situation, while the hypothesis is describing a specific action."	165	
1760543830	1760543831	Premise: Just when you think you 've got it straight, along comes the Fool with his pig's bladder and whops you on the nose. By the way, I'm no idiot. I could tell Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see me at the airport.  Hypothesis: Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see her at the airport  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""Just when you think you've got it straight, along comes the Fool with his pig's bladder and whops you on the nose"" suggests that the main character has been misjudging or overestimating their own abilities or knowledge. The Fool's actions (whipping someone on the nose) are a classic idiomatic expression meaning to mock or belittle someone.  Given this premise, it's unlikely that the main character is actually an idiot or that they could tell that Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see them at the airport. Instead, the premise seems to imply that the main character has made a mistake or overestimated their own abilities, which is then reinforced by the punchline.  Therefore, the hypothesis that ""Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see her at the airport"" seems to be a separate statement that is not directly supported by the premise. The premise focuses on the main character's self-perception and their reaction to being recognized, rather than the actual reaction of Gillian and Stuart."	209	
1760543831	1760543831	Premise: He's weird enough to have undressed me without thinking, according to some mad notion of the ``proper'' thing to do. Perhaps he thought I couldn't lie in bed with my clothes on.  Hypothesis: she couldn't lie in bed with her clothes on  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise describes a situation where someone undresses the narrator without thinking, which suggests a level of familiarity or comfort with undressing the narrator in their own home. However, it does not necessarily imply that the narrator would be comfortable or willing to lie in bed with their clothes on. The premise is more focused on the act of undressing rather than the act of lying in bed.	88	
1760543831	1760543832	Premise: That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort. Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all. But you will perhaps understand that there was a natural tendency on my part in asking what was after all a generous favour from my employer to hint that there was a good professional motive behind my request.  Hypothesis: there was a natural tendency on her part to hint that there was a good professional motive behind her request  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""that is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort"" does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise is stating a statement about Mr. Farraday's mood and behavior, but it does not provide any information about the hypothesis. The hypothesis is a separate statement that is being tested or inferred based on the premise.  The premise does not contain any information that would lead us to conclude that Mr. Farraday was likely to be in a lighthearted, humorous mood at the time of the conversation, or that he would be open to discussing professional motives. Therefore, the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis."	161	
1760543832	1760543832	Premise: But don't dilly-dally for too long. Once it's published we are all going to look a little risible if we have made no adjustments to what is after all known as being predominantly my own design of gallery. Also I am a bit older than the rest of you but you can perhaps understand that I don't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation.  Hypothesis: he doesn't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""But don't dilly-dally for too long"" suggests that the speaker is concerned about being seen as unprofessional or lacking in integrity if their design is not significantly changed or improved after being published. This implies that the speaker is worried about the potential consequences of their work being rejected or criticized, and is trying to mitigate this risk by advocating for changes to their design.  The hypothesis ""he doesn't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation"" is a bit unclear, but it appears to suggest that the speaker is concerned about the potential consequences of not making changes to their design. If the speaker is worried about being seen as unprofessional or lacking in integrity, it's likely that they want to demonstrate a willingness to make changes to improve their work, even if it means being vulnerable to criticism or rejection.  However, upon closer examination, the premise and hypothesis don't seem to be directly related. The premise is more about the speaker's concerns about their own reputation, while the hypothesis seems to be about the speaker's reaction to criticism or rejection of their design.   Therefore, I would say that the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	237	
1760543832	1760543833	Premise: I should dearly have liked to know whether they were Europeans or Americans, but I couldn't hear the accents. They appeared to be arguing. I hoped the white men weren't telling him to eliminate all witnesses because I don't believe it would have needed much persuasion.  Hypothesis: eliminating all witnesses would have needed much persuasion  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise entails the hypothesis.   The premise states that the white men appeared to be arguing and that it was likely they were Europeans, while the hypothesis suggests that eliminating all witnesses would have needed much persuasion. The word ""appeared"" implies that the speaker heard the argument, which is the premise. The hypothesis, therefore, is directly supported by the premise."	72	
1760543833	1760543834	Premise: But the damage was done as far as my faith was concerned, which is probably why I went mad. So anyway, that Christmas Eve night confirmed my worst fears, it was like a kind of ``royal flush'' for the infant Jimbo. All three kings - Pa Santa and the King of Kings - all down the pan together... And to be honest I don't believe any of them stands a chance of ever making a comeback with me.  Hypothesis: any of the three kings stands a chance of ever making a comeback with him  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise is a darkly comedic and satirical take on the traditional Christmas story, poking fun at the idea of Christmas as a time for redemption and forgiveness. The idea of three kings - a tyrannical and oppressive figure (Pa Santa), a corrupt figure (the King of Kings), and a benevolent figure (the King of Kings) - all being brought down by the infant Jimbo (the protagonist) is a humorous and unexpected twist.  The premise entails the hypothesis that the King of Kings, who is the most powerful figure, still has a chance of making a comeback. This is because the premise sets up a clear contrast between the benevolent King of Kings and the oppressive Pa Santa and the King of Kings. The fact that the infant Jimbo is able to bring these two down suggests that the King of Kings is not invincible and that his power is not absolute.  The premise also implies that the King of Kings has a sense of vulnerability or weakness, as he is brought down by the infant's actions. This weakness can be seen as a key aspect of the King's character, and it suggests that he is not invincible and that he can be defeated or overthrown.  Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis that the King of Kings can still make a comeback, at least to some extent.	267	
1760543834	1760543834	Premise: He had seen something I should have, which was a car turning in from Soho Square and coming up behind me. My right foot hovered over the accelerator pedal and I balanced Armstrong on the clutch. I wasn't as convinced as Malpass that Nevil was out of harm's way.  Hypothesis: Nevil was out of harm's way  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	This premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise presents a situation where the narrator is trying to escape an unknown threat, specifically the presence of an unknown car turning into the road behind them. The narrator is trying to balance the car by using the clutch pedal, and is not convinced that Nevil (likely a passenger) is out of harm's way.  However, the hypothesis is that Nevil is out of harm's way, which is not supported by the premise. Instead, the premise presents a situation where the narrator is trying to avoid an unknown threat, which is why they are trying to balance the car and use the clutch pedal.  A better hypothesis might be that the narrator is not convinced that Nevil is out of harm's way because they are in a high-stress situation and are trying to focus on avoiding the unknown threat, rather than thinking about Nevil's safety.	181	
1760543834	1760543835	Premise: Jed wondered. He 'd scarcely set eyes on him since the night they 'd had dinner together at the house in Westwood. Nobody had mentioned him either and Jed didn't feel he should ask.  Hypothesis: Jed should ask  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	This premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise sets up a situation where Jed is reflecting on a past interaction with someone (implied to be a significant other, possibly a friend or acquaintance) at a dinner party. The key element is that nobody has mentioned Jed since that night, implying a lack of communication or interaction.   This creates a situation where Jed is left with a sense of curiosity or curiosity about the person's life, which is the hypothesis. The premise establishes a clear context for the hypothesis, which is to ask the person about them.  The hypothesis is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred based on the premise.	129	
1760543835	1760543836	Premise: Yet what good came from knowing that a woman had killed herself? The children who had suffered a trauma would survive the experience, scarred by it and a little flawed by it. They would never forget that for a week they had imagined the act of murder had been committed.  Hypothesis: for a week the children had imagined the act of murder had been committed  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise sets up a fascinating scenario, exploring the psychological and emotional impact of a traumatic event on children.   While the premise hints at the potential for the children to ""imagine"" the act of murder had been committed, it's not necessarily a direct cause-and-effect relationship. The hypothesis I would propose is that the premise itself might not necessarily entail the children surviving the experience, but rather, it sets up a situation where the children might experience a significant emotional and psychological impact.  The hypothesis I would propose is that for the week the children imagined the act of murder had been committed, they would experience:  1. **Trauma**: The act of imagining such a horrific event would likely cause significant distress, anxiety, and fear, which could lead to long-term psychological trauma. 2. **Emotional scars**: The experience would likely leave a lasting impact on their emotional well-being, potentially causing feelings of guilt, shame, and anxiety related to the imagined event. 3. **Cognitive distortions**: The children might experience distorted thinking patterns, such as catastrophizing, rumination, or overestimation of the severity of the event, which could affect their daily functioning and relationships with others. 4. **Social effects**: The experience could lead to social withdrawal, decreased social skills, or difficulties in forming and maintaining relationships due to their fear and anxiety.  In contrast, the premise itself does not necessarily entail that the children would survive the experience. The traumatic event could lead to long-term consequences, such as:  1. **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**: The children might develop symptoms of PTSD, including flashbacks, nightmares, or avoidance behaviors related to the event. 2. **Anxiety and depression**: The experience could lead to increased anxiety and depression, which could affect their daily life, relationships, and overall well-being. 3. **Impact on relationships**: The children might struggle with trust, intimacy, or forming healthy relationships due to their emotional scars and trauma.  In conclusion, while the premise suggests that the children might imagine the act of murder had been committed, the hypothesis I proposed is that the premise itself sets up a situation where the children would experience significant trauma, emotional scars, and long-term psychological and social consequences."	463	
1760543836	1760543837	Premise: Nora calculated that there must be lots of single men up there so she decided it was ideal for the ``manhunt'', as we called it, even though the train fare was a serious consideration. I remember we went up to Euston together one Saturday morning, very excited, to buy the ticket in advance. It was a secret - if my parents had known she was going away alone they would have soon put the kybosh on it.  Hypothesis: Nora was going away alone  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise and hypothesis are related but not identical. The premise states that Nora calculated that there must be lots of single men at the train station, indicating that she believes there are a large number of single men in the area. The hypothesis states that Nora is going away alone, which is a conclusion that is drawn from the premise.  However, the premise is not a direct statement of the hypothesis. The premise is more of an observation about the potential number of single men at the train station, whereas the hypothesis is a specific conclusion that Nora is trying to draw from that observation.  To make the hypothesis directly entail the premise, the premise would need to be rephrased as ""If there are lots of single men at the train station, then Nora is going away alone"". This would make it clear that the premise is a necessary condition for the hypothesis, rather than a merely coincidental one."	182	
1760543837	1760543838	Premise: His mother driving the car, so happy, young-looking and fashionably dressed and his father, a big, confident man in a smart suit, smiling and turning round to say something to Simon in the back seat. Marie thought of her own mother with her frumpy clothes and ageing, lined face. No one would have guessed that she was only forty-two.  Hypothesis: Marie's mother was only forty-two  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise sets up a contrast between Marie's appearance and her mother's, which initially suggests a plausible hypothesis. Here's why:  * The description of Marie's mother as ""happy, young-looking and fashionably dressed"" creates an expectation that her mother should be young and stylish, which is reinforced by the fact that she's driving the car. * The contrast between Marie's appearance and her mother's is striking, with Marie being described as ""frumpy"" and "" ageing"", which could imply that her mother is older. * The father's comment about his wife being only 42 years old, while still smiling and confident, is an interesting twist that could potentially support the hypothesis.  However, the key to the hypothesis is the statement that Marie's mother was ""only 42"". This statement is not supported by the premise. Marie's mother is described as ""frumpy"" and "" ageing"", which suggests that she is actually much older than 42.  The premise does not provide any evidence to support the hypothesis that Marie's mother was only 42. The contrast between Marie's appearance and her mother's is presented as a contrast, but it's not a strong enough to support the idea that Marie's mother is only 42.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, and the hypothesis is not supported by the given information."	274	
1760543838	1760543838	Premise: ``I hope you are settling down and the cat is well.'' This was a lie. She did not hope the cat was well.  Hypothesis: the cat was well  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"A classic example of a ""false premise"" or a ""non sequitur"" in a logical argument.  In this case, the premise ""I hope you are settling down and the cat is well"" is a false statement, but it doesn't entail the hypothesis ""the cat was well"". The truth of the premise doesn't directly affect the truth of the hypothesis.  The hypothesis is a separate statement that requires evidence or a condition to be true. In this case, there is no indication that the cat is well, so the premise doesn't provide any information that would logically lead to the conclusion that the cat is well.  A true logical argument would require a connection between the premise and the hypothesis, such as ""If I hope you are settling down and the cat is well, then the cat is well"". In this case, there is no such connection, so the premise doesn't entail the hypothesis."	184	
1760543838	1760543839	Premise: Jane ate without pausing. Hunger was an unknown experience. She had never imagined it could actually hurt.  Hypothesis: hunger could actually hurt  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise ""Jane ate without pausing. Hunger was an unknown experience. She had never imagined it could actually hurt"" entails the hypothesis ""hunger could actually hurt"".  The premise sets up a situation where Jane is unaware of her hunger, which implies that she has not experienced hunger before. The use of the word ""unknown"" also suggests that Jane's experience of hunger is unusual or unexpected. The statement ""hunger was an unknown experience"" reinforces this idea.  The introduction of the word ""hunger"" as a noun, which is typically a physical sensation, implies that Jane is not accustomed to experiencing it. This sets up the expectation that her experience of hunger will be unusual or unexpected, which aligns with the hypothesis that hunger could actually hurt.  The use of the word ""hunger"" as a verb, which typically implies a physical sensation, also reinforces the idea that Jane's experience of hunger is unexpected, and therefore, it could potentially be hurtful. Overall, the premise creates a logical connection between the unknown and unexpected nature of Jane's experience of hunger, which supports the hypothesis that hunger could actually hurt."	231	
1760543839	1760543840	Premise: Miss Martindale had had a school, but her rigid ideas and stern manner had frightened the children, and their parents had taken them away. And gradually the school declined, until she had to give it up and retire to end her days in the white cottage with the inevitable cat as her only companion. Breeze had never imagined that digging was such hard work.  Hypothesis: digging was such hard work  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise is a classic example of a ""dunneymo"" fallacy, where the premise sets up a situation (the rigid ideas and stern manner of Miss Martindale) that leads to a conclusion (the inevitability of the school's decline). However, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The hypothesis is a separate idea that is not directly related to the premise. The premise establishes a situation (Miss Martindale's rigid ideas and stern manner), but the hypothesis is not a logical consequence of that situation. The hypothesis is a general statement about digging, which is not supported by the premise.  To make a valid argument, the hypothesis would need to be introduced as a consequence of the premise, such as: ""If Miss Martindale had a rigid ideas and stern manner, then she would have to give up the school."" However, in the given premise, the hypothesis is not explicitly stated."	189	
1760543840	1760543840	Premise: ``You don't need to worry. We're quite adequately chaperoned. Rosa is a woman of strict moral principles.'' If she knows I'm in here she's probably hovering outside the door right now.  Hypothesis: he's in here  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""You don't need to worry. We're quite adequately chaperoned. Rosa is a woman of strict moral principles"" is a statement that could be true or false.   Given the context that ""Rosa is a woman of strict moral principles"", we can infer that Rosa is likely to be present and in control of the situation. Therefore, it is more likely that she is in the room.  My reasoning is based on the fact that Rosa's strict moral principles imply that she is likely to be present and in control of the situation, which would mean that she is in the room, given that the speaker is in there."	131	1.0
1760543840	1760543841	Premise: I said you were mad to come over at this time. It's a world event. Don't you know that Venice is packed with visitors?  Hypothesis: Venice is packed with visitors  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""Venice is packed with visitors"" is a statement that describes a situation (Venice being crowded) and makes a claim about the outcome (the crowd). This is a classic example of a syllogism, a logical argument with a categorical syllogism form.  In this case, the premise ""Venice is packed with visitors"" is the antecedent (the condition), and the hypothesis ""It is packed with visitors"" is the consequent (the conclusion). The conclusion logically follows from the premise because if Venice is indeed packed with visitors, then it is reasonable to assume that it is a world event, given that it is a crowded and popular tourist destination.  In other words, the premise sets up a clear and logical connection between the two statements, and it is reasonable to assume that if Venice is packed, then it is a world event, which is the hypothesis. This is an example of a deductive argument, where the conclusion logically follows from the premise."	203	
1760543841	1760543842	Premise: And what she had said, and went on saying quietly, calmly, efficiently, was that she loved Maggie. She paid attention. At eight Maggie had not known that her grandmother was famous but she had seen that people had something in their manner when they looked at Rachel.  Hypothesis: Maggie's grandmother was famous  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise is about Maggie's grandmother's manner and the way she talks to her, and it does not provide any information about Maggie's feelings or thoughts about her grandmother's fame. The premise only mentions that Maggie's grandmother is famous, but it does not state that Maggie knows or cares about this fact.   The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a conclusion that Maggie's grandmother is famous, which is not supported by the premise. The premise does not provide any evidence or indication that Maggie is aware of her grandmother's fame, so it does not support the hypothesis.	125	
1760543842	1760543842	Premise: They 'd seen Miss Lavant on the promenade and about the town, always walking slowly, sometimes with a neat wicker basket. Kate had often thought she was beautiful. She hadn't known she was in love with Dr Greenslade who had a wife already and three children.  Hypothesis: Miss Lavant was in love with Dr Greenslade  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise and hypothesis are related, but not directly related. The premise describes Kate's perception of Miss Lavant as beautiful and her attraction to Dr. Greenslade, while the hypothesis is a direct inference based on this premise.  To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we can look at the logical structure:  * The premise states that Kate has often thought she is beautiful and that Miss Lavant is beautiful. * The hypothesis states that Miss Lavant is in love with Dr. Greenslade.  The premise establishes a subjective experience (Kate's perception) and a fact (Miss Lavant's beauty). The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a logical conclusion drawn from this subjective experience.  The premise doesn't provide any information about Miss Lavant's feelings towards Dr. Greenslade, and it doesn't imply that Miss Lavant is in love with Dr. Greenslade. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The hypothesis is a specific inference based on the premise, but it is not a logical conclusion that must be true.  A better hypothesis would be: ""Miss Lavant is in love with Dr. Greenslade."" This hypothesis is a more direct inference based on the premise."	250	
1760543842	1760543843	Premise: Did he intend everyone in the castle to know he did not want the wife he had married in such a hurry? Did he intend to ignore her completely? Then Isabel saw Ellen's stunned face and realised that her maid at least did not know she had spent the night alone.  Hypothesis: Isabel had spent the night alone  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise suggests that Isabel had a secret marriage, which implies that she had planned to keep it a secret from the rest of the castle. However, the fact that Ellen, the maid, saw Isabel's stunned face and realized she had spent the night alone suggests that Isabel may not have intended to keep the secret to herself.  The premise implies that Isabel wanted to keep her secret marriage a secret from the rest of the castle, but the fact that Ellen saw Isabel's reaction suggests that the secret was not as well kept as Isabel thought. This means that the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the hypothesis states that Isabel had spent the night alone.  In other words, the premise provides some evidence that contradicts the hypothesis.	148	0.6666666666666666
1760543843	1760543844	Premise: Most of them young, about his age, stood and talked and drank and laughed. The two girls he had noticed earlier were standing talking to some other girls. Graham hoped they all realised that just because he was standing talking to Slater that didn't mean he was gay too.  Hypothesis: Graham was gay too  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""Most of them young, about his age, stood and talked and drank and laughed"" creates an atmosphere of a social setting where people of a certain age group are likely to be around, and it mentions that Graham is among them. This implies that Graham is likely a member of this group.  The mention of Slater also suggests that the group is likely a close-knit one, and that Slater is an integral part of it. This implies that Slater is also a member of this group.  The fact that the girls are talking to other girls also suggests that the group is likely a close-knit female group, and that Slater is likely one of them.  Given these details, it is reasonable to conclude that Graham is also a member of this group, as he is among the young people, and Slater is also a part of the group. Therefore, the premise entailed the hypothesis.  However, it's also possible to interpret the premise as simply stating that Graham is among the young people, without necessarily implying that he is part of a close-knit group. In this case, the hypothesis would be ""Graham is likely gay too"" because he is among the young people, but not necessarily a part of a close-knit group."	255	
1760543844	1760543844	Premise: He said that maybe I wasn't ready to join the Party just yet. Terry's passion for equality appealed to my purer mind, and his hatred of existing authority appealed to my resentments. But although I hated inequality it didn't mean I wanted to be treated like everyone else.  Hypothesis: he wanted to be treated like everyone else  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the speaker's passion for equality appealed to their purer mind, which suggests that they are open to the idea of equality and are drawn to its ideals. However, the premise also states that the speaker hates inequality, which means they are not interested in being treated like everyone else. The speaker is actually more interested in the ideals of equality, not the reality of being treated like everyone else.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the speaker wants to be treated like everyone else, which contradicts the premise. The speaker's passion for equality and their desire to be treated like everyone else are not the same thing.	142	
1760543844	1760543845	Premise: ``Oh, my poor Folly... We 've been together for five years, Lexy and I - she practically holds that company together. Of course I gave her an ``A''. But that doesn't mean I'm having an affair with her.  Hypothesis: he is having an affair with Lexy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Based on the premise, it does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that ""Lexy practically holds that company together"" and ""I gave her an 'A'"", which suggests that Lexy is Lex's partner and is being praised and appreciated. The fact that Lexy is praised and appreciated does not imply that she is having an affair with someone else. In fact, the premise implies that Lexy is supportive and appreciative of Lex's accomplishments, which is the opposite of what would be expected if she were having an affair.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that ""he is having an affair with Lexy"". The premise does not provide any information that would support this hypothesis, and it is unlikely that Lexy would have any reason to have an affair with someone who has been praised and appreciated by her partner."	170	
1760543845	1760543845	Premise: Nevertheless, her heart sank at the thought of spending an evening with him in his present state of mind, and she was tempted to invent a sore throat in order to get out of it. But he had been very helpful over the Puddephat business, she admitted to herself, and his moods were unpredictable - he might be on top of the world by the time he arrived at the cinema. ``I'm still keen if you are '' she said brightly pretending she had not noticed anything was amiss.  Hypothesis: something was amiss  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that the protagonist is ""tempted to invent a sore throat in order to get out of spending an evening with him"", which implies that she is considering an excuse to avoid spending time with him. The fact that she is ""tempted"" and ""admitted to herself"" suggests that she is aware of her desire to avoid him, and is considering a creative solution to escape the situation.  The hypothesis, ""something was amiss"", is supported by the premise, as it sets up a situation where the protagonist is considering a creative excuse to avoid him. The tone of the passage also suggests that the protagonist is trying to deflect or avoid the issue, which further supports the hypothesis."	150	
1760543845	1760543846	Premise: What must it be like to be imprisoned here, day after day, month after month? I wonder, does he keep them chained and manacled, thought Fenella, or does he use sorcery? And so utterly immersed was she in this strange blue and green land that was not feeling strange any more that she did not even notice that she was weighing sorcery against steel chains and seriously considering the likely outcome.  Hypothesis: Fenella was weighing sorcery against steel chains  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	This premise entails the hypothesis in the following way:  *   Fenella is immersed in a strange blue and green land, which suggests that she is not just experiencing a normal environment, but is actually living in a fantastical or magical world. *   The use of sorcery is hinted at, but not explicitly stated, which implies that Fenella is not aware of her surroundings, and is instead focused on her own thoughts and emotions. *   Fenella's consideration of the outcome of using sorcery against steel chains suggests that she is weighing the pros and cons of her actions, which is a characteristic of hypothesis testing.   Therefore, this premise entails the hypothesis, as it sets up a situation in which Fenella is making a decision based on her own thoughts and emotions, and the outcome of her actions is a key aspect of the hypothesis.	171	
1760543846	1760543847	Premise: Strasbourg, Vienna, Bucharest, Istanbul, not stopping, not looking back. I saw her tossing newly gauffred curls as the open roadster headed east, away from Ollie... Temporarily I managed to re-erect my jocular facade, but inside I was panicking. He could take her away I thought he could just do that he has such power to hurt me this little furry creature who hasn't even noticed that I 've given up the weed.  Hypothesis: he has given up the weed  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise seems to suggest a narrative of a toxic and controlling relationship with a woman, who has a significant impact on the speaker's life. The description of her as ""furry"" implies a connection to animals, which may be a metaphor for her influence over the speaker.  The statement ""he could take her away"" could be interpreted as a metaphor for the speaker feeling trapped or helpless in the relationship. The phrase ""temporarily I managed to re-erect my jocular facade"" suggests that the speaker has tried to hide their true feelings or emotions, but this facade is being ""taken away"" by the woman's influence.  The phrase ""he has such power to hurt me this little furry creature"" implies that the speaker feels vulnerable and intimidated by the woman, which suggests that the speaker may have given up control or agency in the relationship.  Given these elements, it seems likely that the premise is indeed related to the hypothesis, which suggests that the speaker has given up control or agency in the relationship. The description of the woman's influence and the speaker's emotional vulnerability support this interpretation."	223	
1760543847	1760543848	Premise: It - the tractor, the boys and the bulbs in the earth - knew she had chosen for them and was coming back to them. Of course there was still love, there was healthy, growing love and its name was called Work. She had fallen in love with it so slowly and gently and sweetly that she had never noticed it had happened.  Hypothesis: falling in love had happened  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise appears to entail the hypothesis that falling in love happened. Here's why:  * The premise states that the subject (the woman) had a ""love"" that ""had happened"" to her, which suggests a causal relationship between the two concepts. * The use of the word ""fallen"" implies a sense of inevitability or inevitability of the event (falling in love), which aligns with the hypothesis. * The phrase ""gently and sweetly"" also implies a deliberate and intentional act (the subject's falling in love), which supports the hypothesis.  However, it's worth noting that the hypothesis is quite broad and doesn't provide any concrete evidence or explanation for what exactly happened. The premise focuses more on the subjective experience of the subject, while the hypothesis provides a more abstract and general statement about falling in love. Therefore, the premise doesn't directly entail the hypothesis.   A more nuanced or specific hypothesis would require more specific details about what exactly happened to the subject. For example, ""The subject fell in love after a chance encounter with a stranger, and the experience changed her perspective on life."""	231	
1760543848	1760543848	Premise: After the twelfth dot, two thirds of the way down the page, the transcript of this long session tails away into blank paper. I suppose what's happened is this. He has gone on staring out of the window thinking and she has gone on staring at him waiting with such absorption that neither of them noticed the tape had run out.  Hypothesis: the tape had run out  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	This premise and the hypothesis seem to be a plausible explanation for the situation described. Here's why:  1. The premise establishes that a significant portion of the transcript has run out of paper, suggesting that the writing process has been interrupted or halted. 2. The hypothesis is a reasonable explanation for the situation. The fact that both characters, the narrator and the person he's staring at, have been staring out of the window for extended periods, indicates that they have been lost in thought, which could have led to the tape running out. 3. The tension and anticipation in the situation, as hinted at by the narrator's and the other person's absorption, also supports the hypothesis. The fact that neither character noticed the tape running out suggests that they may have been too engrossed in their thoughts to notice the interruption. 4. The fact that the person staring out the window has no apparent motivation or reason to notice the tape running out, other than the absence of the narrator, further supports the hypothesis.  Overall, the premise and the hypothesis seem to be a logical and coherent explanation for the situation, and it's reasonable to conclude that the tape had indeed run out.	241	
1760543848	1760543849	Premise: ``His name is Matthew Blake,'' Mandy informed Charity as they descended the steps from their cabin on to the paved pathway that led to the lodge. Thankfully she hadn't even noticed that Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt and was now wearing red shorts with her white silk blouse.  Hypothesis: Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt"" implies that Charity's physical appearance has changed, specifically that she has changed from wearing a blue wrap-around skirt to wearing red shorts with a white silk blouse. The premise does not directly state that she has changed from one color to another (blue to red) but rather that she has changed from wearing a blue skirt to a different color (red). Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The hypothesis ""Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt"" is a specific instance of the premise, but the premise does not make the hypothesis a necessary condition, as the hypothesis does not specify the exact color change."	140	
1760543849	1760543849	Premise: ``These ` ere smugglers is a dangerous bunch from wot I 've ` eard!'' ``If only we could devise a safe way of laying our hands on all that money,'' murmured Pugwash, whose greed was as proverbial as his cowardice. And the pirates were so busy discussing the problem and what they would do with the reward if they won it that they didn't notice that they were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage.  Hypothesis: the pirates were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the pirates are being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage. This information is not necessary to understand the hypothesis, which is that the pirates are being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage.  The premise is describing the situation, but it does not provide any information about the pirates' actions or intentions, which is what the hypothesis is trying to explain. The hypothesis is trying to explain why the pirates are being observed from the window above, but the premise does not provide any evidence to support that conclusion.	134	
1760543849	1760543850	Premise: Ockleton, Morpurgo, Cornelius, Dysart and half a dozen others too drunk to mention. But there was so much coming and going that any one of us could have slipped out, pushed Everett through the window and slipped back again without being noticed. Damn it all we didn't even notice Everett was missing until a porter tripped over him in the quad so anything's theoretically possible.  Hypothesis: Everett was missing  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise is a classic example of a ""lateral thinking"" puzzle, often referred to as the ""Missing Person"" paradox. The premise sets up a situation where it is plausible that anything could happen, and yet, the person (Everett) is somehow still present.  The hypothesis (Everett was missing) is a logical conclusion that follows from the premise, but it's not a necessary conclusion. There are several reasons why the hypothesis might not be true:  1. **The porter tripped over Everett**: The premise mentions that the porter tripped over Everett, which means Everett was not present. This action implies that Everett was not missing. 2. **The premise mentions half a dozen others**: This phrase is likely a rhetorical device to add to the sense of chaos and possibility. It implies that many people could have slipped out and been unnoticed, which is consistent with the premise. 3. **There's no concrete evidence to support the hypothesis**: There's no concrete evidence to suggest that Everett is missing. The premise doesn't provide any information that would lead us to believe that Everett is indeed missing.  Overall, the premise sets up a scenario where it's possible for something to happen, but the hypothesis (Everett was missing) is not a necessary conclusion. The phrase ""Damn it all"" suggests that the situation is chaotic and confusing, but it doesn't necessarily imply that Everett is missing.  So, in this case, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	303	
1760543850	1760543851	Premise: His hair was white, as my daughters reported when they went to view the body before it was given to the Odonata. Now he is known as The Man Who Changed the World, and there are statues to him everywhere. No one remembers he had a younger brother.  Hypothesis: The Man Who Changed the World had a younger brother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise states that ""His hair was white, as my daughters reported when they went to view the body before it was given to the Odonata."" This implies that the Man Who Changed the World has a distinctive characteristic (his hair being white) that is not explicitly stated, but is described by others (his daughters).   The hypothesis states that ""The Man Who Changed the World had a younger brother."" This statement directly addresses the characteristic mentioned in the premise (his hair being white) and makes a claim about the existence of a brother.  Since the premise and the hypothesis share the same information, we can conclude that the premise does indeed entail the hypothesis."	134	
1760543851	1760543851	Premise: Oh, I did, I did! I was lucky. I would have liked brothers and sisters but I don't remember that I was ever lonely.  Hypothesis: she was ever lonely  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise (""I did, I did. I was lucky. I would have liked brothers and sisters but I don't remember that I was ever lonely"") and the hypothesis (""I was ever lonely"") do not entail each other.   The premise is describing a past event, while the hypothesis is a statement about the speaker's current emotional state.   In a typical logical structure, a hypothesis should be a statement that makes a prediction or explanation for a given situation. The premise in your statement provides this information, while the hypothesis is a statement that asserts a particular feeling or situation (loneliness).   Therefore, the premise and the hypothesis do not have a logical connection, and the statement is not a valid logical argument."	145	
1760543851	1760543852	Premise: Her priggishness. I admire it. I know she does wrong things she tries to organize other people's lives she can't see Mr Knightley is a man in a million.  Hypothesis: Mr Knightley is a man in a million  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise sets up a clear relationship between the narrator and Mr. Knightley, suggesting that the narrator admires his priggishness and tries to organize other people's lives. The use of the word ""priggishness"" implies that the narrator finds Mr. Knightley's behavior admirable, which implies that the narrator believes he is someone who is well-intentioned and responsible, but perhaps a bit self-righteous or insufferable.  The contrast between the narrator's admiration for Mr. Knightley's priggishness and the idea that he is ""in a million"" suggests that the narrator believes Mr. Knightley is a unique individual who is beyond the ordinary. This is reinforced by the phrase ""a man in a million,"" which implies that Mr. Knightley is exceptional, almost superhuman, in his ability to organize others' lives.  The hypothesis that ""Mr. Knightley is a man in a million"" is therefore supported by the premise. The narrator's admiration for Mr. Knightley's priggishness and the contrast between their relationship suggest that the narrator believes he is someone who is extraordinary, and the phrase ""a man in a million"" is a clear indicator of this."	247	
1760543852	1760543853	Premise: Only she herself knew the evil thoughts she had and how effortlessly they could be translated into action. ``I 'll make a cup of tea.'' No she would not tell Peter that the person he loved most in the world was dead.  Hypothesis: the person Peter loved most in the world was dead  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Based on the premise, I would say that it does not entail the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states that ""Only she herself knew the evil thoughts she had and how effortlessly they could be translated into action."" This implies that the person in question had a strong emotional connection to Peter, and their thoughts about him were intense and strong enough to cause them to act on them, even if they were not aware of it. This suggests that their love for Peter was a powerful force that could influence their actions, which is not necessarily a characteristic of the hypothesis that the person's love for Peter is not strong enough to influence their actions.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the person's love for Peter is not strong enough to influence their actions, which is the opposite of what the premise implies. The premise does not provide any information about the person's level of love for Peter, nor does it suggest that they are not capable of acting on their thoughts. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	208	
1760543853	1760543853	Premise: ``It's not your day, is it, dear?'' ``No, but they 've got to be done, and Shirley's making the tea.'' Ianthe had not told her mother that she sometimes had to dust the books in the library.  Hypothesis: Ianthe sometimes had to dust the books in the library  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, it does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Ianthe's mother told her that Shirley is making tea, but it does not mention anything about Ianthe having to dust the books in the library. The premise only mentions that Ianthe had to tell her mother that she had to dust the books in the library, but it does not establish any direct relationship between the two statements.	81	
1760543853	1760543854	Premise: He pulled occasionally, his arms tiring. Conker slowed a little, but the branches were coming too fast, he had to lean right forward and couldn't use his hands. He remembered the gate at the end of the track had time to hope it was open because he didn't think Conker could jump it.  Hypothesis: Conker could jump the gate  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise describes a situation where Conker is having trouble with his arms and is leaning forward, which suggests that he is struggling to get up or move around. The premise does not describe Conker's physical ability to jump, but rather that he is having trouble with his physical condition. Therefore, the premise does not imply that Conker has the physical capability to jump the gate.   The hypothesis, on the other hand, is ""Conker could jump the gate"", which is a statement that can be supported by the premise. The premise does not provide any information about Conker's physical ability to jump, so it is not a valid inductive inference."	144	
1760543854	1760543854	Premise: But he ended up eating it himself. I was reluctant to kiss my mother, afraid that somehow her weakness and unhappiness would infect me. Naturally I didn't think for a minute that my life and spirit could stimulate her.  Hypothesis: her life and spirit could stimulate her mother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	This premise and hypothesis do not directly relate to each other. The premise is a narrative element from a story, while the hypothesis is a proposed explanation for the premise.  However, upon closer examination, it seems that the premise is actually a narrative device used to explain the protagonist's motivation for kissing their mother. The premise suggests that the protagonist was afraid of their mother's unhappiness and wanted to avoid being infected by her negative emotions.  In this case, the premise is meant to convey the protagonist's emotional state and their reluctance to act on their desires. The hypothesis, in this case, would be a proposed explanation for why the protagonist kissed their mother, which is to avoid being infected by her unhappiness.  Therefore, the premise does entail the hypothesis, but in a more indirect way. The premise sets up the context for the hypothesis, which is the protagonist's emotional state and motivation.	181	
1760543854	1760543855	Premise: ``Ely,'' I said (that was her name and the first time I 'd ever used it), ``I want to be free.'' She looked stunned. I don't think she 'd considered this.  Hypothesis: Ely had considered him wanting to be free  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise is ""Ely said (that was her name and the first time I 'd ever used it), 'I want to be free.'"", which indicates that Ely did not say ""I want to be free"", but rather ""I want to be free."" This indicates that the premise states a statement that Ely did not make, so it does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis.  The hypothesis is ""Ely had considered him wanting to be free"", which requires Ely to have made the statement ""I want to be free"". However, the premise does not state that Ely made this statement, it only states that she said ""I want to be free""."	152	1.0
1760543855	1760543855	Premise: I'm sorry, I 've put you in an invidious position. If you're being run by Morton, he 'll want to hear all this. It won't do any harm but I 'd rather not give him food for thought because I consider him an idiot and I don't think he's capable of interpreting it correctly.  Hypothesis: Morton is capable of interpreting this food for thought correctly  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise entails the hypothesis.  Here's why:  The premise states that if you're being ""run by Morton"", it implies that you are in a situation where Morton has control over your actions or decisions. This is because ""run"" is a verb that suggests being taken control of or dominated by someone.  The hypothesis, which states that Morton is capable of interpreting the food for thought correctly, suggests that Morton has the ability to understand and interpret your thoughts or ideas.  Given that the premise establishes a situation where Morton has control over your actions (being ""run by him""), it logically follows that Morton should be able to interpret your thoughts or ideas, which is the hypothesis."	139	
1760543855	1760543856	Premise: The big Norwegian shook his head, frowning. ``Jeg fonstAr ikke.'' I don't think he found Ward's accent at all easy and anyway like many foreigners he found it easier to speak English than to understand it.  Hypothesis: the big Norwegian found Ward's accent at all easy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""The big Norwegian shook his head, frowning"" does not entail the hypothesis ""The big Norwegian found Ward's accent at all easy.""  The premise sets up a situation where the big Norwegian is expressing a negative opinion about Ward's accent, which is an observation. However, the hypothesis states that the big Norwegian found Ward's accent ""at all easy,"" which is a statement that contradicts the premise. The premise is more of an observation, while the hypothesis is a prediction or a conclusion based on that observation. The two are not related in a logical way, and the premise does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis."	130	
1760543856	1760543857	Premise: You really don't know anything about me, do you, despite all that wallowing in my mind? As it happens I don't think I'm the right person to lead humanity into the future no.  Hypothesis: she is the right person to lead humanity into the future  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This is a classic example of a self-referential paradox, also known as a ""self-referential fallacy."" The premise is a self-referential statement that creates an infinite loop of reasoning, where the conclusion is dependent on the premise.  In this case, the premise states that ""You really don't know anything about me, despite all that wallowing in your mind."" This statement is self-referential because it refers to the speaker themselves. The speaker is essentially saying that they don't know anything about the speaker, which is a characteristic of themselves. However, this creates a paradox because if the speaker is unaware of their own ignorance, then it's unlikely that they can be the right person to lead humanity into the future.  The hypothesis, ""she is the right person to lead humanity into the future,"" is a reasonable conclusion based on the premise. The premise implies that the speaker is aware of their own limitations and the potential flaws in their decision-making abilities. This self-awareness and humility are valuable qualities that can be beneficial for making informed decisions.  To break the paradox, one might argue that the premise is not entirely accurate. The speaker may not be aware of their own limitations, but they are aware of the potential flaws in their decision-making. This nuance acknowledges that the speaker's self-awareness is a strength, rather than a weakness.  In this case, the hypothesis is still plausible, but it requires a more nuanced understanding of the speaker's self-awareness and its implications. A more convincing hypothesis might be: ""She is a highly intelligent and experienced leader who is aware of the potential risks and challenges of leading humanity into the future, and is therefore the right person to do so."" This revised hypothesis acknowledges the speaker's self-awareness without creating an infinite loop of reasoning."	368	
1760543857	1760543858	Premise: It's where the bands practise. I can't remember what band Petra's in, but I seen them practise once. They were OK but I didn't think they was brilliant.  Hypothesis: Petra's band was brilliant  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise entails the hypothesis because it sets up a causal relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise describes a situation where the person has seen Petra's band practice, which suggests that they were familiar with the band. The hypothesis, ""Petra's band is brilliant,"" is a conclusion based on that premise, assuming the person was indeed familiar with the band. The premise provides a basis for the hypothesis, indicating that the person's perception of the band's performance was likely positive."	98	
1760543858	1760543858	Premise: She swallowed hard, unsure if she had the nerve to go ahead. The memory of the pain in Tara's eyes last night decided her. Did he really expect her to believe that Tara was only the housekeeper?  Hypothesis: Tara was only the housekeeper  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise is a pivotal moment in the story, and the hypothesis is a reasonable one. Here's why:  The premise is a dramatic and emotional moment where Tara is faced with the possibility of not being believed by someone she trusts. She's about to share a painful memory with someone she cares about, and her fear of being rejected or dismissed is palpable. The fact that she's considering whether to share the memory suggests that she values honesty and trust.  The hypothesis, ""Tara was only the housekeeper,"" is a plausible explanation for why Tara would be hesitant to share the memory. It's possible that Tara has grown close to the person she's sharing the memory with, and she's concerned that they might not believe her or might be hurt by the truth.  The choice of the premise as a hypothesis is also interesting because it raises questions about Tara's character and her motivations. Is she being truthful, or is she trying to protect someone or herself? Does she genuinely believe the person she's sharing the memory with is someone she can trust, or is she hiding something? These questions are left unanswered, leaving the reader with more questions and a sense of intrigue.  Overall, the premise sets the stage for a dramatic and potentially suspenseful story, and the hypothesis adds depth and complexity to the narrative."	266	
1760543858	1760543860	Premise: If there are spirits at work at the time, they come only from yourself, not from the fume of the incense. Why should spirits aid living beings? What arrogance is it that drives people to believe they can have power over them?  Hypothesis: people can have power over spirits  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise suggests that spirits can aid living beings and that people can have power over them, which seems to imply a form of supernatural or spiritual interaction. The statement ""they come only from yourself, not from the fume of the incense"" implies that the spirits' actions are driven by personal intent or consciousness, rather than external factors such as incense or external forces.  This premise is consistent with several lines of reasoning:  1. **Self-awareness and intentionality**: The phrase ""they come only from yourself"" suggests that the spirits are not external forces, but rather the result of the person's own thoughts, emotions, and intentions. This aligns with the idea that consciousness and self-awareness are essential for the existence of spirits. 2. **Personal responsibility**: The statement implies that people have agency and control over the spirits, which is a fundamental aspect of human self-awareness and the concept of personal responsibility. 3. **Emphasis on the individual's consciousness**: The phrase ""not from the fume of the incense"" suggests that the spirits are not external forces, but rather a manifestation of the individual's inner workings. This emphasizes the importance of the individual's consciousness and the role of self-awareness in shaping their interactions with the world. 4. **Spiritual or supernatural aspects**: The use of the word ""spirits"" implies a more spiritual or supernatural context, which is a common trope in many cultures and belief systems.  However, the premise may not entail the hypothesis in several ways:  1. **Lack of empirical evidence**: There is no empirical evidence to support the existence of spirits or the idea that they can aid living beings. The premise is a philosophical and metaphysical concept, rather than a scientific hypothesis. 2. **Lack of clear definition of ""power""**: The premise does not define what ""power"" means, which is a crucial aspect of the hypothesis. If the premise implies that people can have power over spirits, it is unclear what kind of power or influence this would entail. 3. **Potential for misuse**: The premise could be used to justify or rationalize abusive or coercive behavior, which is not in line with the spirit of the hypothesis."	455	
1760543860	1760543862	Premise: Why should this topic matter? You talked about everything else as you usually do. Why should I feel Maelmuire is important?  Hypothesis: Maelmuire is important  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This time, I'll provide a response that addresses the topic in a more nuanced and insightful way.  Maelmuire, a character from the classic fantasy novel ""The Mists of Avalon"" by Marion Zimmer Bradley, is a fascinating figure that warrants consideration. While the premise of the novel explores themes of feminine power, spirituality, and the struggle between good and evil, Maelmuire's importance extends far beyond the realm of literature. Here's why:  1. **Feminist icon**: Maelmuire's story challenges traditional patriarchal norms and expectations of femininity. As a powerful and independent character, she embodies the complexities and strengths of women in a world dominated by men. Her character encourages readers to question the societal norms and expectations placed upon women, making her a powerful symbol of female empowerment. 2. **Cultural significance**: Maelmuire's story intersects with the historical context of the 5th century BCE, when the Mabinogion, a collection of Welsh folk tales, was written. Her character and narrative have been influential in shaping the cultural heritage of Wales and Scotland, making her a connection to the region's rich cultural heritage. 3. **Influence on feminist thought**: Maelmuire's character has been interpreted as a symbol of the feminine principle, embodying qualities such as receptivity, nurturing, and wisdom. Her story has inspired feminist thinkers, such as feminist scholar and writer, Margery Price, who saw Maelmuire as a representation of the feminine in a patriarchal society. 4. **Literary significance**: As a character in a literary work, Maelmuire has contributed to the canon of literature, influencing the way we think about women, power, and relationships in stories. Her character has been analyzed and interpreted in various literary critiques, demonstrating the impact of her story on literary theory and criticism. 5. **Symbolism and metaphor**: Maelmuire's character can be seen as a metaphor for various aspects of life, such as the struggle between light and darkness, order and chaos, or the balance between reason and intuition. Her story can be interpreted as a reflection of the human condition, encouraging readers to question and reflect on their own values and priorities.  In conclusion, Maelmuire's importance lies in her complex and multifaceted nature, which transcends the realm of literature. Her influence on feminist thought, cultural heritage, literary canon, and symbolic meaning make her a significant figure that warrants consideration."	510	
1760543862	1760543864	Premise: It is all very well, in these changing times, to adapt one's work to take in duties not traditionally within one's realm. But bantering is of another dimension altogether. For one thing how would one know for sure that at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected?  Hypothesis: at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise that a response of the bantering sort is always what is expected at any given moment is a challenging hypothesis. Let's analyze the situation.  On one hand, in most social interactions, people tend to expect responses that are playful, witty, and engaging, often with a sense of mutual banter or repartee. This is because banter is a fundamental aspect of human communication, allowing us to build rapport, establish common ground, and create a sense of connection with others. However, this expectation is not absolute, and there are situations where a response of banter might not be what is expected.  There are several reasons why a response of banter might not be what is expected:  1. **Emotional tone**: Banter can sometimes be perceived as aggressive, confrontational, or even hurtful, especially if it's not delivered with the right tone or intent. In these cases, the response might not be what is expected, and the other person might not realize they've been hit with a jab. 2. **Context**: The context of the conversation can influence how a response is perceived. For example, in a formal or professional setting, a lighthearted or playful banter might not be suitable, and a response that's too sarcastic or condescending might be perceived as unprofessional. 3. **Power dynamics**: In some situations, a response of banter can be used to assert dominance or manipulate others. In such cases, the expected response might not be what is expected, and the other person might not realize they've been taken advantage of. 4. **Personal boundaries**: People have different comfort levels with banter, and some might not enjoy being the target of playful teasing or jokes. In these cases, the response might not be what is expected, and the person being bantered might not realize they've been made to feel uncomfortable.  To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, let's consider a few scenarios:  * Imagine a conversation between two friends, where one person is trying to joke around and tease the other. In this case, the expected response is likely to be playful and lighthearted, not something that would be considered ""banter."" * However, if the conversation turns serious and one person starts to get defensive or hurt, the response might not be what is expected. In this case, the other person might not realize that the conversation has taken a turn and is not what they were expecting. * In a workplace setting, a response of banter might be expected in certain situations, such as a team-building exercise or a social gathering. However, in other situations, a more professional or serious tone might be expected, and a response of banter might not be what is expected.  In conclusion, the premise that a response of banter is always what is expected at any given moment is not necessarily true. There are many factors that can influence how a response is perceived, and people may not always respond in the way that is expected."	616	
1760543864	1760543865	Premise: But the horror of losing was as much to do with money as with pride. Biddy had never let them down, come without fail all through the bad weather, and now was giving Nails an intensive course on her own horse which - in terms of money - was worth another couple of hundred pounds. Yet surely she knew they had no way of paying should she demand it?  Hypothesis: they had no way of paying  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise and the hypothesis seem to be related, but not directly connected.  The premise sets up a situation where Biddy is faced with a difficult decision regarding her horse training course, which she is now giving herself. The premise states that she has ""never let them down"" and is concerned about losing the course, implying that the success of the course is tied to her reputation and pride.  The hypothesis, however, is ""they had no way of paying."" This statement is not directly related to the premise, which is focused on Biddy's personal feelings about the course. The hypothesis is a separate issue that is not necessarily connected to the premise.  A more accurate hypothesis might be ""Nails has no way of paying"" or ""the course is not financially viable."" This hypothesis is more closely tied to the premise, as it addresses the potential consequences of Biddy's actions (or lack thereof) and is related to the topic of the course.  Therefore, the premise does not directly entail the hypothesis."	206	
1760543865	1760543865	Premise: I ducked so fast I wasn't sure whether he 'd seen me or not, but it gave me a prickly feeling just to imagine it, so I scuttled for the door and legged it up the spiral stairway three steps at a time, just in case. As I ran, I remember thinking stupid thoughts like. How did he know I was up here looking down?  Hypothesis: he was up there looking down  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise suggests that the protagonist is trying to escape or avoid a confrontation, and their thought pattern is one of paranoia and self-preservation. They are worried that the person they saw was watching them, implying that they were somehow aware of their presence.  The hypothesis that the person ""was up there looking down"" seems to be a logical extension of this thought pattern. If the protagonist is trying to avoid a confrontation, they would logically assume that the person is watching them from above, which would explain their fear of being seen.  The premise sets up a situation where the protagonist is already in a vulnerable position (running for the door), and their thoughts are racing with worst-case scenarios (how did he know they were looking up?). The hypothesis provides a simple and logical explanation for these thoughts, making it a plausible scenario.  However, there's a slight twist in the premise - the protagonist is ducking and scuttling up the stairs, which suggests that they are trying to avoid confrontation, not necessarily because they are afraid of what they saw. It's possible that the protagonist is actually trying to avoid a confrontation with the person they saw, rather than just being paranoid about being seen."	240	
1760543865	1760543866	Premise: At the heart of the universe there is cruelty. We are predators and are preyed upon, every living thing. Did you know that wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds piercing the weak spot in their armour?  Hypothesis: wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""At the heart of the universe there is cruelty"" is an interesting philosophical statement, but it doesn't entail the hypothesis that wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds.  The premise is a poetic and thought-provoking statement that highlights the idea of the universe as a place of suffering and pain. It suggests that even the natural world is characterized by cruelty and predation.  However, the hypothesis that wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds is a specific scientific fact, not a philosophical statement about the universe as a whole. The two concepts are unrelated, and there is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis.  In other words, the premise is more of a rhetorical device to highlight the cruelty of the natural world, while the hypothesis is a factual statement about the biology of wasps and ladybirds.  A better hypothesis might be: ""Wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds because it is a natural and effective way to ensure the survival of their species."" This revised hypothesis is more of a scientific explanation for why wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds, rather than a philosophical statement about the universe as a whole.  It's worth noting that the premise is often used in the context of existentialist philosophy, particularly in the work of Albert Camus, to highlight the absurdity and cruelty of human existence. However, in a purely scientific context, the premise is not related to the hypothesis."	288	
1760543866	1760543867	Premise: ``I wanted to tell you. But the Bookman asked me to keep our meeting a secret.'' How did you know I 'd met him?  Hypothesis: he had met the Bookman  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	I would argue that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states that the narrator wanted to tell the Bookman about the meeting, but was asked to keep it a secret. This implies that the narrator had already communicated the information to the Bookman, but the Bookman is not explicitly stated to have been the one who initiated the conversation or to have met the narrator.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, simply states that the narrator had met the Bookman, without any indication that the narrator wanted to share this information with the Bookman. The premise is more focused on the act of sharing the information, rather than the motivation behind it.  Therefore, the premise does not logically entail the hypothesis, as the hypothesis is not directly related to the initial motivation (i.e., the narrator wanting to share the information).	173	
1760543867	1760543868	Premise: She rubbed them away with an angry fist. She was a fool to let anyone get round her. How long before she learned that folk 'll always take advantage of weakness?  Hypothesis: folk 'll always take advantage of weakness  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""She rubbed them away with an angry fist"" and the hypothesis ""folk 'll always take advantage of weakness"" do not necessarily entail each other.  The premise is stating that someone has had a negative experience with someone who took advantage of them, and it's implying that this person will do the same to others in the future. However, it doesn't provide any information about the other person's actions or intentions.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, is stating that people will always take advantage of those who are weak or vulnerable. This is a general statement about human nature, but it doesn't necessarily imply that the premise is true. It's possible for someone to be strong and resilient and not be a victim of exploitation.  To make a stronger connection between the premise and the hypothesis, you might need to add more context or information about the person who took advantage of the initial situation. For example:  ""She rubbed them away with an angry fist, and now she's learned that she's a fool to let anyone get close to her, and she's been cautious ever since.""  In this revised version, the premise implies that the person was taken advantage of, and the hypothesis is a general statement about people's behavior towards others in vulnerable situations."	258	
1760543868	1760543869	Premise: At length she decided that there was nothing to be gained by worrying her. Probably there was some quite innocent explanation, which Roger Kenyon would give her when she returned the wallet - if, indeed, it were his. And yet why had his manner changed so abruptly when he learned that the girl whose hat he had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage?  Hypothesis: the girl whose hat Roger Kenyon had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""At length she decided that there was nothing to be gained by worrying her"" is not supported by the information given in the passage. This sentence implies that the girl was not worried or concerned about her situation, which is not mentioned or implied in the rest of the passage. The fact that she has just had her wallet stolen and is now at Sunset Cottage suggests that she is in a vulnerable or precarious situation, which would likely cause her to be worried.   The premise ""probably there was some quite innocent explanation"" also does not add any new information to the situation. It is not clear what this ""innocent explanation"" might be, and it does not necessarily suggest that the girl's situation is innocent.   Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis that the girl whose hat Roger Kenyon had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage. The hypothesis is not supported by the information provided in the passage."	187	
1760543869	1760543870	Premise: Anna looked at Peter again and said to herself in a guilty whisper, ``Will he become even more difficult?'' She wondered if a stranger could tell that he was difficult, just by looking at him. Would such a person watching Peter now reading the prayers of Rite B in his level pleasant voice notice that resentment lay like his blood just under his skin because the life he had chosen had not turned out as he had expected it to?  Hypothesis: resentment lay just under Peter's skin  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	This premise and hypothesis appear to be related, but they are not directly equivalent. Here's why:  The premise describes Anna's inner monologue, where she wonders if she can gauge Peter's level of difficulty in a non-verbal way by observing his behavior. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a specific prediction about how a stranger might notice Peter's level of difficulty.  In the premise, the focus is on Anna's internal state and her self-perception, while in the hypothesis, we are being asked to consider how a stranger might perceive Peter. The premise does not directly imply that the stranger would notice Peter's level of difficulty, but rather that they might be able to sense it through their observations.  However, if we were to consider the premise as a prediction about Peter's behavior, it could be argued that the hypothesis is actually supported. The premise describes Peter's internal state, and a stranger might indeed notice his difficulty in observing his level of difficulty through his behavior, such as his body language, tone of voice, or overall demeanor. So, the premise does imply that the hypothesis could be supported.  In this interpretation, the premise and hypothesis are equivalent, and the hypothesis is a specific prediction about how a stranger might perceive Peter's level of difficulty, which is what the premise describes.	266	
1760543870	1760543870	Premise: Jean was tough and liked to drink. She would endure for a long while yet. But what would she do when she realized that with things as they were she was on a life sentence not just a temporary suspension of essential pleasure?  Hypothesis: Jean was on a life sentence  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"I would argue that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states that Jean is ""tough"" and ""likes to drink,"" which suggests that she has a certain level of resilience and coping mechanism. However, it doesn't necessarily imply that she would be able to endure a life sentence. In fact, the premise seems to suggest that she would be able to withstand or even enjoy her situation, which is not a characteristic typically associated with someone facing a life sentence.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Jean is ""on a life sentence,"" which implies that she is facing a permanent and irreversible punishment. This is a much more severe consequence than what the premise describes.  Furthermore, the premise doesn't provide any information about Jean's personality or character traits that would suggest she would be able to endure a life sentence or find ways to cope with it. The premise is more of a statement about her behavior or attitude, rather than a prediction about her character.  Therefore, the premise does not logically entail the hypothesis, and the hypothesis is a more accurate representation of the situation."	227	
1760543870	1760543871	Premise: ``Clever''. Klug means ``clever''. Would you say that Abie was clever?  Hypothesis: Abie was clever  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""Abie was clever"" does not entail the hypothesis ""Abie was clever.""   The premise simply states a statement about Abie, which is not sufficient to determine whether Abie was indeed clever or not. The hypothesis ""Abie was clever"" is a conclusion that requires additional information or evidence to be supported."	67	
1760543871	1760543871	Premise: The Susweca. It means ``dragonfly'' in Sioux, you know. Did I ever tell you that's where Paul and I met?  Hypothesis: Susweca is where she and Paul met  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""The Susweca"" refers to the Sioux word for ""dragonfly,"" while the hypothesis ""Paul and I met there"" is an inference made by the speaker.  The premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise is a label assigned to a specific location (""The Susweca""), while the hypothesis is a statement about the relationship between two individuals (""Paul and I met""). There is no logical connection between the two statements, and the premise does not provide any information that would support or contradict the hypothesis."	106	
1760543871	1760543872	Premise: How do you know? she was going to ask, but his smile was answer enough. If DeVore said there was going to be a vacancy there would be a vacancy.  Hypothesis: there was going to be a vacancy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""she was going to ask, but his smile was answer enough"" can be translated to ""DeVore said there was going to be a vacancy, so there was going to be a vacancy"" or ""if there was going to be a vacancy, there was going to be a vacancy.""  This premise is not necessarily a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but rather a conditional statement that suggests a necessary condition for something to happen. The hypothesis, ""there was going to be a vacancy,"" is the antecedent, while the premise is the consequent.  In a conditional statement, if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true. In this case, the antecedent is ""DeVore said there was going to be a vacancy,"" and the consequent is ""there was going to be a vacancy."" Therefore, the premise is a necessary condition for the hypothesis, meaning that if DeVore's statement is true, then the hypothesis must also be true."	205	
1760543872	1760543872	Premise: She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked. Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit, then came out and was not very successful in finding a job to suit him. That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them.  Hypothesis: it was Edward's fault  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise suggests that the speaker believes that the decision to marry Edward was made without sufficient thought, implying that Edward is at fault for not being able to find a job. This creates a causal link between the premise and the hypothesis.  My choice of hypothesis: ""it was Edward's fault"" is correct. The premise establishes that Edward was not successful in finding a job, which is the cause of the speaker's concerns. The speaker implies that Edward's lack of success is the reason for their sister Louise's question, and therefore, the speaker believes that Edward is responsible for the decision to marry.  The speaker's tone and language suggest a sense of disappointment and frustration with Edward's lack of success, which reinforces the hypothesis that he is at fault. The phrase ""if anyone says that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them"" further emphasizes that the speaker is placing blame on Edward, making the hypothesis a logical conclusion based on the given premise."	196
