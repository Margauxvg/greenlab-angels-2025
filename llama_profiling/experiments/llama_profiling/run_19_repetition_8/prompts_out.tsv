1760618180	1760618180	Premise: It was a complex language. Not written down but handed down. One might say it was peeled down.  Hypothesis: the language was peeled down  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise ""It was a complex language. Not written down but handed down. One might say it was peeled down"" can be interpreted as a metaphorical expression meaning that the language was obscure or unintelligible, but the action of peeling it down implies a process of revealing or exposing the underlying simplicity or essence of the language.  Given this interpretation, the hypothesis that the language was peeled down seems to be supported. The phrase ""peeled down"" is an idiom that suggests a removal or stripping away of complexities, which aligns with the idea of stripping away layers to reveal the underlying simplicity of the language.  Therefore, the premise provides a plausible explanation for the hypothesis, making it a coherent and logical connection between the two concepts."	151	
1760618180	1760618180	Premise: It is part of their religion, a religion I do not scoff at as it holds many elements which match our own even though it lacks the truth of ours. At one of their great festivals they have the ritual of driving out the devils from their bodies. First the drummers come on - I may say that no women are allowed to take part in this ritual and the ladies here will perhaps agree with me that they are fortunate in that omission.  Hypothesis: no women are allowed to take part in this ritual  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that the ritual involves the drummers and that women are not allowed to participate. However, it does not explicitly state that women are excluded from the ritual as a group. It only mentions that ""the ladies"" (plural) agree that women are fortunate in this omission, implying that women are allowed to participate individually.  If the premise were to be extended to include the entire group, it would imply that the ritual excludes women as a group, which is not the case."	110	1.0
1760618180	1760618181	Premise: The Paris to Rouen railway was being extended to Le Havre, and the line cut straight through Dr Flaubert's land. Part of it was to be compulsorily purchased. You could say that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy.  Hypothesis: Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise states that Gustave's epilepsy led to his being shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset, suggesting a causal relationship between the two events. However, the hypothesis should be ""if"" followed by a clear explanation or condition that leads to the relationship between Gustave's epilepsy and his retreat.  The premise doesn't explicitly state that Gustave's epilepsy was the cause of his retreat, but rather that it was the condition that led to the shepherding. This makes the hypothesis ""if"" incomplete.   A corrected hypothesis should be ""if Gustave's epilepsy was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset, then"" to establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship."	139	
1760618181	1760618181	Premise: Part of it was to be compulsorily purchased. You could say that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy. You could also say he was driven there by the railway.  Hypothesis: Gustave was driven to creative retreat in Croisset by the railway  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	This premise states that Gustave was driven to creative retreat by the railway, but it does not directly entail the hypothesis.  The premise provides information about Gustave's situation, but it does not provide any information about the hypothesis. The hypothesis is the proposed explanation for Gustave's situation, which is that he was driven to the creative retreat by the railway.   To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to be modified to include information that directly supports the hypothesis. For example, if the premise states that Gustave was forced to take a train to the retreat, it could then be inferred that the railway was the driving force behind his trip.	131	
1760618181	1760618182	Premise: Some of them, like for instance the farm in Connecticut, are quite small. If I like a place I buy it. I guess you could say it's a hobby.  Hypothesis: buying places is a hobby  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""Some of them, like for instance the farm in Connecticut, are quite small"" seems to suggest that the purchase of a place is a hobby. However, upon closer examination, this premise doesn't necessarily entail the hypothesis.  The hypothesis is ""buying places is a hobby."" To test this hypothesis, we would need to establish a causal relationship between the act of buying a place and the act of engaging in the hobby.   In other words, we would need evidence that buying a place directly leads to an interest or enjoyment in the hobby, such as visiting the farm in Connecticut.  The premise only suggests that buying a place is related to the hobby, but it doesn't specify that buying a place is a necessary condition for engaging in the hobby. There could be many other reasons why someone buys a place, such as financial necessity, investment, or personal preference, and still enjoy the hobby.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	195	
1760618182	1760618183	Premise: Look, my dear, I'm not in my dotage yet, and I know I'm a grumbler and a complainer. You could say the only form of comfort I 've got are my complaints.  Hypothesis: the only form of comfort he has are his complaints  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"What a delightfully philosophical question!  Upon analyzing the premise and the hypothesis, I'd argue that the premise is not necessarily the hypothesis.  The premise states that the narrator is ""not in my dotage yet,"" which suggests that they are still relatively young and relatively healthy. This implies that they have a certain level of energy, vitality, and possibly even a positive outlook on life.  However, the hypothesis is ""the only form of comfort he [the narrator] has are his complaints."" This statement suggests that the narrator believes that their only source of comfort is complaining, which contradicts the premise. If the narrator is still relatively young and healthy, it's unlikely that they would have only one source of comfort, which is complaining.  A more plausible hypothesis would be that the narrator is actually someone who is in their prime, or at least has a high level of energy and positivity, and is using complaining as a coping mechanism or a way to deal with stress or frustration.  So, while the premise sets a interesting tone for the conversation, it doesn't necessarily entail the hypothesis."	221	
1760618183	1760618183	Premise: Then the silence in the Zoo became complete. Woil stared around him and then suddenly with a push of his wings raised himself into the air, turned, and landed ten feet away on the back of a green bench. Creggan could see that he was afraid and that his fear was making him terribly uncertain.  Hypothesis: Woil was afraid  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise and hypothesis do not directly entail each other.   The premise sets the scene for the story and introduces a character, Woil, who is shown to be in a state of fear and uncertainty. It sets up the situation, but it does not provide any information about Woil's emotions or thoughts, which is what the hypothesis is based on.  The hypothesis, ""Woil was afraid"", is a conclusion that can be drawn from the premise, but it is not a direct inference from the text. The text only tells us about Woil's physical state (being afraid and uncertain), but does not explicitly state his thoughts or feelings.  Therefore, the premise does not directly entail the hypothesis."	143	
1760618183	1760618184	Premise: But, of course, that just wasn't possible. Her disappointment over Jonathan, which had driven her to France in the first place, had been relegated somewhere to the back of her mind. Now in retrospect she could see that marriage to him would have been a ghastly mistake and that her reaction to discovering that he had been seeing other women while he had been engaged to her had had far more to do with wounded pride than with a wounded heart.  Hypothesis: marriage to Jonathan would have been a ghastly mistake  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""But, of course, that just wasn't possible"" suggests that the speaker had already accepted the reality of the situation, which implies that she had already made up her mind about Jonathan.   The subsequent statement ""Now in retrospect she could see that marriage to him would have been a ghastly mistake"" indicates that she had already made up her mind about Jonathan, which is contrary to the premise.  So, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise sets the context for the hypothesis, but it does not establish the hypothesis itself."	113	
1760618184	1760618185	Premise: Like now. The Community in Knockglen would defend Eve vociferously. Even some of the Sisters here in Dublin might see that the girl had a point.  Hypothesis: the girl had a point  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise sets up a situation where Eve is defending a character, and some of the Sisters in Dublin might see her point. The premise could be interpreted in a few ways, but the hypothesis (the girl had a point) seems to be related to the action of the character defending her.  My choice is to say that the premise entails the hypothesis because it sets up a situation where Eve is in a defensive position, which could be seen as a form of justification or explanation for her actions. In this context, the premise suggests that Eve is trying to justify her actions or behavior, which could be related to the hypothesis.  The phrase ""the girl had a point"" implies that Eve is trying to make a case for her actions, which is a common way to defend oneself or an argument. This could be seen as a way to justify or explain one's behavior, which is what the hypothesis suggests.  However, it's worth noting that the premise could also be interpreted in other ways, such as:  * Eve might be defending herself or someone else, rather than the girl. * The girl's point might not be about Eve's actions, but rather about something else entirely. * The premise might not be directly related to the hypothesis, and the relationship between them is not clear.  To make a more definitive statement, more context or additional information would be needed to clarify the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis."	288	
1760618185	1760618185	Premise: ``They have to be crushed, Bobkins!'' So saying, she marched off down the gravel path, making the kind of crunching noise Robert had thought could only be produced by the BBC sound-effects department. As they rounded the edge of the building he could see that behind the house was a vast garden.  Hypothesis: behind the house was a vast garden  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""They have to be crushed, Bobkins!"" is an exclamation of frustration or exasperation, likely due to some unseen obstacle or challenge.   The hypothesis ""behind the house was a vast garden"" is a statement of fact. It is a statement that is supported by the premise, as the speaker says ""So saying, she marched off down the gravel path, making the kind of crunching noise Robert had thought could only be produced by the BBC sound-effects department"". This implies that the speaker is suggesting that the sound of crunching is a sound typically made by the BBC, and that it is in fact coming from behind the house."	134	
1760618185	1760618186	Premise: ``Do you mind if I use your phone?'' Ronni could see that Guido's brain was whirring.  Hypothesis: Guido's brain was whirring  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise ""Do you mind if I use your phone?"" does not entail the hypothesis ""Guido's brain was whirring"".  The premise is a simple question that asks if someone is willing to give permission to use someone else's phone, which is a specific action. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a more general statement about Guido's brain, which is a part of his body. The premise does not provide any information about Guido's brain, so it does not establish a direct causal relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	123	
1760618186	1760618186	Premise: ``Look, lady, give me a break. I just deliver the stuff, I don't interview it for the Sunday papers.'' He waved the paper at her and even at a distance she could see that it said very little.  Hypothesis: the paper said very little  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise ""He waved the paper at her and even at a distance she could see that it said very little"" is a statement about the physical appearance of the paper, specifically that it is vague or uninteresting. However, this statement does not necessarily imply that the paper actually said very little. The paper could be a very interesting and informative article, but its content is simply not noticeable or relevant to the conversation.  In other words, the premise is a matter of appearance, not reality. The paper could be a fascinating piece of journalism, but its content is not presented in a way that would make it noticeable or impactful. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a statement about the content of the paper, which is that it said very little.  The connection between the premise and the hypothesis is a logical one, but it's a weak one. The hypothesis is a prediction about the content of the paper, whereas the premise is a statement about the appearance of the paper."	210	
1760618186	1760618187	Premise: ``You 've heard something like that before. Haven't you, Jimmy?'' Jimmy had been shaken by those sounds more shaken than the others for good reason but Cardiff could see that he was unprepared to show it as he pushed himself away from the reception counter.  Hypothesis: Jimmy was unprepared to show he had been shaken  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise sets up a situation where Jimmy is reacting to a specific event (""You've heard something like that before. Haven't you, Jimmy?""), and the expected response from Jimmy would be to acknowledge that he has heard something similar before. However, the premise does not establish that Jimmy is indeed shaken by the event or that he is unprepared to show it.   The hypothesis, on the other hand, assumes that Jimmy is shaken by the event and unprepared to show it, but the premise does not provide sufficient information to support this conclusion. The premise only sets up the situation, but does not state that Jimmy is shaken or unprepared to show it."	145	
1760618187	1760618188	Premise: It was Alan's idea. He made a sour kind of joke out of it, that they must wait until their wedding night. Carolyn agreed because she could see he meant it although she didn't understand why.  Hypothesis: Alan meant it  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Based on the premise, it seems that Alan's intention behind the joke was to make Carolyn laugh and have sex on their wedding night. However, the premise itself does not explicitly state that Alan meant to say this. The phrase ""sour kind of joke"" is a vague and ambiguous expression that could be interpreted in multiple ways.  In this case, Carolyn's agreement to wait until their wedding night could be a sign that she is indeed aware of Alan's intentions, but it's not explicitly stated that he meant to have sex on their wedding night. Instead, it's possible that Carolyn is just humorously agreeing to humor Alan out of politeness or to avoid hurting his feelings.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis that Alan meant to have sex on their wedding night. The hypothesis requires a more explicit statement or action that confirms Alan's intention, which is not present in the premise."	182	
1760618188	1760618188	Premise: And why bother to write anyway? What was there to say? Mary had some vague idea that Adam's parents might suspect he was down here and come to see him.  Hypothesis: Adam was down here  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise sets up a situation where Mary thinks Adam might have come to see her, but it doesn't provide any information about Adam's intentions or actions. The hypothesis, ""Adam was down here,"" is an assumption that is not supported by the given information. The premise only suggests that Mary might have some reason to believe Adam is there, but it doesn't reveal whether he is indeed there or not.  To make the premise entail the hypothesis, we would need to add more information that directly supports the hypothesis, such as Adam's actions or words, which are not provided in the given text."	130	
1760618188	1760618188	Premise: ``And you're not having this dress,'' Nora said, bending down to look at the price tag. ``It's two and a half guineas!'' she hissed at Louise who could tell that she was genuinely appalled.  Hypothesis: Nora was genuinely appalled  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Nora is ""genuinely appalled"" which is a subjective emotional state, whereas the hypothesis is a statement that Nora is not having the dress. The two statements are not related in a causal relationship, and there is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis.  In other words, the premise sets up a situation where Nora is reacting negatively to something, but the hypothesis simply states that Nora is not having the dress, without any underlying cause or relationship to the premise."	112	
1760618188	1760618189	Premise: She said good morning to Alice and Alice said hallo. She was thin and rather tall with a very lined gentle face and hair that was white but which Alice could see had once been blonde. She could also have told this was Tina's mother before Mrs Darne went off down the passage that led to the Headmaster's Flat.  Hypothesis: this was Tina's mother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	This premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise describes a scenario where a woman is introduced as being thin and tall with a very lined face, and blonde hair, which is a distinctive characteristic of Tina's mother. However, the premise does not provide any information about the woman's age, occupation, or any other personal details that would support the hypothesis that the woman is Tina's mother.  In order for the hypothesis to be supported, the premise would need to provide additional information that links the woman in the scene to Tina. For example, the woman might have a distinctive tattoo or a certain object that Tina recognizes as belonging to her mother. Without this additional information, the premise only provides a general description of the woman, and it is not clear whether it is Tina's mother.	159	
1760618189	1760618189	Premise: She might have sat all afternoon, nibbling and stuporous, exhausted but not sleepy. But the glazier finally came down from the upper floor, cheerfully announcing that all was now right and tight and he would be on his way. Maggie could tell that he would have liked to stop for a chat that he felt sorry for her left on her own but she lacked either her grandmother's grace or her mother's energy so she did not offer him tea.  Hypothesis: the glazier would have liked to stop for a chat  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise establishes that the glazier is sitting, not talking to someone, and that he is coming down from the upper floor. The phrase ""all is now right and tight"" implies that the glazier is fixing something, but the rest of the passage does not support this interpretation.   The glazier's cheerful announcement suggests that he is exiting the scene, but the text does not provide any information about what he is fixing. Therefore, the premise does not establish a causal relationship between the glazier's actions and the glazier's decision to stop for a chat. The hypothesis that the glazier would like to stop for a chat is not supported by the text."	152	1.0
1760618189	1760618190	Premise: Jim waited. He waited a long time, and when the young doctor finally came out, it was almost dark. Jim could nonetheless tell by his anxious face that something was wrong.  Hypothesis: something was wrong  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise states that Jim ""waited"" for a long time, but it does not provide any information about what he was waiting for. The fact that the young doctor came out and that it was almost dark is simply a neutral piece of information that does not necessarily imply that something was wrong.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a statement that is implied by the premise, but not explicitly stated. The premise sets up a situation where Jim is waiting, which suggests that something is wrong, but it does not directly state what that something is. The hypothesis is a conclusion that is drawn from the premise, but it is not explicitly stated."	140	
1760618190	1760618191	Premise: ``Yes?'' ``Nathan?'' He could tell it was long-distance the line was so gravelly and hollow but he didn't recognise the voice.  Hypothesis: the call was long-distance  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""Yes? 'Nathan?'"" suggests a situation where Nathan is calling from a distance, likely a long distance away. However, the tone of the voice is described as ""gravelly and hollow"", which implies that Nathan is speaking in a somewhat monotone or unenthusiastic manner.  Given the combination of the premise and the hypothesis, it is likely that the call is indeed long-distance. Here's why:  *   The ""gravelly and hollow"" tone of Nathan's voice contradicts the expected enthusiastic and upbeat tone associated with a long-distance call. *   The fact that Nathan's voice is described as ""hollow"" suggests that he is speaking in a way that is more like a monotone or monotone-like voice, which is often characteristic of long-distance calls. *   The fact that the voice is described as ""hollow"" and ""gravelly"" also suggests that Nathan is not speaking with a lot of emotional intensity or passion, which is also consistent with a long-distance call."	212	
1760618191	1760618191	Premise: Chopra stood unsteadily on his feet. The shapechanger bounded around with excitement. Chopra could tell something had happened.  Hypothesis: something had happened  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Chopra ""stood unsteadily on his feet"", which implies that he is unsteady or unstable. This sets up a scenario where he is in a precarious position, but it doesn't necessarily mean that something has happened to him.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, is that something has happened. To be a hypothesis, it needs to be a specific event or situation that could potentially explain the premise. The premise only provides a general description of Chopra's state (standing unsteadily), without specifying what happened.  For the hypothesis to be true, it would need additional information or context that links the unsteadiness to a specific event or situation."	150	
1760618191	1760618192	Premise: It seemed impossible that anyone could endure such pain for so long, but at last the doors of the Renault slammed and there was comparative silence. The engine was started up, revving violently as the car was turned round on the narrow road. John could tell that it was being driven back up the hill towards Putna.  Hypothesis: the car was being driven back up the hill towards Putna  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""It seemed impossible that anyone could endure such pain for so long"" and the hypothesis ""the car was being driven back up the hill towards Putna"" do not logically entail each other.  The premise sets up a situation where John is describing an experience (the pain of enduring for so long), while the hypothesis is a statement about the car's behavior (the car is being driven back up the hill). These two statements are related to different aspects of the situation and do not have a direct causal relationship.  In other words, the premise describes a subjective experience (John's perception of pain), while the hypothesis is a factual statement (the car is being driven). The two statements are not logically connected, and therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	156	
1760618192	1760618193	Premise: Just when you think you 've got it straight, along comes the Fool with his pig's bladder and whops you on the nose. By the way, I'm no idiot. I could tell Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see me at the airport.  Hypothesis: Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see her at the airport  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""Just when you think you've got it straight, along comes the Fool with his pig's bladder and whops you on the nose"" is a play on the traditional character from A Midsummer Night's Dream, where the character Bottom is a donkey (Fool) who is pranked by the mischievous Puck and whipped on the nose by Oberon. The phrase ""whops you on the nose"" is an idiom that means to slap or hit someone on the nose.  In this context, the premise implies that the speaker is aware of a joke or a prank being played on them, and they're anticipating that Gillian and Stuart, who are familiar with the joke, will react negatively to the speaker's presence at the airport. The speaker is saying that they thought they had gotten it ""straight,"" implying that they had anticipated the joke, but the surprise twist comes when they realize that their friends are not amused.  The hypothesis ""Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see her at the airport"" is supported by the premise. The speaker's statement implies that they thought they had gotten a positive response from their friends, but the twist suggests that they were actually rejected or unimpressed. The phrase ""I could tell Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see me"" suggests that the speaker expected a positive reaction, and the humor in the premise comes from the unexpected reversal of that expectation."	290	
1760618193	1760618194	Premise: He's weird enough to have undressed me without thinking, according to some mad notion of the ``proper'' thing to do. Perhaps he thought I couldn't lie in bed with my clothes on.  Hypothesis: she couldn't lie in bed with her clothes on  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise and hypothesis are related but not identical.  The premise states that ""He's weird enough to have undressed me without thinking,"" which implies a situation where someone has taken an unusual action (undressing the speaker) without considering the speaker's discomfort or consent. This action is presented as a weird or unusual behavior, suggesting that the speaker might have felt uncomfortable or betrayed.  The hypothesis, ""she couldn't lie in bed with her clothes on,"" is a statement about a person (the woman) who supposedly has a certain characteristic (being able to lie in bed with her clothes on). The hypothesis is trying to make a generalization about a person based on a specific situation.  However, upon closer examination, it's unlikely that the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise is more of a descriptive statement about a specific action, while the hypothesis is a statement about a characteristic or behavior. The two are not logically connected.   A more plausible interpretation would be that the premise is describing a situation where the speaker is trying to make a point about the nature of the speaker's relationship with the person (he), and the hypothesis is an attempt to generalize that characteristic to a broader context or a person in general."	245	
1760618194	1760618194	Premise: That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort. Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all. But you will perhaps understand that there was a natural tendency on my part in asking what was after all a generous favour from my employer to hint that there was a good professional motive behind my request.  Hypothesis: there was a natural tendency on her part to hint that there was a good professional motive behind her request  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Mr. Farraday enjoys a lighthearted, humorous tone and is likely to talk in a bantering manner at that time of day. This implies that he is not a serious or formal person, but rather someone who enjoys casual conversations and can be playful.  However, the hypothesis is a statement about Miss Kenton's reaction to the request, not a statement about Mr. Farraday's behavior or personality. The hypothesis suggests that Miss Kenton would have been likely to hint that there was a good professional motive behind Mr. Farraday's request, but the premise does not provide any information about Miss Kenton's reaction to the request, only Mr. Farraday's.  Therefore, the premise does not logically lead to the hypothesis, which is a conclusion that can be drawn from Mr. Farraday's behavior and personality.	185	
1760618194	1760618195	Premise: But don't dilly-dally for too long. Once it's published we are all going to look a little risible if we have made no adjustments to what is after all known as being predominantly my own design of gallery. Also I am a bit older than the rest of you but you can perhaps understand that I don't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation.  Hypothesis: he doesn't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise and the hypothesis are related but not identical.  The premise states that the artist is worried about being ridiculed or ostracized if their work is not widely recognized or understood, implying that their work is their original idea.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the artist is worried about dying without a public recantation of their work, implying that they want to publicly retract or apologize for their original creation.  The main difference is that the premise focuses on the artist's concerns about being ridiculed or ostracized, while the hypothesis focuses on the artist's desire for public recognition or validation. However, if we interpret the premise as implying that the artist's work is their original idea and that they are concerned about its recognition or understanding, then the hypothesis could be seen as a direct consequence of the premise.	170	
1760618195	1760618196	Premise: I should dearly have liked to know whether they were Europeans or Americans, but I couldn't hear the accents. They appeared to be arguing. I hoped the white men weren't telling him to eliminate all witnesses because I don't believe it would have needed much persuasion.  Hypothesis: eliminating all witnesses would have needed much persuasion  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise states that the white men were arguing and that the speaker hoped they were not trying to persuade the witnesses by eliminating them, but rather that they believed eliminating the witnesses was unnecessary. However, the premise does not provide any information about the nature of the arguments or the motivation behind the actions of the white men.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that eliminating all witnesses would have needed much persuasion. To entail the premise, the premise would need to be modified to include information that supports this hypothesis. For example:  Premise: I heard a group of white men arguing in a small village in Europe, and I suspected they were American expats who were discussing the recent treaty that was about to be signed.  In this revised premise, it can be inferred that the hypothesis is correct because eliminating all witnesses would indeed have been necessary to prevent any potential repercussions or repercussions from the treaty signing.  However, without the original premise, we can't be certain that the hypothesis is true.	210	
1760618196	1760618196	Premise: But the damage was done as far as my faith was concerned, which is probably why I went mad. So anyway, that Christmas Eve night confirmed my worst fears, it was like a kind of ``royal flush'' for the infant Jimbo. All three kings - Pa Santa and the King of Kings - all down the pan together... And to be honest I don't believe any of them stands a chance of ever making a comeback with me.  Hypothesis: any of the three kings stands a chance of ever making a comeback with him  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise of the story is that the narrator has a deep-seated faith in Santa Claus, but it has been shattered by a traumatic event. This event has left the narrator questioning their faith, and they now have a pessimistic outlook on the world.  The hypothesis ""any of the three kings stands a chance of ever making a comeback with him"" is a counterfactual statement. It suggests that the narrator believes that at least one of the three kings (Santa, Pa Santa, and the King of Kings) will eventually regain their faith or find a way to make amends with the narrator.  The premise sets up a clear cause-and-effect relationship between the narrator's faith and the possibility of the kings' comeback. However, the hypothesis itself is not necessarily supported by the given premise.  The narrator's faith was shattered by a traumatic event, but there is no indication that the event has anything to do with the kings' ability to regain their faith. The narrative doesn't suggest that the narrator's faith has been restored, or that they are seeking to convince the kings to make amends.  The premise only establishes the narrator's current state of mind and the traumatic event that led to it, without providing any information about the kings' potential future actions or outcomes. Therefore, the hypothesis is not necessarily supported by the given premise."	271	
1760618196	1760618197	Premise: He had seen something I should have, which was a car turning in from Soho Square and coming up behind me. My right foot hovered over the accelerator pedal and I balanced Armstrong on the clutch. I wasn't as convinced as Malpass that Nevil was out of harm's way.  Hypothesis: Nevil was out of harm's way  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise states: ""He had seen something I should have, which was a car turning in from Soho Square and coming up behind me."" This implies that there was a car that the narrator should have noticed, and that it was coming from Soho Square. However, the premise does not mention anything about Nevil being aware of the car's presence or the narrator's position.  The hypothesis, ""Nevil was out of harm's way,"" is a conditional statement that is not supported by the premise. The premise does not establish Nevil's knowledge or awareness of the car, and the word ""out of harm's way"" is a logical consequence that can be inferred from the premise but not explicitly stated.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, and the hypothesis is a separate statement that needs to be supported by additional evidence or information."	174	
1760618197	1760618198	Premise: Jed wondered. He 'd scarcely set eyes on him since the night they 'd had dinner together at the house in Westwood. Nobody had mentioned him either and Jed didn't feel he should ask.  Hypothesis: Jed should ask  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that Jed wondered about the person he hadn't seen since the dinner together at the house in Westwood, which implies that the person in question is the subject of his curiosity. The phrase ""since the night they 'd had dinner together"" also indicates that the person is the main focus of his thoughts.  Furthermore, the fact that nobody mentioned the person to Jed suggests that he didn't know they existed or had not been introduced to them, which further supports the idea that the person is the subject of his curiosity. Therefore, the premise sets the stage for the hypothesis that Jed should ask the person about their whereabouts."	137	
1760618198	1760618199	Premise: Yet what good came from knowing that a woman had killed herself? The children who had suffered a trauma would survive the experience, scarred by it and a little flawed by it. They would never forget that for a week they had imagined the act of murder had been committed.  Hypothesis: for a week the children had imagined the act of murder had been committed  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise entails the hypothesis because it sets up a scenario where a traumatic event (the woman's self-inflicted injury) has a profound impact on the children. Here's why:  1. **Empathy and emotional impact**: The fact that the children imagine the act of murder being committed to them suggests that the experience has a significant emotional impact on them. They are likely to have felt frightened, scared, and possibly traumatized by the experience. 2. **Long-term effects**: The fact that the children are ""scarred by it"" and ""a little flawed by it"" implies that the experience has had a lasting impact on their lives, affecting their emotional well-being and development. This is consistent with the idea that traumatic experiences can have long-term effects on mental health and emotional development. 3. **Memory and imagination**: The children's imagination of the act of murder implies that their minds are still processing and reinterpreting the event, even after a week. This suggests that the experience is still having a significant impact on their mental state, even if it's not immediately apparent.  However, it's worth noting that the premise doesn't necessarily entail the hypothesis. The hypothesis is more focused on the long-term effects of the traumatic event on the children's lives, whereas the premise only explores the immediate impact on the children's minds. If the premise were to be true, it would likely be a significant and lasting effect, but the hypothesis is more about the children's long-term emotional and psychological impact, which might not be directly related to the premise."	317	
1760618199	1760618199	Premise: Nora calculated that there must be lots of single men up there so she decided it was ideal for the ``manhunt'', as we called it, even though the train fare was a serious consideration. I remember we went up to Euston together one Saturday morning, very excited, to buy the ticket in advance. It was a secret - if my parents had known she was going away alone they would have soon put the kybosh on it.  Hypothesis: Nora was going away alone  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise (""Nora calculated that there must be lots of single men up there so she decided it was ideal for the 'manhunt', as we called it"") and the hypothesis (""Nora was going away alone"") do not entail each other.  A hypothesis is a statement that predicts a particular outcome based on a set of circumstances. In this case, the premise describes a situation where Nora is planning to go away alone, which is the hypothesis. However, the premise itself does not provide any information about Nora's actual intentions or motivations, so it does not necessarily predict that she will go away alone.  The premise is more of a setup or a motivation, while the hypothesis is the actual conclusion that is being drawn from that setup. Therefore, the premise and the hypothesis are not related in a causal relationship."	165	
1760618199	1760618200	Premise: His mother driving the car, so happy, young-looking and fashionably dressed and his father, a big, confident man in a smart suit, smiling and turning round to say something to Simon in the back seat. Marie thought of her own mother with her frumpy clothes and ageing, lined face. No one would have guessed that she was only forty-two.  Hypothesis: Marie's mother was only forty-two  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise sets up a clear contrast between Marie's mother and her father, with the mother being portrayed as young-looking and fashionable, while the father is described as big, confident, and in a smart suit. This creates an interesting dynamic where the mother's age and appearance are hinted to be different from her father's.  The choice of Marie's mother as forty-two is a strong hypothesis because:  1. **Contrast**: The description of the mother's appearance and behavior creates a clear contrast to her father's, which is a common trope in literature and media where the mother is often portrayed as the ""cool"" and the father as the ""old"" or ""frumpy"". 2. **Implied age**: The fact that Marie's mother is described as ""frumpy"" and "" ageing"" suggests that she might be older than her father, which is a common assumption in many stories where the mother is portrayed as the older sibling. 3. **Contrast in values**: The contrast between the mother's youthful appearance and the father's confidence suggests that the mother might be more ""cool"" and the father more ""old"", which is a common theme in many stories where the mother is seen as the ""cool"" and the father as the ""wise"" or ""inexperienced"".  However, it's worth noting that the premise does not explicitly state that the mother is forty-two, but rather that she is forty-two. This means that the hypothesis is not necessarily proven or disproven by the premise alone. The author could still choose to subvert this expectation and reveal that Marie's mother is actually younger than forty-two, which would create an interesting twist in the story."	343	
1760618200	1760618201	Premise: ``I hope you are settling down and the cat is well.'' This was a lie. She did not hope the cat was well.  Hypothesis: the cat was well  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""I hope you are settling down and the cat is well"" is a lie. The statement ""I hope"" is a future conditional, which implies that the speaker is expressing a desire for something to happen in the future. This is a strong indication that the speaker is not actually concerned with the cat's well-being at the moment, but rather is making a statement about their own life or circumstances.  The hypothesis ""the cat was well"" is a statement that contradicts the premise, suggesting that the cat is actually in poor health. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, and the speaker is not actually expressing confidence in the cat's well-being."	136	
1760618201	1760618202	Premise: Jane ate without pausing. Hunger was an unknown experience. She had never imagined it could actually hurt.  Hypothesis: hunger could actually hurt  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""Jane ate without pausing. Hunger was an unknown experience. She had never imagined it could actually hurt"" suggests that Jane's expectation of hunger is incorrect, and she has not experienced it before. The use of ""unknown experience"" implies that Jane's understanding of hunger is limited or inaccurate.  However, the hypothesis ""hunger could actually hurt"" is a statement that suggests a possible outcome of Jane's experience with hunger. To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.  If the premise is true, then Jane's experience of hunger is indeed an unknown experience, but it does not necessarily mean that she has never experienced hunger before. This is because the premise could be true even if Jane has experienced hunger in the past, but had no idea it was a real experience.  On the other hand, if the premise is false, then the hypothesis is also false. In this case, Jane's experience of hunger is not an unknown experience, and she has likely experienced it before. This would mean that the hypothesis ""hunger could actually hurt"" is false, because Jane's experience of hunger is actually a known and real experience.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise provides information that Jane's experience of hunger is unknown, but it does not necessarily imply that she has never experienced hunger before."	280	
1760618202	1760618202	Premise: Miss Martindale had had a school, but her rigid ideas and stern manner had frightened the children, and their parents had taken them away. And gradually the school declined, until she had to give it up and retire to end her days in the white cottage with the inevitable cat as her only companion. Breeze had never imagined that digging was such hard work.  Hypothesis: digging was such hard work  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise presents a contrast between Miss Martindale's rigid ideas and stern manner, which the children and their parents found frightening, and the contrast between the children's behavior (digging) and the truth about the difficulty of the task. However, the premise does not directly entail the hypothesis.  The hypothesis is ""digging is such hard work."" The premise provides a reason for this statement, but it does not necessarily follow that the premise itself is true. The premise could be interpreted as a commentary on the negative experience of the children, rather than an explanation for why digging is hard work."	121	
1760618202	1760618203	Premise: ``You don't need to worry. We're quite adequately chaperoned. Rosa is a woman of strict moral principles.'' If she knows I'm in here she's probably hovering outside the door right now.  Hypothesis: he's in here  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""You don't need to worry. We're quite adequately chaperoned"" is a conditional statement that suggests Rosa is in the room, but it does not directly entail the hypothesis ""he's in here.""  The conditional statement is conditional because it is phrased as ""if-then,"" which means that the hypothesis is a consequence of the premise. However, the premise does not explicitly state that Rosa is in the room, so we cannot conclude that she is in the room based solely on the premise.  The correct answer should be ""no,"" because the premise does not provide sufficient information to conclude that Rosa is in the room."	132	
1760618203	1760618203	Premise: I said you were mad to come over at this time. It's a world event. Don't you know that Venice is packed with visitors?  Hypothesis: Venice is packed with visitors  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""Venice is packed with visitors"" is an attempt to make a causal link between the premise and the hypothesis. However, the hypothesis is not necessarily true or supported by the premise.   Premise:  - Venice is packed with visitors (This statement is true, as it is known that Venice attracts many tourists and is a popular tourist destination.)  Hypothesis:  - Venice is packed with visitors (This statement is not necessarily true. It is possible that Venice is not packed with visitors, especially during off-season periods.)  The premise makes an implication that Venice is likely packed with visitors, but the hypothesis is a weaker statement that doesn't necessarily follow from the premise. It is possible to imagine scenarios where Venice is not packed, such as during a quiet time of the year or when it is not a popular tourist destination."	171	
1760618203	1760618204	Premise: And what she had said, and went on saying quietly, calmly, efficiently, was that she loved Maggie. She paid attention. At eight Maggie had not known that her grandmother was famous but she had seen that people had something in their manner when they looked at Rachel.  Hypothesis: Maggie's grandmother was famous  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that ""And what she had said, and went on saying quietly, calmly, efficiently, was that she loved Maggie."" This suggests that the speaker's grandmother is saying something nice and loving to Maggie, but it doesn't provide any information about the grandmother's fame.  In contrast, the hypothesis states that ""Maggie's grandmother was famous."" This implies a cause-and-effect relationship between the grandmother's words and her fame, but the premise doesn't establish that connection."	110	
1760618204	1760618204	Premise: They 'd seen Miss Lavant on the promenade and about the town, always walking slowly, sometimes with a neat wicker basket. Kate had often thought she was beautiful. She hadn't known she was in love with Dr Greenslade who had a wife already and three children.  Hypothesis: Miss Lavant was in love with Dr Greenslade  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise states that Kate had often thought she was beautiful, and that she ""hadn't known she was in love with Dr Greenslade"". The premise focuses on Kate's perception of her own physical appearance and her thoughts about herself, but it does not establish a direct connection between her thoughts about Dr Greenslade and her feelings for him.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Miss Lavant is in love with Dr Greenslade. The premise only hints at a possible connection between Kate's feelings and Dr Greenslade, but it does not provide any direct evidence or reason to support the hypothesis."	137	
1760618204	1760618205	Premise: Did he intend everyone in the castle to know he did not want the wife he had married in such a hurry? Did he intend to ignore her completely? Then Isabel saw Ellen's stunned face and realised that her maid at least did not know she had spent the night alone.  Hypothesis: Isabel had spent the night alone  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise states that Isabel saw Ellen's stunned face and realized that her maid did not know she had spent the night alone. This implies that Isabel's husband did not intend to keep the fact from her.  However, the premise does not directly state that Isabel's husband intended to ignore her completely. It only mentions that he did not intend to keep the fact from her, implying that he may have wanted to keep the truth from her, but did not intend to completely ignore her.  Therefore, the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis that Isabel spent the night alone. The hypothesis requires that Isabel had spent the night alone, which is not directly supported by the premise.	136	
1760618205	1760618205	Premise: Most of them young, about his age, stood and talked and drank and laughed. The two girls he had noticed earlier were standing talking to some other girls. Graham hoped they all realised that just because he was standing talking to Slater that didn't mean he was gay too.  Hypothesis: Graham was gay too  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise is setting up a situation where Graham is standing talking to a group of young people, which might suggest that he is likely gay, as he is likely in a social situation where he is around young people. However, the premise does not provide any information that would necessarily imply that Graham is gay, and it does not address the specific behavior or actions of the two girls he notices earlier. The hypothesis ""Graham is gay too"" is not supported by the premise, as it is based on an assumption that he is already gay.  A better hypothesis would be ""Graham is not gay"" or ""Graham is not in a situation where he is likely gay."" This would be more accurate and supported by the premise."	159	
1760618205	1760618206	Premise: He said that maybe I wasn't ready to join the Party just yet. Terry's passion for equality appealed to my purer mind, and his hatred of existing authority appealed to my resentments. But although I hated inequality it didn't mean I wanted to be treated like everyone else.  Hypothesis: he wanted to be treated like everyone else  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise states that the speaker's passion for equality and Terry's hatred of authority appeal to their respective minds, but it does not directly state that the speaker wants to be treated like everyone else.  The phrase ""but"" in the premise indicates a contrast or a contrastive tone, suggesting that the speaker is considering the idea of being treated like everyone else, but it does not explicitly state that they want to be treated in this way.  However, the word ""I"" in the hypothesis ""I want to be treated like everyone else"" implies that the speaker's hypothesis is a conclusion or a belief that they are motivated by this desire, rather than just being a contrast to the premise.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise sets up a contrast between Terry's appeal and the speaker's own desires, but it does not establish a direct causal relationship between the premise and the hypothesis."	184	
1760618206	1760618206	Premise: ``Oh, my poor Folly... We 've been together for five years, Lexy and I - she practically holds that company together. Of course I gave her an ``A''. But that doesn't mean I'm having an affair with her.  Hypothesis: he is having an affair with Lexy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Based on the premise, the hypothesis ""he is having an affair with Lexy"" can be supported. Here's why:  1. The premise states that Lexy ""practically holds that company together,"" implying that she is the glue that keeps Lexy and him together in their relationship. 2. The fact that Lexy gave an ""A"" to him suggests that she is invested in his success and is likely very pleased with him. 3. The fact that the speaker says ""I gave her an 'A'"" implies that they are a couple and Lexy is someone he values and respects.  The only reason the hypothesis might not be supported is if there were other factors that could suggest the speaker is having an affair with Lexy. However, the premise does not provide any information that would contradict the hypothesis. In fact, it suggests that Lexy's support and praise are positive, which would be a strong indication that she is not having an affair."	199	
1760618206	1760618207	Premise: Nevertheless, her heart sank at the thought of spending an evening with him in his present state of mind, and she was tempted to invent a sore throat in order to get out of it. But he had been very helpful over the Puddephat business, she admitted to herself, and his moods were unpredictable - he might be on top of the world by the time he arrived at the cinema. ``I'm still keen if you are '' she said brightly pretending she had not noticed anything was amiss.  Hypothesis: something was amiss  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   In the premise, the protagonist is trying to convince the other person to spend the evening with him, but he has been having a bad day and is in a bad mood. The protagonist is tempted to invent a sore throat to get out of the situation, indicating that she suspects he might be unhappy or upset.   The word ""sore throat"" is a colloquialism for a headache or a headache-like pain in the throat, which is a physical symptom that can be associated with being in a bad mood. Therefore, the premise suggests that the protagonist's suspicions about his mood are correct, and that he is indeed in a bad state of mind."	142	
1760618207	1760618208	Premise: What must it be like to be imprisoned here, day after day, month after month? I wonder, does he keep them chained and manacled, thought Fenella, or does he use sorcery? And so utterly immersed was she in this strange blue and green land that was not feeling strange any more that she did not even notice that she was weighing sorcery against steel chains and seriously considering the likely outcome.  Hypothesis: Fenella was weighing sorcery against steel chains  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	This premise is hypothesizing that Fenella is weighing the pros and cons of being imprisoned against the use of sorcery, specifically steel chains.   The premise is likely to entail the hypothesis in several ways:  1. **Fenella's introspection**: The fact that Fenella is thinking deeply about her situation and considering the options available to her suggests that she is weighing the pros and cons of her circumstances. This introspection implies that she is thinking critically and considering the potential outcomes of her situation.  2. **The use of sorcery**: The mention of sorcery implies that Fenella has some knowledge of alternative methods of restraint or punishment, which she is considering. This could be a key aspect of her hypothesis, as she is weighing the pros and cons of using sorcery against steel chains.  3. **The comparison of options**: The fact that Fenella is comparing sorcery against steel chains suggests that she is trying to make a rational decision about which option is more likely to be effective in keeping her imprisoned. This comparison implies that she is using logic and reason to evaluate the options available to her.  4. **The ambiguity of the outcome**: The fact that Fenella is uncertain about the outcome of her decision suggests that she is not entirely confident in her choice. This uncertainty implies that she is weighing the pros and cons of her decision carefully, which is consistent with the hypothesis.  However, it's worth noting that the premise is quite abstract and open-ended, and it's not clear what the actual hypothesis would entail. If the premise were to be more specific, it might be possible to identify a more concrete hypothesis.	337	
1760618208	1760618209	Premise: Strasbourg, Vienna, Bucharest, Istanbul, not stopping, not looking back. I saw her tossing newly gauffred curls as the open roadster headed east, away from Ollie... Temporarily I managed to re-erect my jocular facade, but inside I was panicking. He could take her away I thought he could just do that he has such power to hurt me this little furry creature who hasn't even noticed that I 've given up the weed.  Hypothesis: he has given up the weed  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise seems to hint at a romantic relationship where the speaker is in a tumultuous or abusive relationship. The speaker mentions ""Ollie"" and ""he"" who ""takes"" someone away, implying a sense of control or possessiveness. The mention of ""the weed"" suggests that the speaker has been trying to escape or escape from this toxic relationship.  Given the context, I would say that the premise does entail the hypothesis, but with a twist. The speaker is still trying to maintain a facade of normalcy and appear nonchalant, but inside, they are still reeling from the revelation that ""he"" has given up on the relationship.  The speaker's attempt to re-erect their jocular facade is a coping mechanism to hide their true emotions and fears about being left behind. However, the mention of ""temporarily"" implies that they may still be reeling from the aftermath, and the ""little furry creature"" (referring to the speaker) may still be a source of anxiety.  The final line ""I've given up the weed"" suggests that the speaker has given up their emotional investment in the relationship, but this may not be a complete surrender. The speaker still holds onto hope that the relationship can be salvaged, and the fact that ""he"" has given up on the relationship implies that the speaker may be holding on to the hope that things can be fixed.  In essence, the premise sets up a complex and potentially unstable dynamic, where the speaker is torn between their desire to escape the relationship and their fear of being left behind. The hypothesis that the speaker has given up the weed is thus a partial truth, as they still hold onto the hope that they can escape the relationship."	351	
1760618209	1760618210	Premise: It - the tractor, the boys and the bulbs in the earth - knew she had chosen for them and was coming back to them. Of course there was still love, there was healthy, growing love and its name was called Work. She had fallen in love with it so slowly and gently and sweetly that she had never noticed it had happened.  Hypothesis: falling in love had happened  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise is a beautiful and poetic description of a romantic encounter. To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, let's analyze the statement.  The premise states that the tractor, the boys, and the bulbs in the earth knew she had chosen for them and was coming back to them, suggesting that the speaker has some kind of supernatural or divine connection with these objects. The phrase ""its name was called Work"" implies a sense of destiny or fate.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that falling in love had happened. This statement is a straightforward declaration of the speaker's romantic experience.  While the premise and hypothesis seem to be related, they are not identical. The premise implies a more metaphysical or spiritual context, where the speaker has a direct connection with the tractor, boys, and bulbs in the earth, whereas the hypothesis is a more mundane statement about a romantic experience.  The premise sets up a sense of mystery and wonder, while the hypothesis presents a more concrete, personal experience. Therefore, it is unlikely that the premise entails the hypothesis. The two statements are distinct and convey different ideas, and the premise is more likely to be a work of fiction or poetry, while the hypothesis is more likely to be a personal or introspective statement."	256	0.9090909090909091
1760618210	1760618211	Premise: After the twelfth dot, two thirds of the way down the page, the transcript of this long session tails away into blank paper. I suppose what's happened is this. He has gone on staring out of the window thinking and she has gone on staring at him waiting with such absorption that neither of them noticed the tape had run out.  Hypothesis: the tape had run out  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise and hypothesis in this scenario are not directly related.   The premise describes a situation where the transcript of a long session has run out of paper, but it doesn't imply that the tape is the cause. Instead, it suggests that the speaker and the person they're addressing have stopped paying attention to each other due to their own distraction.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the tape ran out, which is a consequence of the premise. The premise is more of a setup to create a situation where the tape running out is a result of the characters' distraction, rather than the cause of it.	126	
1760618211	1760618211	Premise: ``His name is Matthew Blake,'' Mandy informed Charity as they descended the steps from their cabin on to the paved pathway that led to the lodge. Thankfully she hadn't even noticed that Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt and was now wearing red shorts with her white silk blouse.  Hypothesis: Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt and is now wearing red shorts with a white silk blouse, but it does not state that she had changed from the blue skirt to the red shorts. The change from the blue skirt to the red shorts is a separate action that is not mentioned in the premise. Therefore, the premise does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis that Charity had changed from the blue skirt to the red shorts.	101	
1760618211	1760618211	Premise: ``These ` ere smugglers is a dangerous bunch from wot I 've ` eard!'' ``If only we could devise a safe way of laying our hands on all that money,'' murmured Pugwash, whose greed was as proverbial as his cowardice. And the pirates were so busy discussing the problem and what they would do with the reward if they won it that they didn't notice that they were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage.  Hypothesis: the pirates were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that the pirates were being observed from the window above by the new Mayor and his entourage. This means that the pirates' actions (being observed) directly lead to the conclusion (the hypothesis) that the Mayor and his entourage are involved.  In other words, the premise establishes a cause-and-effect relationship between the pirates' actions (being observed) and the hypothesis (the Mayor and his entourage being involved). Therefore, the premise logically entails the hypothesis.	106	
1760618211	1760618212	Premise: Ockleton, Morpurgo, Cornelius, Dysart and half a dozen others too drunk to mention. But there was so much coming and going that any one of us could have slipped out, pushed Everett through the window and slipped back again without being noticed. Damn it all we didn't even notice Everett was missing until a porter tripped over him in the quad so anything's theoretically possible.  Hypothesis: Everett was missing  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	This premise suggests that a group of people were in a situation where they could easily slip out of the premises undetected. However, the main character (Everett) was the only one who was noticed missing until a porter tripped over him. This implies that Everett's disappearance was the result of a deliberate action taken by one of the others, which suggests that the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis.  The hypothesis is a conclusion that Everett was missing, but the premise is more of a setup for the situation rather than a direct cause of the hypothesis. The fact that Everett was missing doesn't necessarily mean that he was the one who slipped out of the premises. It could be that someone else did it, and the porter's action was the catalyst for the others to leave without Everett.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.	172	
1760618212	1760618213	Premise: His hair was white, as my daughters reported when they went to view the body before it was given to the Odonata. Now he is known as The Man Who Changed the World, and there are statues to him everywhere. No one remembers he had a younger brother.  Hypothesis: The Man Who Changed the World had a younger brother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise is a classic example of a ""tall tale"" or a ""dramatic story"" that is meant to be humorous or entertaining, rather than a serious scientific hypothesis. The idea of a mysterious figure being referred to as ""The Man Who Changed the World"" is a well-known example of a tall tale, and the notion that he had a younger brother is a red herring that adds to the whimsy and intrigue.  The premise is not meant to be taken literally, and the author is not suggesting that this person had a real-life sibling who played a significant role in changing the world. Instead, the story is meant to be a lighthearted and imaginative tale that explores the idea of a larger-than-life figure and the power of storytelling.  In this case, the premise does not entail the hypothesis because it is not a scientific or empirical claim that can be tested or proven. The story is more of a work of fiction that relies on the reader's imagination and interpretation. The fact that the story is meant to be humorous or entertaining is not a scientific or logical basis for the claim that the Man Who Changed the World had a younger brother.  Therefore, the premise is more of a narrative device used to create a engaging and memorable story, rather than a scientific hypothesis that can be tested and proven."	270	
1760618213	1760618214	Premise: Oh, I did, I did! I was lucky. I would have liked brothers and sisters but I don't remember that I was ever lonely.  Hypothesis: she was ever lonely  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	This premise and hypothesis are related but distinct concepts.  The premise is a statement about a person's past experience of having brothers and sisters, and their feelings of loneliness. It's a statement about the person's past life and personal history.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a statement that suggests a possible future or generalization about a person's potential future experience of loneliness.  To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.  In this case, the premise is a specific statement about a person's past, while the hypothesis is a more general statement that doesn't necessarily relate to the person's past. The premise is more of an observation or a fact about the person, while the hypothesis is an inference or a prediction about the person's future.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise is a specific statement that describes a particular aspect of the person's life, while the hypothesis is a more abstract statement that makes a general claim about the person's future.  However, it's worth noting that the hypothesis could be a reasonable inference that could be made from the premise, as it implies that the person may experience loneliness in the future, based on their past experience of having brothers and sisters.	259	
1760618214	1760618214	Premise: Her priggishness. I admire it. I know she does wrong things she tries to organize other people's lives she can't see Mr Knightley is a man in a million.  Hypothesis: Mr Knightley is a man in a million  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"I can answer your question.  The premise ""Her priggishness. I admire it. I know she does wrong things she tries to organize other people's lives she can't see Mr Knightley is a man in a million"" suggests that Mr. Knightley is admired by the narrator for his priggish behavior.   However, the premise does not directly entail the hypothesis that Mr. Knightley is a man in a million.   The hypothesis ""Mr. Knightley is a man in a million"" implies a specific characteristic or trait of Mr. Knightley that is not necessarily inferred from the given premise. The premise focuses on the narrator's admiration for Mr. Knightley's priggish behavior, but it does not provide any information that would suggest he is exceptionally good at organizing people's lives, having many friends, or being exceptionally successful.   Therefore, the premise does not logically entail the hypothesis."	186	
1760618214	1760618215	Premise: Only she herself knew the evil thoughts she had and how effortlessly they could be translated into action. ``I 'll make a cup of tea.'' No she would not tell Peter that the person he loved most in the world was dead.  Hypothesis: the person Peter loved most in the world was dead  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.   In the premise, it is stated that ""she"" is the one who knows the evil thoughts she has and how to translate them into action. This suggests that she has a level of self-awareness and control over her thoughts and emotions, which is a key aspect of the hypothesis.  The hypothesis states that ""the person Peter loved most in the world was dead,"" which implies that Peter's love for her was so strong that he would go to any extent to make her happy, even if it means putting himself in danger. The fact that she knows this and can translate her thoughts into action suggests that she has the power to influence Peter's thoughts and actions, which is a crucial aspect of the hypothesis.  Furthermore, the fact that she is the one who knows his thoughts and can translate them into action implies that she has some kind of supernatural or magical ability, which is a common trope in fiction and is often associated with the concept of love.   Overall, the premise sets up a situation where the person's love for Peter is so strong that it transcends the boundaries of rational thought and emotion, and the fact that she can manipulate Peter's thoughts and actions suggests that she has the power to shape his destiny."	255	
1760618215	1760618216	Premise: ``It's not your day, is it, dear?'' ``No, but they 've got to be done, and Shirley's making the tea.'' Ianthe had not told her mother that she sometimes had to dust the books in the library.  Hypothesis: Ianthe sometimes had to dust the books in the library  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states that ""It's not your day, is it, dear?"" This sentence implies that Ianthe's day is not typically busy or occupied in a particular way. It doesn't explicitly state that she has to dust the books in the library, but it sets up a contrast between her day and a typical day, suggesting that her day might be less eventful or less her usual routine.  The second part of the premise, ""No, but they've got to be done, and Shirley's making the tea,"" further reinforces the idea that Ianthe's day is not typical and that there's something specific she has to attend to. The phrase ""they've got to be done"" implies that there is a specific task that needs to be completed, and ""Shirley's making the tea"" suggests that this task is likely related to the library.  Given this context, it's reasonable to infer that Ianthe's day is likely to be busy or occupied, and that she has to dust the books in the library as part of this activity.  Therefore, the premise sets up a situation where the hypothesis (Ianthe having to dust the books in the library) is likely to be true, based on the context provided."	264	
1760618216	1760618217	Premise: He pulled occasionally, his arms tiring. Conker slowed a little, but the branches were coming too fast, he had to lean right forward and couldn't use his hands. He remembered the gate at the end of the track had time to hope it was open because he didn't think Conker could jump it.  Hypothesis: Conker could jump the gate  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise states that Conker ""pulled occasionally, his arms tiring"" and that ""the branches were coming too fast, he had to lean right forward and couldn't use his hands."" This suggests that Conker's arms are tired and he's struggling to hold onto the branches, which implies that he's unable to use his hands to jump the gate.  However, the premise does not mention Conker being able to jump the gate. Instead, it states that he ""didn't think he could jump it."" This indicates that Conker is uncertain or unable to jump the gate, contradicting the hypothesis that he could jump it.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	141	
1760618217	1760618217	Premise: But he ended up eating it himself. I was reluctant to kiss my mother, afraid that somehow her weakness and unhappiness would infect me. Naturally I didn't think for a minute that my life and spirit could stimulate her.  Hypothesis: her life and spirit could stimulate her mother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	This premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise describes a situation where the speaker is hesitant to kiss their mother due to their fear that she may be weak or unhappy, implying that their mother's well-being might affect them.   The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the speaker's mother's life and spirit could stimulate her mother.   To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to imply that the speaker's mother's well-being is directly affected by the speaker's actions (kissing her), which is not the case in the given premise.	114	
1760618217	1760618218	Premise: ``Ely,'' I said (that was her name and the first time I 'd ever used it), ``I want to be free.'' She looked stunned. I don't think she 'd considered this.  Hypothesis: Ely had considered him wanting to be free  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise and the hypothesis are not directly related.  The premise states that ""Ely said (that was her name and the first time I'd ever used it),"" which implies that Ely had not used her name before, or that she was unknown to the speaker.   The hypothesis states ""I want to be free,"" which suggests that the speaker is expressing a desire to be free from something, but it does not necessarily imply that Ely had considered this before.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The hypothesis is an independent statement that expresses the speaker's desire to be free, which is not necessarily linked to the initial statement about Ely's name."	138	
1760618218	1760618218	Premise: I'm sorry, I 've put you in an invidious position. If you're being run by Morton, he 'll want to hear all this. It won't do any harm but I 'd rather not give him food for thought because I consider him an idiot and I don't think he's capable of interpreting it correctly.  Hypothesis: Morton is capable of interpreting this food for thought correctly  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise suggests that if Morton is running you, he will interpret the information correctly. However, this premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis that Morton is capable of interpreting the information correctly.  The hypothesis is ""Morton is capable of interpreting this food for thought correctly"". This means that the hypothesis assumes that Morton is intelligent, rational, and able to understand the information in question.  The premise implies that Morton is in control of your thoughts, but it doesn't guarantee that he is capable of understanding the information. It's possible that Morton is simply using the information to manipulate or influence your thoughts, without necessarily understanding its content.  Therefore, the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis, as the hypothesis requires more than just the presence of Morton's control over your thoughts."	156	
1760618218	1760618219	Premise: The big Norwegian shook his head, frowning. ``Jeg fonstAr ikke.'' I don't think he found Ward's accent at all easy and anyway like many foreigners he found it easier to speak English than to understand it.  Hypothesis: the big Norwegian found Ward's accent at all easy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the big Norwegian found the accent ""easier"" to understand than to speak, but it does not imply that the accent is inherently easier to understand. The Norwegian speaker's difficulty with Ward's accent is a specific observation about Ward's accent, not a general statement about accents in general.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the big Norwegian found the accent ""easier"" to speak. This is not supported by the premise, which only mentions that the Norwegian speaker found the accent ""easier"" to understand, not to speak. The hypothesis is based on a specific observation that is not universally applicable to all foreigners or accents.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	154	
1760618219	1760618220	Premise: You really don't know anything about me, do you, despite all that wallowing in my mind? As it happens I don't think I'm the right person to lead humanity into the future no.  Hypothesis: she is the right person to lead humanity into the future  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"What a thought-provoking premise!  At first glance, it might seem counterintuitive that the premise entails the hypothesis, but upon closer examination, I'd argue that it actually does.  The premise ""you really don't know anything about me, despite all that wallowing in my mind"" suggests that you have a certain level of self-awareness and introspection, which implies that you have some level of self-awareness about your own thoughts and emotions. This self-awareness is often considered a key characteristic of intelligence, and in this context, it might be interpreted as a sign of cognitive ability.  However, the hypothesis ""she is the right person to lead humanity into the future"" suggests that you think she has some unique perspective or insight that is superior to your own. This perspective implies that she possesses some level of knowledge or understanding about the future that is not currently available to you.  Given that the premise suggests that you have a certain level of self-awareness and introspection, but the hypothesis suggests that you think she has a superior perspective, the premise does entail the hypothesis. The premise sets the stage for the hypothesis, which is a statement about her being the right person for the task of leading humanity into the future.  In other words, the premise establishes a connection between your self-awareness and her potential leadership abilities, which is the hypothesis that she is the right person for the task."	287	
1760618220	1760618220	Premise: It's where the bands practise. I can't remember what band Petra's in, but I seen them practise once. They were OK but I didn't think they was brilliant.  Hypothesis: Petra's band was brilliant  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""It's where the bands practise"" is a descriptive phrase that implies the bands are likely a rock band.   The hypothesis ""Petra's band was brilliant"" is a statement that is supported by the premise, but it is not necessarily true. The premise is descriptive, and it does not necessarily imply that Petra is a real band.   However, the premise is a good starting point for a hypothesis because it provides context and a general idea of what the premise might be referring to. The phrase ""where the bands practise"" could be a metaphorical expression for a music venue, concert hall, or other location where music is performed."	131	
1760618220	1760618221	Premise: She swallowed hard, unsure if she had the nerve to go ahead. The memory of the pain in Tara's eyes last night decided her. Did he really expect her to believe that Tara was only the housekeeper?  Hypothesis: Tara was only the housekeeper  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""She swallowed hard, unsure if she had the nerve to go ahead"" suggests that Tara's decision to investigate Tara's alibi and potentially confront her about the alleged infidelity is motivated by a strong sense of fear or anxiety. This fear is fueled by the memory of the pain in Tara's eyes, implying that Tara is likely emotionally hurt or betrayed by Tara's actions.  The hypothesis ""Tara was only the housekeeper"" is not supported by the premise. The premise implies that Tara is taking a bold step to uncover the truth, which suggests that she is not just a passive observer or bystander. Tara's decision to investigate further and confront the issue is not driven by a lack of nerve, but rather by a desire to address the pain and hurt caused by Tara's actions.  Instead, the premise creates a situation where Tara is being driven by a strong emotional response to the perceived betrayal, making it likely that Tara is not just the housekeeper."	197	
1760618221	1760618222	Premise: If there are spirits at work at the time, they come only from yourself, not from the fume of the incense. Why should spirits aid living beings? What arrogance is it that drives people to believe they can have power over them?  Hypothesis: people can have power over spirits  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise, ""If there are spirits at work at the time, they come only from yourself, not from the fume of the incense,"" can be interpreted in two ways. One possible understanding is that the premise suggests that spirits are a product of the mind or consciousness, implying that they are not external entities that can be controlled or influenced. In this view, the hypothesis ""people can have power over spirits"" would be ""If there are spirits, then people can influence or control them."" This perspective suggests that the power comes from the individual's consciousness and intentions, rather than from any external source.  The other possible interpretation is that the premise implies that the spirits are not a separate entity, but rather a manifestation of the individual's own subconscious mind. In this case, the hypothesis ""people can have power over spirits"" would be ""If people can have power over spirits, then the spirits are a product of the mind."" This perspective suggests that the power comes from the individual's ability to influence their own thoughts and emotions, rather than from any external source.  Based on this analysis, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise focuses on the nature of spirits as a product of the mind, but it does not provide any information about the nature of the mind or the mechanisms by which spirits can influence the mind. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the power comes from the individual's consciousness and intentions, but it does not provide any information about the mind's ability to influence the world. Therefore, the premise does not provide sufficient information to support the hypothesis."	321	
1760618222	1760618222	Premise: Why should this topic matter? You talked about everything else as you usually do. Why should I feel Maelmuire is important?  Hypothesis: Maelmuire is important  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	This conversation just started, and we haven't discussed anything yet. I'm happy to chat with you, but I don't have any information to draw from. Would you like to start discussing Maelmuire or a specific topic?	48	
1760618222	1760618223	Premise: It is all very well, in these changing times, to adapt one's work to take in duties not traditionally within one's realm. But bantering is of another dimension altogether. For one thing how would one know for sure that at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected?  Hypothesis: at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"I'd argue that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise suggests that one's response to a bantering exchange is predetermined and always expected, which implies a level of certainty that may not be present in reality.  In reality, people's responses to banter can vary greatly, and there is no guarantee that a particular response will always be expected. Even in situations where one assumes that a banter exchange is about to unfold, there may be unanticipated twists or turns that can shift the dynamic and require a response that is not anticipated.  Additionally, the term ""banter"" can be subjective and context-dependent, and what one person considers a typical response to a banter exchange, another person may not find amusing or relevant. People can also have different personalities, interests, and communication styles, which can influence how they respond to banter.  Therefore, while the premise may be a useful hypothesis for a thought experiment or a creative writing exercise, it does not accurately reflect the complexities and uncertainties of real-life interactions, where responses are often unpredictable and context-dependent."	217	1.0
1760618223	1760618224	Premise: But the horror of losing was as much to do with money as with pride. Biddy had never let them down, come without fail all through the bad weather, and now was giving Nails an intensive course on her own horse which - in terms of money - was worth another couple of hundred pounds. Yet surely she knew they had no way of paying should she demand it?  Hypothesis: they had no way of paying  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise sets up a situation where Biddy is trying to pay Nails for her horse training course, but she is aware that Nails is unlikely to be able to pay her because they have no money. This creates a problem that Biddy is struggling with, which is her desire to pay Nails for the course.  The premise establishes the following elements that support the hypothesis:  1. **Biddy's expectation of payment**: Biddy has already invested time and money into the course, and now she is facing a problem in getting it paid for. 2. **Nails' unwillingness to pay**: Nails is unwilling to pay Biddy, which creates a conflict between the two parties. 3. **The lack of an alternative solution**: There is no mention of Biddy having a plan to find another way to pay Nails, which suggests that the situation is beyond her control.  Therefore, the premise establishes a logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis, which is that Biddy has no way of paying Nails for the course.	226	
1760618224	1760618224	Premise: I ducked so fast I wasn't sure whether he 'd seen me or not, but it gave me a prickly feeling just to imagine it, so I scuttled for the door and legged it up the spiral stairway three steps at a time, just in case. As I ran, I remember thinking stupid thoughts like. How did he know I was up here looking down?  Hypothesis: he was up there looking down  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"This premise and hypothesis do not entail each other.  The premise describes a hypothetical situation where the narrator is in a situation where they are about to run away from someone (possibly an abusive or threatening situation), and they imagine a ""prickly feeling"" of fear or anxiety that they don't want to admit to themselves. The premise is more focused on the emotional state of the narrator, describing their thoughts and feelings, rather than a specific event or situation.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a specific question about the narrator's suspicions about whether someone is watching them. It is a question that arises from the premise, but it is not necessarily a logical consequence of the premise.  In other words, the premise sets up a situation where the narrator is thinking about their own feelings and the possibility of being watched, but it doesn't necessarily imply that someone else is watching them. The hypothesis is a separate question that is not directly supported by the premise.  If the premise were to be expanded to include a specific event or situation where the narrator is actually being watched, then the hypothesis could potentially be supported by the premise, as the narrator's thoughts about being watched would be a direct result of the premise. However, as written, the premise does not establish a direct connection between the two."	263	
1760618224	1760618225	Premise: At the heart of the universe there is cruelty. We are predators and are preyed upon, every living thing. Did you know that wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds piercing the weak spot in their armour?  Hypothesis: wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise states that ""At the heart of the universe there is cruelty. We are predators and are preyed upon, every living thing."" This statement appears to be a philosophical or existentialist perspective on the nature of the universe.  However, the hypothesis ""wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds"" seems to be a biological fact. The statement can be tested by observing the natural behavior of wasps and ladybirds.  The premise mentions the concept of predation, which is a fundamental aspect of life on Earth. The statement implies that predators (wasps) prey on prey (ladybirds), which is a well-documented fact.   The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a specific scientific fact. Ladybirds, the subject of the premise, are known to lay eggs in wasps. This is a biological process that is supported by extensive research and observations.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise is a philosophical statement that sets up a hypothetical scenario, while the hypothesis is a specific, verifiable fact. The two statements are mutually exclusive, and the truth of the premise does not necessarily imply the truth of the hypothesis."	235	
1760618225	1760618226	Premise: ``I wanted to tell you. But the Bookman asked me to keep our meeting a secret.'' How did you know I 'd met him?  Hypothesis: he had met the Bookman  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""I wanted to tell you. But the Bookman asked me to keep our meeting a secret"" implies that the speaker has a prior understanding or knowledge about the Bookman and their intentions. This suggests that the speaker has indeed met the Bookman.  My reasoning is as follows:  1. The phrase ""I wanted to tell you"" indicates that the speaker has a personal or private matter to share, which implies they have already communicated with someone about it. 2. The fact that the Bookman ""asked me to keep our meeting a secret"" suggests that the speaker has a prior understanding or arrangement with the Bookman, which is not publicly known or shared with anyone else.  Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the speaker has met the Bookman, and the premise does indeed entail the hypothesis that the speaker had met the Bookman."	177	
1760618226	1760618227	Premise: She rubbed them away with an angry fist. She was a fool to let anyone get round her. How long before she learned that folk 'll always take advantage of weakness?  Hypothesis: folk 'll always take advantage of weakness  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""She rubbed them away with an angry fist"" and the hypothesis ""folk 'll always take advantage of weakness"" are not directly related in a logical or causal manner.  The premise seems to imply a situation where someone is reacting to a perceived weakness (the fist) and is trying to assert dominance or control. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests a general statement about human nature, implying that people will always take advantage of those who are weak.  However, the two statements are not causally connected. The premise is an example of a reactive situation (the person reacting to the perceived weakness), while the hypothesis is an abstract statement about human nature (people taking advantage of weakness).  To make the premise entail the hypothesis, there would need to be a chain of cause-and-effect relationships between the two. For example, if the person who rubbed their fist away with anger is weak and is subsequently taken advantage of by others, then the premise could potentially lead to the hypothesis.  In the context of the story, it's unclear how the premise would directly link to the hypothesis. The premise is more of a dramatic or provocative statement, rather than a logical consequence of the hypothesis."	242	
1760618227	1760618227	Premise: At length she decided that there was nothing to be gained by worrying her. Probably there was some quite innocent explanation, which Roger Kenyon would give her when she returned the wallet - if, indeed, it were his. And yet why had his manner changed so abruptly when he learned that the girl whose hat he had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage?  Hypothesis: the girl whose hat Roger Kenyon had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that Roger Kenyon's manner changed when he learned that the girl whose hat he rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage. This implies that his change in behavior is directly related to his knowledge of the girl's new address.  If the hypothesis is correct, then Roger Kenyon's change in behavior should be due to the girl's new address, which is the thing that he knows. In other words, the hypothesis is a direct consequence of the premise.  However, the premise does not explicitly state that the girl's new address is related to her living at Sunset Cottage. It only states that the girl whose hat he rescued was going to live there, without providing any additional information about the girl's new address. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, and it is not a sufficient condition for the hypothesis to be true.	181	
1760618227	1760618228	Premise: Anna looked at Peter again and said to herself in a guilty whisper, ``Will he become even more difficult?'' She wondered if a stranger could tell that he was difficult, just by looking at him. Would such a person watching Peter now reading the prayers of Rite B in his level pleasant voice notice that resentment lay like his blood just under his skin because the life he had chosen had not turned out as he had expected it to?  Hypothesis: resentment lay just under Peter's skin  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that ""resentment lay just under Peter's skin,"" which implies that resentment is a physical manifestation of something internal, possibly a feeling of anger or frustration. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that ""resentment lay just under Peter's skin,"" which implies that resentment is a physical sensation that can be directly observed, rather than just being an internal feeling.  The key difference is that resentment is not a physical sensation, but rather an emotional state that can be perceived through observation. The premise focuses on Peter's internal experience of feeling resentful, while the hypothesis focuses on a physical manifestation of that feeling. Therefore, the premise does not logically entail the hypothesis."	149	
1760618228	1760618229	Premise: Jean was tough and liked to drink. She would endure for a long while yet. But what would she do when she realized that with things as they were she was on a life sentence not just a temporary suspension of essential pleasure?  Hypothesis: Jean was on a life sentence  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise states that Jean is tough and likes to drink, but when she realizes she's on a life sentence, which implies a temporary suspension of pleasure. This premise could be considered as a starting point for the hypothesis that Jean is on a life sentence.  However, I would argue that the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis.  The premise focuses on Jean's personality traits (tough and enjoys drinking) and her situation (being on a life sentence), without providing any information about the duration of the sentence or its impact on her personality or behavior. It doesn't establish a direct causal link between her personality and the sentence.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, implies that the sentence has a direct causal relationship with Jean's personality. If we assume that the sentence is indeed a life sentence, then it's more likely that Jean's personality traits, such as her toughness and love for drinking, are influenced by the sentence.  Therefore, the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis, and we would need additional information to establish a causal link between the sentence and Jean's personality.	220	
1760618229	1760618229	Premise: ``Clever''. Klug means ``clever''. Would you say that Abie was clever?  Hypothesis: Abie was clever  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise is ""Klug means 'clever'"", and the hypothesis is ""Abie was clever"". The premise is a definition or a statement of fact about the word ""Klug"", but it does not make a claim about Abie's character or behavior.   In order for the premise to entail the hypothesis, there would need to be a logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis. However, the premise does not provide any information about Abie, and the hypothesis is a statement about Abie's character, not a statement about the word ""Klug""."	126	1.0
1760618229	1760618230	Premise: The Susweca. It means ``dragonfly'' in Sioux, you know. Did I ever tell you that's where Paul and I met?  Hypothesis: Susweca is where she and Paul met  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise and hypothesis are not directly related. The premise is about the word ""Susweca,"" which is the Sioux word for ""dragonfly."" It's a geographical location. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a statement about the meeting between Paul and you.  To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to examine the relationship between the two statements.  - The premise is a statement about the word ""Susweca."" - The hypothesis is a statement about the meeting between Paul and you.  Since the premise is a word (a noun) and the hypothesis is a statement (a verb), the premise is not a cause or effect of the hypothesis. The hypothesis is not a specific instance or example of the word ""Susweca."" Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	166	
1760618230	1760618230	Premise: How do you know? she was going to ask, but his smile was answer enough. If DeVore said there was going to be a vacancy there would be a vacancy.  Hypothesis: there was going to be a vacancy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""she was going to ask"" implies a future action, which is not present in the statement ""there was going to be a vacancy."" A vacancy implies an absence of an individual or position, whereas asking is an action that is happening now. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  In this case, the hypothesis is a statement about a future event (""there was going to be a vacancy""), and the premise is a statement about the speaker's action (""she was going to ask""). The two statements are related but distinct, and the premise does not provide sufficient information to support the hypothesis."	124	
1760618230	1760618231	Premise: She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked. Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit, then came out and was not very successful in finding a job to suit him. That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them.  Hypothesis: it was Edward's fault  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married"" is an attempt to establish a causal relationship between the actions of the characters and the events that unfolded.  The premise implies that the decision to marry was made after a period of time, and that Edward stayed in the Engineers, which could be a deliberate choice. This suggests that the decision to marry was influenced by Edward's actions, specifically his decision to stay in the Engineers.  However, the premise does not explicitly state that the decision to marry was the result of Edward's actions, but rather that he stayed in the Engineers, which could be seen as a contributing factor to the decision.   Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis that it was Edward's fault. The hypothesis ""it was Edward's fault"" is not directly supported by the premise, as it is more focused on the decision to marry rather than the specific actions that led to it."	195
