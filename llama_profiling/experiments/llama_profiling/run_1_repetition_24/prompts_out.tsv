1760523232	1760523234	Premise: It was a complex language. Not written down but handed down. One might say it was peeled down.  Hypothesis: the language was peeled down  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the language was ""peeled down,"" which implies that it was once written down but has been simplified or reduced to its essentials. However, the hypothesis states that the language was ""handed down,"" which implies that it was passed down through oral tradition rather than being written down. These two ideas are not necessarily connected, and it is possible for a language to be both peeled down and handed down.  Therefore, while the premise provides some context for the hypothesis, it does not directly entail it."	127
1760523234	1760523237	Premise: It is part of their religion, a religion I do not scoff at as it holds many elements which match our own even though it lacks the truth of ours. At one of their great festivals they have the ritual of driving out the devils from their bodies. First the drummers come on - I may say that no women are allowed to take part in this ritual and the ladies here will perhaps agree with me that they are fortunate in that omission.  Hypothesis: no women are allowed to take part in this ritual  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that the religion of the people in question has the ritual of driving out devils from their bodies during one of their festivals, and that no women are allowed to take part in this ritual. The hypothesis then logically follows that no women are allowed to take part in this ritual.  The premise provides the necessary information to deduce the hypothesis, as it specifies the restriction on who can participate in the ritual. Without the premise, it would not be possible to know whether women are allowed to participate in the ritual or not. Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis.	143
1760523237	1760523241	Premise: The Paris to Rouen railway was being extended to Le Havre, and the line cut straight through Dr Flaubert's land. Part of it was to be compulsorily purchased. You could say that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy.  Hypothesis: Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states that the Paris to Rouen railway was being extended to Le Havre, and part of it was to be compulsorily purchased. This means that Gustave Flaubert's land was affected by the construction of the railway, which could potentially disrupt his daily life and work.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that Gustave was ""shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy."" Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that can cause seizures and other symptoms, and it's possible that Gustave's epilepsy could have been triggered or exacerbated by the stress and disruption caused by the railway construction.  Given the premise, it's reasonable to assume that Gustave's epilepsy may have played a role in his decision to retreat to Croisset and focus on his writing. The isolation and quiet of Croisset may have provided him with the peace and quiet he needed to focus on his creative work, which was already suffering due to the railway construction.  Therefore, the premise provides a context in which the hypothesis could be true, and it's a logical conclusion based on the information provided."	281
1760523241	1760523243	Premise: Part of it was to be compulsorily purchased. You could say that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy. You could also say he was driven there by the railway.  Hypothesis: Gustave was driven to creative retreat in Croisset by the railway  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise provides two possible reasons why Gustave was sent to the creative retreat at Croisset: compulsory purchase and being driven by the railway. The hypothesis only suggests that Gustave was driven to Croisset by the railway, but does not rule out the possibility that he was also compulsorily purchased.  Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are not logically connected, and the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise.	106
1760523243	1760523245	Premise: Some of them, like for instance the farm in Connecticut, are quite small. If I like a place I buy it. I guess you could say it's a hobby.  Hypothesis: buying places is a hobby  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that some of the places the speaker is interested in are small, and the speaker buys them as a hobby. This implies that buying places is a hobby for the speaker, as they are acquiring them as a recreational activity rather than for any other purpose.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that buying places is a hobby. This is a direct conclusion that can be drawn from the premise, as the speaker has expressed their interest in buying small places as a hobby.  Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis by providing additional information that supports the hypothesis.	146
1760523245	1760523247	Premise: Look, my dear, I'm not in my dotage yet, and I know I'm a grumbler and a complainer. You could say the only form of comfort I 've got are my complaints.  Hypothesis: the only form of comfort he has are his complaints  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that the person is not in their dotage yet, which implies that they are still mentally capable of thinking and expressing themselves. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the only form of comfort they have are their complaints. Given the premise, it is reasonable to assume that the person finds comfort in expressing their complaints, as they are mentally capable of doing so.  In other words, the premise provides a foundation for the hypothesis by ruling out the possibility that the person is mentally impaired or incapable of expressing themselves, which would render the hypothesis unlikely. By assuming that the person is mentally competent, we can infer that they find comfort in their complaints.	166
1760523247	1760523250	Premise: Then the silence in the Zoo became complete. Woil stared around him and then suddenly with a push of his wings raised himself into the air, turned, and landed ten feet away on the back of a green bench. Creggan could see that he was afraid and that his fear was making him terribly uncertain.  Hypothesis: Woil was afraid  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that the silence in the zoo became complete, and then Woil stared around him before raising himself into the air and landing on a bench. This suggests that Woil was aware of his surroundings and was able to move around, which implies that he was not in a state of complete immobility or unconsciousness.  Furthermore, the fact that Woil was afraid is explicitly stated in the passage, which suggests that his fear was a significant factor in his actions. The passage states that his fear was making him terribly uncertain, which implies that he was experiencing a high level of anxiety or apprehension.  Therefore, based on the information provided in the passage, it can be inferred that Woil was afraid.	171
1760523250	1760523252	Premise: But, of course, that just wasn't possible. Her disappointment over Jonathan, which had driven her to France in the first place, had been relegated somewhere to the back of her mind. Now in retrospect she could see that marriage to him would have been a ghastly mistake and that her reaction to discovering that he had been seeing other women while he had been engaged to her had had far more to do with wounded pride than with a wounded heart.  Hypothesis: marriage to Jonathan would have been a ghastly mistake  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that the protagonist's disappointment over Jonathan had been relegated to the back of her mind, implying that she had already come to terms with the fact that marriage to him would not have been a good idea. The hypothesis, on the other hand, directly states that marriage to Jonathan would have been a ghastly mistake.  Given the premise, it is logical to conclude that the protagonist had already formed this opinion about Jonathan, which is why she was able to put her disappointment aside and move on. Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis.	135
1760523252	1760523255	Premise: Like now. The Community in Knockglen would defend Eve vociferously. Even some of the Sisters here in Dublin might see that the girl had a point.  Hypothesis: the girl had a point  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise and hypothesis do not entail each other.  The premise states that the community in Knockglen would defend Eve vociferously, and some of the Sisters in Dublin might see that the girl had a point. This suggests that there are conflicting views on the matter, and it is not necessarily the case that the girl has a point.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the girl had a point. This implies that there is a clear conclusion that can be drawn from the situation, which is not explicitly stated in the premise.  Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are not logically connected, and the hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the premise.	149
1760523255	1760523257	Premise: ``They have to be crushed, Bobkins!'' So saying, she marched off down the gravel path, making the kind of crunching noise Robert had thought could only be produced by the BBC sound-effects department. As they rounded the edge of the building he could see that behind the house was a vast garden.  Hypothesis: behind the house was a vast garden  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise ""They have to be crushed, Bobkins!"" suggests that something is being crushed, and the hypothesis ""behind the house was a vast garden"" provides a location where the crushing could be taking place. The phrase ""behind the house"" implies that the garden is located in the back of the property, which is consistent with the idea of something being crushed.  Furthermore, the use of the word ""vast"" to describe the garden suggests that it is a significant area, which would be necessary to accommodate the crushing that the premise implies is taking place.  Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are logically connected, and the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise."	161
1760523257	1760523260	Premise: ``Do you mind if I use your phone?'' Ronni could see that Guido's brain was whirring.  Hypothesis: Guido's brain was whirring  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise ""Do you mind if I use your phone?"" suggests that Guido is asking for permission to use Ronni's phone, which implies that he does not have access to a phone of his own. This is an inference that can be drawn from the context of the situation, but it does not necessarily imply that Guido's brain is whirring.  The hypothesis ""Guido's brain was whirring"" is a statement about Guido's mental state, which cannot be inferred from the premise alone. It is possible that Guido's brain is whirring for reasons unrelated to the request to use Ronni's phone, such as because he is thinking deeply about a problem or because he is feeling anxious.  Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are not logically connected, and the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	197
1760523260	1760523263	Premise: ``Look, lady, give me a break. I just deliver the stuff, I don't interview it for the Sunday papers.'' He waved the paper at her and even at a distance she could see that it said very little.  Hypothesis: the paper said very little  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the premise ""Look, lady, give me a break. I just deliver the stuff, I don't interview it for the Sunday papers"" entails the hypothesis ""the paper said very little"" because it implies that the content of the paper is not substantial or newsworthy enough to warrant an interview.  The premise suggests that the delivery person is not responsible for creating or reporting the content of the paper, but rather they are simply tasked with delivering it. By extension, if the person is not involved in creating the content, then the paper itself must not have said much.  Therefore, the hypothesis that the paper said very little follows logically from the premise, as it suggests that the content of the paper is not extensive or notable enough to warrant an interview."	167
1760523263	1760523267	Premise: ``You 've heard something like that before. Haven't you, Jimmy?'' Jimmy had been shaken by those sounds more shaken than the others for good reason but Cardiff could see that he was unprepared to show it as he pushed himself away from the reception counter.  Hypothesis: Jimmy was unprepared to show he had been shaken  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the premise ""You've heard something like that before. Haven't you, Jimmy?"" entails the hypothesis ""Jimmy was unprepared to show he had been shaken."" Here's why:  The premise suggests that Jimmy has heard something similar to what he just heard before, which implies that he has experienced similar situations in the past. This creates an expectation that Jimmy should have been prepared to handle the current situation, but the fact that he is unprepared suggests that he is not as emotionally resilient as he appears to be.  The phrase ""Haven't you, Jimmy?"" also implies a sense of familiarity or routine, implying that Jimmy has experienced similar situations before. This further reinforces the idea that Jimmy should have been prepared to handle the current situation, but his lack of preparation suggests that he is not as emotionally resilient as he appears to be.  Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis that Jimmy was unprepared to show he had been shaken, as the premise suggests that Jimmy has experienced similar situations before and should have been better prepared to handle the current situation, but his lack of preparation implies that he is not as emotionally resilient as he appears to be."	270
1760523267	1760523269	Premise: It was Alan's idea. He made a sour kind of joke out of it, that they must wait until their wedding night. Carolyn agreed because she could see he meant it although she didn't understand why.  Hypothesis: Alan meant it  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that Alan made a sour kind of joke about waiting until their wedding night to consummate their marriage, which implies that he intended to wait until then. The fact that Carolyn agreed with him suggests that she understood his intentions and was willing to go along with them.  Therefore, the premise provides evidence that Alan meant what he said, which is the hypothesis being tested. The hypothesis is not simply asserted, but is instead logically implied by the premise.	116
1760523269	1760523271	Premise: And why bother to write anyway? What was there to say? Mary had some vague idea that Adam's parents might suspect he was down here and come to see him.  Hypothesis: Adam was down here  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise ""Mary had some vague idea that Adam's parents might suspect he was down here and come to see him"" does not logically imply that Adam is actually down there. It simply suggests that Mary has a suspicion or fear that Adam's parents might be looking for him in that location.  The hypothesis ""Adam was down here"" is a separate statement that is not necessarily implied by the premise. It is possible that Adam is not actually down there, despite Mary's suspicions.  Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are not logically connected, and the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise."	149
1760523271	1760523273	Premise: ``And you're not having this dress,'' Nora said, bending down to look at the price tag. ``It's two and a half guineas!'' she hissed at Louise who could tell that she was genuinely appalled.  Hypothesis: Nora was genuinely appalled  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states that Nora said ""And you're not having this dress"" and bent down to look at the price tag. This implies that Nora was interested in the dress and was surprised by the price, which is consistent with the hypothesis that she was genuinely appalled.  The use of the word ""hissed"" to describe Nora's reaction also suggests that she was genuinely upset by the price, as it implies a sense of disbelief or indignation.  Overall, the premise provides evidence that supports the hypothesis that Nora was genuinely appalled by the price of the dress."	152
1760523273	1760523277	Premise: She said good morning to Alice and Alice said hallo. She was thin and rather tall with a very lined gentle face and hair that was white but which Alice could see had once been blonde. She could also have told this was Tina's mother before Mrs Darne went off down the passage that led to the Headmaster's Flat.  Hypothesis: this was Tina's mother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise provides some descriptive information about the woman that Alice encountered, including her height, facial features, and hair color. The hypothesis, in turn, logically deduces that the woman is Tina's mother based on these observations.  Here's why:  1. The woman is described as thin and rather tall, which suggests that she is an adult. 2. Her face is said to be gentle and lined, which could indicate age and experience. 3. Her hair is described as white, but Alice can see that it was once blonde. This could suggest that the woman is older and has had time to grow her hair out. 4. The passage mentions that the woman went down the passage that led to the Headmaster's Flat, which implies that she is a staff member at the school.  Given these details, it is reasonable to deduce that the woman is Tina's mother, as she is a staff member at the school and has a gentle, lined face that suggests age and experience.  In summary, the premise provides the necessary descriptive information to entail the hypothesis that the woman is Tina's mother.	259
1760523277	1760523280	Premise: She might have sat all afternoon, nibbling and stuporous, exhausted but not sleepy. But the glazier finally came down from the upper floor, cheerfully announcing that all was now right and tight and he would be on his way. Maggie could tell that he would have liked to stop for a chat that he felt sorry for her left on her own but she lacked either her grandmother's grace or her mother's energy so she did not offer him tea.  Hypothesis: the glazier would have liked to stop for a chat  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that the glazier finally came down from the upper floor and announced that everything was now right and tight, indicating that he had finished his work. This implies that the glazier was present in the house for some time, possibly working on the windows or other tasks.  The hypothesis states that the glazier would have liked to stop for a chat, which suggests that he had a desire to engage in conversation with Maggie. This desire is entailed by the premise, as the glazier's presence in the house and his announcement that he had finished his work implies that he had the opportunity to stop and chat with Maggie, but she did not offer him tea.  Therefore, the premise provides evidence to support the hypothesis, as it suggests that the glazier had a desire to interact with Maggie but she did not reciprocate.	197
1760523280	1760523283	Premise: Jim waited. He waited a long time, and when the young doctor finally came out, it was almost dark. Jim could nonetheless tell by his anxious face that something was wrong.  Hypothesis: something was wrong  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the premise ""Jim waited. He waited a long time, and when the young doctor finally came out, it was almost dark. Jim could nonetheless tell by his anxious face that something was wrong"" does entail the hypothesis ""something was wrong"".  The premise provides evidence that something is amiss, as Jim can tell by the doctor's anxious face that he is not acting normally. This is the basis for the hypothesis that something is wrong. The premise sets the stage for the hypothesis by establishing that something unusual is occurring, and the hypothesis fills in the details by specifying what that something is (i.e., that something is wrong).  In other words, the premise provides the context and the hypothesis provides the specific information about what is going on in that context. Together, they form a cohesive and logical argument that something is wrong."	185
1760523283	1760523286	Premise: ``Yes?'' ``Nathan?'' He could tell it was long-distance the line was so gravelly and hollow but he didn't recognise the voice.  Hypothesis: the call was long-distance  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the premise ""Yes? Nathan?"" does entail the hypothesis ""the call was long-distance."" Here's why:  The premise provides evidence that the call was not made from a nearby location, as the voice on the other end sounded gravelly and hollow. This suggests that the call was made from a distance away, which is consistent with a long-distance call.  Without the premise, it's possible that the call could have been made from a nearby location with a poor connection or a lot of background noise, which could also result in a gravelly and hollow sound. However, the premise provides additional information that rules out this possibility and suggests that the call was actually made from a distance away.  Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis that the call was long-distance."	175
1760523286	1760523288	Premise: Chopra stood unsteadily on his feet. The shapechanger bounded around with excitement. Chopra could tell something had happened.  Hypothesis: something had happened  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Chopra stood unsteadily on his feet, which could be due to a variety of reasons, such as dizziness, intoxication, or simply being off-balance. It does not necessarily imply that something has happened to him.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, implies that something has happened to Chopra, which is a more specific and definitive statement. It is possible that the shapechanger's excitement is unrelated to any event that has occurred to Chopra.  Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are not logically connected, and the hypothesis cannot be inferred directly from the premise.	153
1760523288	1760523290	Premise: It seemed impossible that anyone could endure such pain for so long, but at last the doors of the Renault slammed and there was comparative silence. The engine was started up, revving violently as the car was turned round on the narrow road. John could tell that it was being driven back up the hill towards Putna.  Hypothesis: the car was being driven back up the hill towards Putna  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that the doors of the Renault slammed and there was comparative silence, indicating that the car had stopped moving. The hypothesis states that the car was being driven back up the hill towards Putna, which is the only possible direction the car could be moving in considering the premise.  Therefore, the premise logically entails the hypothesis, as the stopping of the car and the subsequent starting of the engine suggest that the car is being driven in the direction of Putna.	115
1760523290	1760523293	Premise: Just when you think you 've got it straight, along comes the Fool with his pig's bladder and whops you on the nose. By the way, I'm no idiot. I could tell Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see me at the airport.  Hypothesis: Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see her at the airport  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that ""Just when you think you 've got it straight, along comes the Fool with his pig's bladder and whops you on the nose."" This is a metaphorical statement that suggests that unexpected events can occur at any time and upset your understanding or expectations.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a specific statement that Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see the narrator at the airport. This statement is logically implied by the premise, as the narrator's arrival at the airport is an unexpected event that could potentially cause displeasure or surprise in the minds of Gillian and Stuart.  Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis, as the latter is a logical consequence of the former."	181
1760523293	1760523295	Premise: He's weird enough to have undressed me without thinking, according to some mad notion of the ``proper'' thing to do. Perhaps he thought I couldn't lie in bed with my clothes on.  Hypothesis: she couldn't lie in bed with her clothes on  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the man undressed the woman without thinking, suggesting that he acted impulsively or without proper consideration. However, the hypothesis implies that the woman cannot lie in bed with her clothes on, which is not necessarily true. It is possible that the man undressed her without thinking because he believed it was the proper thing to do in that situation, but it does not follow that the woman cannot lie in bed with her clothes on.  Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are not logically connected, and the premise does not entail the hypothesis.	133
1760523295	1760523299	Premise: That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort. Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all. But you will perhaps understand that there was a natural tendency on my part in asking what was after all a generous favour from my employer to hint that there was a good professional motive behind my request.  Hypothesis: there was a natural tendency on her part to hint that there was a good professional motive behind her request  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the speaker did not take sufficient account of Mr. Farraday's mood and preferences when bringing in the tea, and that the speaker was aware of Mr. Farraday's general propensity to talk in a bantering tone with them at such moments. This suggests that the speaker was aware of Mr. Farraday's personality and preferences, but did not take them into account when making the request.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that there was a natural tendency on the speaker's part to hint that there was a good professional motive behind their request. This implies that the speaker was aware of the potential professional implications of their request and was trying to downplay or justify it.  While the premise provides some background information about the speaker's relationship with Mr. Farraday and their awareness of his personality, it does not directly entail the hypothesis. The hypothesis is a separate statement that is being inferred based on the information provided in the premise.	239
1760523299	1760523302	Premise: But don't dilly-dally for too long. Once it's published we are all going to look a little risible if we have made no adjustments to what is after all known as being predominantly my own design of gallery. Also I am a bit older than the rest of you but you can perhaps understand that I don't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation.  Hypothesis: he doesn't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise sets the context and the tone for the speaker's concerns, while the hypothesis provides a specific reason or motivation for the speaker's actions.  The premise states that the speaker is anxious to publish their design of a gallery but doesn't want to delay too long, as they are aware that their work may look risible if they don't make any adjustments. This sets the stage for the speaker's desire to recant their work publicly before they die.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, provides a specific reason why the speaker wants to make a public recantation. The speaker is older and wants to ensure that they have a proper and public recantation before they pass away, which suggests that they are aware of their mortality and want to leave a lasting impression.  In other words, the premise establishes the speaker's urgency and motivation, while the hypothesis provides the specific reason why the speaker wants to act quickly.	216
1760523302	1760523305	Premise: I should dearly have liked to know whether they were Europeans or Americans, but I couldn't hear the accents. They appeared to be arguing. I hoped the white men weren't telling him to eliminate all witnesses because I don't believe it would have needed much persuasion.  Hypothesis: eliminating all witnesses would have needed much persuasion  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that the speaker was unable to determine whether the men were Europeans or Americans based on their accents, which suggests that they were not easily distinguishable based on their accents. This implies that the men were likely from a region or culture where their accents were not significantly different from those of Europeans or Americans, which in turn suggests that they were likely from a Western country.  The hypothesis then logically follows that if the men were from a Western country, it would have required a significant amount of persuasion to convince them to eliminate all witnesses. This is because Western cultures generally value the rule of law and the protection of human rights, and the idea of eliminating all witnesses to a crime would be seen as a serious violation of these values.  Therefore, the premise provides evidence that supports the hypothesis, as it suggests that the men were likely from a Western country where such actions would be seen as unacceptable.	210
1760523305	1760523308	Premise: But the damage was done as far as my faith was concerned, which is probably why I went mad. So anyway, that Christmas Eve night confirmed my worst fears, it was like a kind of ``royal flush'' for the infant Jimbo. All three kings - Pa Santa and the King of Kings - all down the pan together... And to be honest I don't believe any of them stands a chance of ever making a comeback with me.  Hypothesis: any of the three kings stands a chance of ever making a comeback with him  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the damage to the speaker's faith was already done, which suggests that their belief in the three kings (Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, and Jesus Christ) is no longer strong or valid. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that at least one of the three kings has a chance of making a comeback with the speaker. This is a contradictory idea, as the premise implies that the speaker's faith is irrevocably damaged.  Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are not logically connected, and the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.	148
1760523308	1760523311	Premise: He had seen something I should have, which was a car turning in from Soho Square and coming up behind me. My right foot hovered over the accelerator pedal and I balanced Armstrong on the clutch. I wasn't as convinced as Malpass that Nevil was out of harm's way.  Hypothesis: Nevil was out of harm's way  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the speaker saw a car turning into Soho Square and coming up behind them, which suggests that there is a potential danger or threat present. The speaker's right foot is hovering over the accelerator pedal and they are balancing Armstrong on the clutch, indicating that they are preparing to move their vehicle to avoid the danger.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Nevil is out of harm's way. This is a contradictory statement, as the premise suggests that there is a potential danger present. Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be entailed by the premise.  In other words, just because the speaker sees a car approaching from behind, it does not necessarily mean that Nevil is out of harm's way. The speaker may still be concerned for Nevil's safety, even if they are preparing to move their own vehicle to avoid the danger.	206
1760523311	1760523313	Premise: Jed wondered. He 'd scarcely set eyes on him since the night they 'd had dinner together at the house in Westwood. Nobody had mentioned him either and Jed didn't feel he should ask.  Hypothesis: Jed should ask  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise and hypothesis are not entailed by each other.  The premise states that Jed has not seen or heard much of the person since their dinner together, and nobody has mentioned him. This suggests that the person is not a central figure in Jed's life or in the lives of those around him.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that Jed should ask about the person. This implies that Jed has some curiosity or interest in the person, despite the fact that they have not been in touch.  Therefore, while the premise provides context for why Jed might not have asked about the person, the hypothesis suggests that Jed should take the initiative to do so, which is not necessarily implied by the premise.	156
1760523313	1760523316	Premise: Yet what good came from knowing that a woman had killed herself? The children who had suffered a trauma would survive the experience, scarred by it and a little flawed by it. They would never forget that for a week they had imagined the act of murder had been committed.  Hypothesis: for a week the children had imagined the act of murder had been committed  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"  No, the premise and hypothesis are not entailed by each other.  The premise states that ""a woman had killed herself,"" which implies that a person had taken their own life. However, the hypothesis states that ""the children had imagined the act of murder had been committed,"" which implies that the children had fantasized or pretended that someone had committed a murder, not that they had actually seen or experienced a suicide.  There is a significant difference between imagining a murder and imagining a suicide. While both scenarios may be disturbing or traumatic for children to think about, the nature of the act is different. Imagining a murder implies that the children are thinking about someone else taking a life, while imagining a suicide implies that the children are thinking about someone taking their own life.  Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are not entailed by each other, as they are addressing different scenarios."	198
1760523316	1760523318	Premise: Nora calculated that there must be lots of single men up there so she decided it was ideal for the ``manhunt'', as we called it, even though the train fare was a serious consideration. I remember we went up to Euston together one Saturday morning, very excited, to buy the ticket in advance. It was a secret - if my parents had known she was going away alone they would have soon put the kybosh on it.  Hypothesis: Nora was going away alone  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that Nora calculated that there must be lots of single men up there, which implies that she was going to meet single men at the location. This implies that she was going away alone, as she would not have been able to meet single men if she was going with a group of people.  Therefore, the premise logically leads to the conclusion that Nora was going away alone, which is the hypothesis.	101
1760523318	1760523320	Premise: His mother driving the car, so happy, young-looking and fashionably dressed and his father, a big, confident man in a smart suit, smiling and turning round to say something to Simon in the back seat. Marie thought of her own mother with her frumpy clothes and ageing, lined face. No one would have guessed that she was only forty-two.  Hypothesis: Marie's mother was only forty-two  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that Marie's mother is ""young-looking and fashionably dressed,"" which suggests that she is relatively young and stylish. The word ""fashionably"" implies that she is actively making an effort to look nice, which is consistent with the idea that she is in her 40s or younger.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Marie's mother is only 42 years old. This is a specific age that is consistent with the description provided in the premise, and it suggests that Marie's mother is indeed young and stylish.  Therefore, based on the information provided in the premise, it is reasonable to conclude that Marie's mother is only 42 years old."	168
1760523320	1760523322	Premise: ``I hope you are settling down and the cat is well.'' This was a lie. She did not hope the cat was well.  Hypothesis: the cat was well  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"  No, the premise ""I hope you are settling down and the cat is well"" does not entail the hypothesis ""the cat was well.""  The premise is a wish or an expression of hope, which is not necessarily connected to the cat's actual well-being. It is possible that the speaker does not actually care about the cat's well-being or that they are simply being polite.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as there is no logical connection between the two statements."	114
1760523322	1760523324	Premise: Jane ate without pausing. Hunger was an unknown experience. She had never imagined it could actually hurt.  Hypothesis: hunger could actually hurt  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that Jane ate without pausing, indicating that she was in a state of constant consumption without any breaks. This implies that she was not experiencing hunger or any discomfort related to food deprivation.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that hunger could actually hurt. This is a direct contradiction to the premise, as if hunger was not a known or experienced sensation for Jane. Therefore, the premise provides evidence to support the hypothesis, as it suggests that hunger is a new and unfamiliar experience for Jane.	133
1760523324	1760523328	Premise: Miss Martindale had had a school, but her rigid ideas and stern manner had frightened the children, and their parents had taken them away. And gradually the school declined, until she had to give it up and retire to end her days in the white cottage with the inevitable cat as her only companion. Breeze had never imagined that digging was such hard work.  Hypothesis: digging was such hard work  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that Miss Martindale's rigid ideas and stern manner had frightened the children and their parents, leading to the decline of her school. This implies that Miss Martindale's teaching methods were not effective or enjoyable for the children, which in turn suggests that digging (or learning) was hard work for them.  The hypothesis specifically states that digging was hard work for Breeze, which further supports the idea that Miss Martindale's teaching methods were not effective for the children. The contrast between the hard work of digging and the ease with which Breeze had imagined it suggests that Miss Martindale's teaching methods were not engaging or enjoyable for the children, and that they found it difficult to learn from her.  Therefore, the premise provides evidence to support the hypothesis that digging was hard work for Breeze and, by extension, for the children in Miss Martindale's school.	215
1760523328	1760523329	Premise: ``You don't need to worry. We're quite adequately chaperoned. Rosa is a woman of strict moral principles.'' If she knows I'm in here she's probably hovering outside the door right now.  Hypothesis: he's in here  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Rosa is a woman of strict moral principles, which implies that she is likely to be vigilant and watchful in her duties as a chaperone. However, it does not directly entail that she is currently hovering outside the door where the person is.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, implies that Rosa is inside the room with the person, which is a more specific and direct conclusion than what the premise entails. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.	122
1760523329	1760523332	Premise: I said you were mad to come over at this time. It's a world event. Don't you know that Venice is packed with visitors?  Hypothesis: Venice is packed with visitors  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the premise ""I said you were mad to come over at this time. It's a world event"" entails the hypothesis ""Venice is packed with visitors.""  Here's why:  Premise: ""I said you were mad to come over at this time. It's a world event.""  This premise suggests that there is some kind of event or situation that is causing a large number of people to be in Venice at the same time.  Hypothesis: ""Venice is packed with visitors.""  This hypothesis logically follows from the premise, as if there is a world event in Venice, it is likely that the city would be crowded with visitors. The premise provides a reason why Venice would be crowded, and the hypothesis provides a specific consequence of that reason.  Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis."	189
1760523332	1760523335	Premise: And what she had said, and went on saying quietly, calmly, efficiently, was that she loved Maggie. She paid attention. At eight Maggie had not known that her grandmother was famous but she had seen that people had something in their manner when they looked at Rachel.  Hypothesis: Maggie's grandmother was famous  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise only provides information about Rachel's behavior and Maggie's observation of it, without directly stating or implying that Rachel is famous. The hypothesis, on the other hand, makes a specific claim about Rachel's fame.  The premise states that Rachel said she loved Maggie and paid attention to her, and Maggie noticed that people had a certain demeanor when they looked at Rachel. This could be true of any person who is loved and respected by others, regardless of their fame.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the information provided in the premise does not directly support or imply the claim that Rachel is famous.	160
1760523335	1760523338	Premise: They 'd seen Miss Lavant on the promenade and about the town, always walking slowly, sometimes with a neat wicker basket. Kate had often thought she was beautiful. She hadn't known she was in love with Dr Greenslade who had a wife already and three children.  Hypothesis: Miss Lavant was in love with Dr Greenslade  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Kate had often thought Miss Lavant was beautiful and had wondered if she was in love with Dr. Greenslade. This implies that Kate had noticed Miss Lavant's presence in the town and had formed some sort of impression of her. The hypothesis then logically follows that Miss Lavant is in love with Dr. Greenslade, given the premise that Kate had thought her beautiful and had wondered about her feelings towards him.  The entailment is based on the fact that Kate's thoughts and observations about Miss Lavant's behavior and appearance provide evidence that Miss Lavant may have feelings for Dr. Greenslade. The premise sets the stage for the hypothesis by establishing that Kate had noticed Miss Lavant and had formed a positive impression of her, which makes it plausible that Miss Lavant may have feelings for Dr. Greenslade.	199
1760523338	1760523340	Premise: Did he intend everyone in the castle to know he did not want the wife he had married in such a hurry? Did he intend to ignore her completely? Then Isabel saw Ellen's stunned face and realised that her maid at least did not know she had spent the night alone.  Hypothesis: Isabel had spent the night alone  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Isabel did not want the wife she had married in such a hurry, which implies that she did not want to spend the night with her. This implies that Isabel intended to ignore her completely, which is consistent with the hypothesis that Isabel had spent the night alone.  Additionally, the fact that Isabel saw Ellen's stunned face and realized that her maid at least did not know she had spent the night alone further supports the hypothesis that Isabel had spent the night alone. This suggests that Isabel had made an effort to keep her solitary night a secret, which is consistent with the premise and the hypothesis.	144
1760523340	1760523342	Premise: Most of them young, about his age, stood and talked and drank and laughed. The two girls he had noticed earlier were standing talking to some other girls. Graham hoped they all realised that just because he was standing talking to Slater that didn't mean he was gay too.  Hypothesis: Graham was gay too  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise simply states that there are young people at the party, including two girls who are talking to other girls. It does not provide any information about Graham's sexual orientation.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that Graham is gay too, based on the fact that he is standing and talking to someone else at the party. However, there is no indication in the premise that Graham is gay, and it is possible that he is simply a friendly person who is socializing with others at the party.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.	134
1760523342	1760523346	Premise: He said that maybe I wasn't ready to join the Party just yet. Terry's passion for equality appealed to my purer mind, and his hatred of existing authority appealed to my resentments. But although I hated inequality it didn't mean I wanted to be treated like everyone else.  Hypothesis: he wanted to be treated like everyone else  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Terry's passion for equality appealed to the speaker's purer mind, and his hatred of existing authority appealed to their resentments. However, the hypothesis states that the speaker wanted to be treated like everyone else. These two statements are not necessarily related, as the speaker may appreciate Terry's ideals but still want to be treated differently from others.  For example, the speaker may believe in equality and want to be treated fairly, but also want to be recognized or respected for their unique talents or abilities that set them apart from others. In this case, they may not want to be treated like everyone else, but rather want to be valued and recognized as an individual.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the speaker's desires and motivations may be complex and multi-faceted, and cannot be inferred solely based on their appreciation for Terry's ideals.	217
1760523346	1760523348	Premise: ``Oh, my poor Folly... We 've been together for five years, Lexy and I - she practically holds that company together. Of course I gave her an ``A''. But that doesn't mean I'm having an affair with her.  Hypothesis: he is having an affair with Lexy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the speaker has been together with Folly for five years and that Folly practically holds the company together. This suggests that the speaker has a close and important relationship with Folly, which could potentially be romantic or platonic. However, the premise does not provide any evidence to suggest that the speaker is having an affair with Lexy.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, implies that the speaker is having an affair with Lexy, which is a different person than Folly. The hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise, as there is no direct evidence or indication in the premise that the speaker is involved in an affair with Lexy.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.	170
1760523348	1760523351	Premise: Nevertheless, her heart sank at the thought of spending an evening with him in his present state of mind, and she was tempted to invent a sore throat in order to get out of it. But he had been very helpful over the Puddephat business, she admitted to herself, and his moods were unpredictable - he might be on top of the world by the time he arrived at the cinema. ``I'm still keen if you are '' she said brightly pretending she had not noticed anything was amiss.  Hypothesis: something was amiss  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that the woman's heart sank at the thought of spending an evening with the man in his present state of mind, which suggests that something is bothering her about his current mental state. This implies that there is something amiss, which is further confirmed by the hypothesis that something is amiss.  The premise provides evidence for the hypothesis by indicating that the woman is aware of something being wrong with the man's mental state, and is hesitant to spend time with him because of it. This suggests that she has observed changes in his behavior or mood that are cause for concern, and that she is trying to avoid an uncomfortable or difficult evening.  Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis by providing evidence that supports the idea that something is amiss with the man's mental state, and that the woman is aware of it.	195
1760523351	1760523353	Premise: What must it be like to be imprisoned here, day after day, month after month? I wonder, does he keep them chained and manacled, thought Fenella, or does he use sorcery? And so utterly immersed was she in this strange blue and green land that was not feeling strange any more that she did not even notice that she was weighing sorcery against steel chains and seriously considering the likely outcome.  Hypothesis: Fenella was weighing sorcery against steel chains  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Fenella is wondering about the conditions of the prisoners in the strange blue and green land, and is speculating about whether they are kept chained and manacled or if the wizard uses sorcery to imprison them. The hypothesis, on the other hand, specifically states that Fenella is weighing sorcery against steel chains, indicating that she is considering the possibility that the wizard may be using sorcery to imprison the prisoners rather than physical chains.  Therefore, the premise provides a context for the hypothesis to be true, and the hypothesis logically follows from the premise.	144
1760523353	1760523357	Premise: Strasbourg, Vienna, Bucharest, Istanbul, not stopping, not looking back. I saw her tossing newly gauffred curls as the open roadster headed east, away from Ollie... Temporarily I managed to re-erect my jocular facade, but inside I was panicking. He could take her away I thought he could just do that he has such power to hurt me this little furry creature who hasn't even noticed that I 've given up the weed.  Hypothesis: he has given up the weed  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise provides a scenario where the speaker is on a journey with a woman who has newly-grown curls, and the speaker is feeling panicked because they fear the man they are with (Ollie) could take her away. This implies that the speaker has a close relationship with the woman, and is invested in her well-being.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the man (Ollie) has given up something that is important to the speaker, specifically the weed. This is supported by the fact that the speaker is panicking at the thought of Ollie taking the woman away, which suggests that they value their relationship with her and are afraid of losing her.  Therefore, the premise provides context for the hypothesis, which explains why the speaker is feeling panicked and anxious about Ollie's potential actions.	199
1760523357	1760523360	Premise: It - the tractor, the boys and the bulbs in the earth - knew she had chosen for them and was coming back to them. Of course there was still love, there was healthy, growing love and its name was called Work. She had fallen in love with it so slowly and gently and sweetly that she had never noticed it had happened.  Hypothesis: falling in love had happened  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"  No, the premise and hypothesis are not entailed by each other.  The premise states that ""It - the tractor, the boys and the bulbs in the earth - knew she had chosen for them and was coming back to them. Of course there was still love, there was healthy, growing love and its name was called Work."" This implies that the subject of the sentence (the tractor, boys, and bulbs) are aware of and looking forward to the return of someone or something called ""Work.""  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that ""Falling in love had happened."" This is a statement about the past tense of the verb ""love,"" and does not logically follow from the premise. The premise does not provide any information about the protagonist's emotional state or whether they have fallen in love with anything.  Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are not entailed by each other."	201
1760523360	1760523362	Premise: After the twelfth dot, two thirds of the way down the page, the transcript of this long session tails away into blank paper. I suppose what's happened is this. He has gone on staring out of the window thinking and she has gone on staring at him waiting with such absorption that neither of them noticed the tape had run out.  Hypothesis: the tape had run out  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that ""two thirds of the way down the page, the transcript of this long session tails away into blank paper."" This implies that the tape has run out, as there is a gap in the transcript where the tape should continue but does not.  Without any additional information, it is reasonable to assume that the tape ran out while the speaker was still talking, and the transcriber was unable to continue recording. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the tape had run out."	121
1760523362	1760523363	Premise: ``His name is Matthew Blake,'' Mandy informed Charity as they descended the steps from their cabin on to the paved pathway that led to the lodge. Thankfully she hadn't even noticed that Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt and was now wearing red shorts with her white silk blouse.  Hypothesis: Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise simply states that Matthew Blake's name is Matthew Blake, which does not provide any information about Charity's clothing. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt to red shorts, which is not mentioned in the premise.  Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are not logically connected, and the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.	108
1760523363	1760523366	Premise: ``These ` ere smugglers is a dangerous bunch from wot I 've ` eard!'' ``If only we could devise a safe way of laying our hands on all that money,'' murmured Pugwash, whose greed was as proverbial as his cowardice. And the pirates were so busy discussing the problem and what they would do with the reward if they won it that they didn't notice that they were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage.  Hypothesis: the pirates were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise provides a setting and establishes the characters involved in the situation, including Pugwash and the pirates. It also mentions that the pirates are discussing their plan to steal the treasure and that they are unaware of being observed.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, explicitly states that the pirates are being observed from the window above by the new Mayor and his entourage. This is a logical consequence of the premise, as the new Mayor and his entourage are established to be present in the building where the pirates are gathered, and the premise provides the opportunity for them to observe the pirates' conversation.  Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis by providing the necessary conditions for the observation to occur.	171
1760523366	1760523368	Premise: Ockleton, Morpurgo, Cornelius, Dysart and half a dozen others too drunk to mention. But there was so much coming and going that any one of us could have slipped out, pushed Everett through the window and slipped back again without being noticed. Damn it all we didn't even notice Everett was missing until a porter tripped over him in the quad so anything's theoretically possible.  Hypothesis: Everett was missing  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states that a group of people, including Ockleton, Morpurgo, Cornelius, Dysart, and several others, were drunk and there was a lot of coming and going in the building. This creates a scenario where it is possible for anyone in the group to have slipped out, pushed Everett through the window, and slipped back again without being noticed.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Everett was missing. Given the premise, it is possible that Everett could have been pushed through the window and disappeared without anyone noticing, especially given the state of intoxication of the group. Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis.	163
1760523368	1760523371	Premise: His hair was white, as my daughters reported when they went to view the body before it was given to the Odonata. Now he is known as The Man Who Changed the World, and there are statues to him everywhere. No one remembers he had a younger brother.  Hypothesis: The Man Who Changed the World had a younger brother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise simply states that the Man Who Changed the World had white hair, while the hypothesis states that he had a younger brother. These are two different pieces of information, and the premise does not provide any logical connection between the two.  The premise and hypothesis are independent of each other, and they do not logically entail or imply each other. The premise provides a factual description of the Man Who Changed the World's appearance, while the hypothesis proposes a new piece of information about his personal life.  Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are not logically connected, and they cannot be used to draw a conclusion that the Man Who Changed the World had a younger brother.	160
1760523371	1760523372	Premise: Oh, I did, I did! I was lucky. I would have liked brothers and sisters but I don't remember that I was ever lonely.  Hypothesis: she was ever lonely  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the person was lucky and did not feel lonely, which contradicts the hypothesis that they were ever lonely. The premise and hypothesis are mutually exclusive, so they cannot be logically connected.  Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are not entailed by each other.	79
1760523372	1760523374	Premise: Her priggishness. I admire it. I know she does wrong things she tries to organize other people's lives she can't see Mr Knightley is a man in a million.  Hypothesis: Mr Knightley is a man in a million  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the protagonist admires the antagonist's ""priggishness,"" which implies that the protagonist sees something admirable or impressive in the antagonist's behavior. However, the hypothesis states that Mr. Knightley is a man in a million, which implies that the protagonist has a positive view of him. These two statements are not necessarily connected, as the protagonist may admire the antagonist's behavior without necessarily thinking that Mr. Knightley is a good person.  Therefore, the premise and the hypothesis are not entailed by each other."	143
1760523374	1760523377	Premise: Only she herself knew the evil thoughts she had and how effortlessly they could be translated into action. ``I 'll make a cup of tea.'' No she would not tell Peter that the person he loved most in the world was dead.  Hypothesis: the person Peter loved most in the world was dead  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise and hypothesis do not entail each other.  The premise states that only she herself knew the evil thoughts she had, and how effortlessly they could be translated into action. This suggests that the character has the ability to keep her evil thoughts and intentions hidden from others, including Peter.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the person Peter loved most in the world was dead. This is a statement that is independent of the character's thoughts or actions, and does not necessarily imply that she is aware of Peter's feelings or that she has any intention of harming him.  Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are not entailed by each other, as they are unrelated statements that do not logically follow from each other.	162
1760523377	1760523380	Premise: ``It's not your day, is it, dear?'' ``No, but they 've got to be done, and Shirley's making the tea.'' Ianthe had not told her mother that she sometimes had to dust the books in the library.  Hypothesis: Ianthe sometimes had to dust the books in the library  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise ""It's not your day, is it, dear?"" implies that something is not going well for Ianthe, and the second part of the sentence ""No, but they 've got to be done, and Shirley's making the tea."" suggests that there are tasks that need to be done despite the bad luck.  The mention of Shirley making tea suggests that the context is a domestic one, and the phrase ""and Shirley's making the tea"" implies that Shirley is taking care of some practical task.  The mention of dusting the books in the library in the context of Ianthe having a bad day and Shirley making tea implies that Ianthe is responsible for dusting the books in the library, and that it is something she does regularly, or at least occasionally, despite it not being her day.  Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis that Ianthe sometimes has to dust the books in the library."	219
1760523380	1760523383	Premise: He pulled occasionally, his arms tiring. Conker slowed a little, but the branches were coming too fast, he had to lean right forward and couldn't use his hands. He remembered the gate at the end of the track had time to hope it was open because he didn't think Conker could jump it.  Hypothesis: Conker could jump the gate  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that Conker slowed a little, but the branches were coming too fast, and the protagonist had to lean right forward and couldn't use his hands. This implies that Conker is moving at a significant speed and is unable to stop or slow down on its own.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Conker could jump the gate at the end of the track. Given the situation described in the premise, it is unlikely that Conker would be able to jump the gate, especially since the protagonist doesn't think it can. Therefore, the hypothesis is a logical conclusion based on the information provided in the premise.	150
1760523383	1760523385	Premise: But he ended up eating it himself. I was reluctant to kiss my mother, afraid that somehow her weakness and unhappiness would infect me. Naturally I didn't think for a minute that my life and spirit could stimulate her.  Hypothesis: her life and spirit could stimulate her mother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise and hypothesis are not entailed by each other.  The premise states that the speaker was reluctant to kiss their mother because they were afraid of absorbing her weakness and unhappiness. This suggests that the speaker sees their mother as a source of negativity or weakness, rather than a source of strength or happiness.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the speaker's life and spirit could stimulate their mother. This implies that the speaker believes their own life and energy could have a positive impact on their mother, rather than a negative one.  Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are not logically connected, and one cannot be inferred from the other.	151
1760523385	1760523387	Premise: ``Ely,'' I said (that was her name and the first time I 'd ever used it), ``I want to be free.'' She looked stunned. I don't think she 'd considered this.  Hypothesis: Ely had considered him wanting to be free  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Ely looked stunned when the speaker said ""I want to be free,"" which suggests that she had not considered this desire before. However, the hypothesis implies that Ely had indeed considered the speaker's desire to be free, which is a different idea.  The premise only provides evidence that Ely was surprised by the speaker's request, but it does not necessarily imply that she had previously thought about or considered the desire to be free. Therefore, the two statements are not logically connected, and the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise."	136
1760523387	1760523390	Premise: I'm sorry, I 've put you in an invidious position. If you're being run by Morton, he 'll want to hear all this. It won't do any harm but I 'd rather not give him food for thought because I consider him an idiot and I don't think he's capable of interpreting it correctly.  Hypothesis: Morton is capable of interpreting this food for thought correctly  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the speaker is in an invidious position and that Morton, the person they are speaking to, will want to hear the information. However, this does not necessarily mean that Morton is capable of interpreting the information correctly. The speaker may have a low opinion of Morton's intelligence or cognitive abilities, which does not necessarily imply that Morton is incapable of interpreting the information accurately.  In order for the premise to entail the hypothesis, there would need to be additional information or context that suggests Morton is indeed incapable of interpreting the information correctly. For example, if the speaker provides further details about Morton's intellectual abilities or if they have previous experiences with Morton that suggest he is not capable of understanding complex ideas, then the premise could entail the hypothesis. However, based solely on the information provided in the passage, it is not possible to conclude that the premise entails the hypothesis.	219
1760523390	1760523392	Premise: The big Norwegian shook his head, frowning. ``Jeg fonstAr ikke.'' I don't think he found Ward's accent at all easy and anyway like many foreigners he found it easier to speak English than to understand it.  Hypothesis: the big Norwegian found Ward's accent at all easy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the big Norwegian shook his head and frowned, indicating that he did not find Ward's accent easy to understand. This is a negative statement, which means that the big Norwegian did not find Ward's accent easy.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the big Norwegian found Ward's accent easy. This is a positive statement, which means that the opposite of what the premise states.  Therefore, the premise and the hypothesis are mutually exclusive, and the premise does not entail the hypothesis.	133
1760523392	1760523395	Premise: You really don't know anything about me, do you, despite all that wallowing in my mind? As it happens I don't think I'm the right person to lead humanity into the future no.  Hypothesis: she is the right person to lead humanity into the future  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the speaker does not know anything about the person they are addressing, suggesting that they have no personal information or knowledge about them. This implies that the speaker cannot make any claims about the person's abilities or qualifications to lead humanity into the future.  On the other hand, the hypothesis states that the person is the right person to lead humanity into the future. This is a bold and definitive statement that implies the speaker has confidence in the person's abilities and qualifications to lead humanity.  Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are logically independent of each other, and the premise does not entail the hypothesis.	153
1760523395	1760523397	Premise: It's where the bands practise. I can't remember what band Petra's in, but I seen them practise once. They were OK but I didn't think they was brilliant.  Hypothesis: Petra's band was brilliant  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Petra's band practises at a certain location, but it does not provide any information about the quality of their music. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Petra's band is brilliant, which is a subjective evaluation that cannot be inferred from the premise.  The premise provides only factual information about the location where Petra's band practices, while the hypothesis makes a positive evaluation about the band's quality. These two statements are not logically connected, and the premise does not entail the hypothesis.	134
1760523397	1760523400	Premise: She swallowed hard, unsure if she had the nerve to go ahead. The memory of the pain in Tara's eyes last night decided her. Did he really expect her to believe that Tara was only the housekeeper?  Hypothesis: Tara was only the housekeeper  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that the protagonist is unsure if she has the nerve to go ahead, suggesting that there is something she needs to do or say. The hypothesis, on the other hand, provides a possible explanation for the situation, which is that Tara was only the housekeeper. The premise and hypothesis are logically connected because the protagonist's uncertainty is based on the possibility that Tara was more than just a housekeeper, and the hypothesis provides a plausible reason for why Tara might have been in the room with the protagonist and Tara last night.  In other words, the premise sets up the situation and the protagonist's uncertainty, while the hypothesis provides a possible explanation for what might have happened. The two are connected because the protagonist's uncertainty is based on the possibility that Tara was more than just a housekeeper, and the hypothesis provides a plausible reason for why that might be the case.	211
1760523400	1760523403	Premise: If there are spirits at work at the time, they come only from yourself, not from the fume of the incense. Why should spirits aid living beings? What arrogance is it that drives people to believe they can have power over them?  Hypothesis: people can have power over spirits  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise states that spirits come only from within oneself, rather than from the fumes of incense, which suggests that spirits are an internal phenomenon rather than something that can be controlled or manipulated through external means. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that people can have power over spirits, which is the opposite of what the premise implies.  The premise and hypothesis are mutually exclusive, as the premise undermines the hypothesis. If spirits come from within oneself, then it is unlikely that people can have power over them, as they are not external entities that can be controlled or manipulated. Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are not logically connected, and the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.	168
1760523403	1760523409	Premise: Why should this topic matter? You talked about everything else as you usually do. Why should I feel Maelmuire is important?  Hypothesis: Maelmuire is important  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Thank you for asking! The topic of Maelmuire is indeed an important one, and here's why:  Premise: Maelmuire is a fascinating and unique figure in Irish mythology, with a rich history and cultural significance. He is often overlooked or underappreciated in modern discussions of Irish mythology, but his story has valuable insights into the beliefs and values of ancient Irish society.  Hypothesis: Maelmuire's story highlights the importance of hospitality, generosity, and the power of storytelling in Irish culture. By examining his tale, we can gain a deeper understanding of the cultural norms and values of ancient Ireland, and how they continue to influence modern Irish society.  The premise and hypothesis are connected in several ways:  1. Cultural significance: Maelmuire's story is significant to Irish culture because of his association with the Tuatha Dé Danann, a group of supernatural beings in Irish mythology. By exploring his story, we can gain insight into the beliefs and values of this important group of characters. 2. Hospitality and generosity: Maelmuire's actions as a host and giver of gifts are central to his story. By examining these acts of hospitality and generosity, we can learn more about the cultural importance of these values in ancient Ireland. 3. Storytelling: Maelmuire's story is passed down through generations, highlighting the importance of storytelling in Irish culture. By studying his tale, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the power of storytelling in shaping cultural norms and values.  In conclusion, the premise and hypothesis are connected in that they both highlight the cultural significance of Maelmuire's story in Irish mythology. By examining his tale, we can gain a deeper understanding of the beliefs and values of ancient Ireland and how they continue to influence modern Irish society.	423
1760523409	1760523413	Premise: It is all very well, in these changing times, to adapt one's work to take in duties not traditionally within one's realm. But bantering is of another dimension altogether. For one thing how would one know for sure that at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected?  Hypothesis: at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that it is understandable in today's changing times to adapt one's work to take on duties not traditionally within one's realm. This suggests that in a fluid and evolving environment, it is reasonable to adjust one's work to accommodate new responsibilities.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that at any given moment, a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected. This implies that in any given situation, a bantering response is the appropriate or expected response, without considering the context or circumstances of the situation.  While the premise may provide a general basis for adaptability and flexibility, it does not necessarily entail that a bantering response is always the correct or expected response in any given situation. In fact, the premise suggests the opposite, as it acknowledges that the environment is changing and that traditional boundaries may no longer apply. Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically deduced from the premise.	222
1760523413	1760523415	Premise: But the horror of losing was as much to do with money as with pride. Biddy had never let them down, come without fail all through the bad weather, and now was giving Nails an intensive course on her own horse which - in terms of money - was worth another couple of hundred pounds. Yet surely she knew they had no way of paying should she demand it?  Hypothesis: they had no way of paying  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that the loss of the horse race was as much due to the financial burden of paying for Biddy's course as it was to do with pride. This implies that Biddy's course is expensive, and that Nails and his friends cannot afford to pay for it. The hypothesis logically follows from this premise, stating that they have no way of paying for the course, given their financial situation.  In other words, the premise provides the context and motivation for the hypothesis, which is a logical conclusion based on the information provided in the premise.	138
1760523415	1760523418	Premise: I ducked so fast I wasn't sure whether he 'd seen me or not, but it gave me a prickly feeling just to imagine it, so I scuttled for the door and legged it up the spiral stairway three steps at a time, just in case. As I ran, I remember thinking stupid thoughts like. How did he know I was up here looking down?  Hypothesis: he was up there looking down  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the protagonist ducked so fast that they weren't sure if the person (presumably the one who was looking down) had seen them. This implies that the protagonist is trying to hide or avoid being seen, which suggests that they are in a situation where they do not want to be detected.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the person who was looking down knew the protagonist was up there. This is a separate statement that is not necessarily implied by the premise. It is possible that the person looking down had no idea the protagonist was there, or that they were simply unaware of the protagonist's presence.  Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are not logically connected, and the premise does not entail the hypothesis.	182
1760523418	1760523421	Premise: At the heart of the universe there is cruelty. We are predators and are preyed upon, every living thing. Did you know that wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds piercing the weak spot in their armour?  Hypothesis: wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that ""at the heart of the universe there is cruelty,"" which suggests that there is a natural and universal aspect of predation and prey in the world. This implies that all living things, including wasps and ladybirds, engage in predation and are preyed upon to some extent.  The hypothesis, ""wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds,"" is a specific example of this broader predator-prey dynamic, where wasps are the predators and ladybirds are the prey. This hypothesis is logically entailed by the premise because it is a specific instance of the more general predator-prey relationship.  In other words, the premise provides the general context for the hypothesis, which is a specific example of how the predator-prey dynamic operates in the natural world. The premise sets the stage for the hypothesis by establishing the idea that predation and prey are fundamental aspects of the universe, and the hypothesis fills in the details by providing a specific example of this dynamic."	235
1760523421	1760523424	Premise: ``I wanted to tell you. But the Bookman asked me to keep our meeting a secret.'' How did you know I 'd met him?  Hypothesis: he had met the Bookman  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis. Here's why:  Premise: ""I wanted to tell you. But the Bookman asked me to keep our meeting a secret.""  The premise suggests that the speaker had a meeting with someone, who they want to tell the listener about, but are unable to do so due to a request made by the other person.  Hypothesis: ""He had met the Bookman.""  This hypothesis explains why the speaker is unable to tell the listener about the meeting. If the speaker had met the Bookman, it is likely that the Bookman asked them to keep the meeting a secret, which would explain why the speaker is unable to reveal the information.  Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis, as the hypothesis provides a possible explanation for why the speaker is unable to tell the listener about the meeting."	182
1760523424	1760523427	Premise: She rubbed them away with an angry fist. She was a fool to let anyone get round her. How long before she learned that folk 'll always take advantage of weakness?  Hypothesis: folk 'll always take advantage of weakness  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that the protagonist rubbed away her tears with an angry fist, indicating that she is feeling vulnerable and weak. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that people will always take advantage of weakness.  The premise and hypothesis are logically connected because the protagonist's weakness (as demonstrated by her tears) has led to her vulnerability to being taken advantage of. The fact that she is struggling to cope with her emotions and is feeling angry and defensive suggests that she is in a position of weakness, which makes her more susceptible to being exploited or taken advantage of.  Therefore, the premise provides evidence to support the hypothesis, as it suggests that the protagonist's weakness has led to her being taken advantage of by others.	179
1760523427	1760523430	Premise: At length she decided that there was nothing to be gained by worrying her. Probably there was some quite innocent explanation, which Roger Kenyon would give her when she returned the wallet - if, indeed, it were his. And yet why had his manner changed so abruptly when he learned that the girl whose hat he had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage?  Hypothesis: the girl whose hat Roger Kenyon had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that there is nothing to be gained by worrying about the lost wallet, and that probably there is an innocent explanation for its disappearance. It does not logically follow that the person who found the wallet is the one who will live at Sunset Cottage.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a specific conclusion that is drawn from the premise. It suggests that the girl whose hat Roger Kenyon rescued is indeed going to live at Sunset Cottage, which is a logical extension of the premise.  In other words, the premise provides a general reasoning for why the protagonist should not worry about the lost wallet, while the hypothesis provides a specific detail about the identity of the person who will be living at Sunset Cottage.	183
1760523430	1760523432	Premise: Anna looked at Peter again and said to herself in a guilty whisper, ``Will he become even more difficult?'' She wondered if a stranger could tell that he was difficult, just by looking at him. Would such a person watching Peter now reading the prayers of Rite B in his level pleasant voice notice that resentment lay like his blood just under his skin because the life he had chosen had not turned out as he had expected it to?  Hypothesis: resentment lay just under Peter's skin  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that Anna looked at Peter and wondered if a stranger could tell that he was difficult just by looking at him. This implies that Anna is aware of Peter's difficult nature and is concerned that others may be able to perceive it as well.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that resentment lies just under Peter's skin. This is a direct consequence of the premise, as if a stranger were to look at Peter, they may be able to sense the resentment that Anna has described. The premise provides the context and motivation for the hypothesis, making it a logical conclusion.  Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis, as the latter is a direct result of the former.	165
1760523432	1760523435	Premise: Jean was tough and liked to drink. She would endure for a long while yet. But what would she do when she realized that with things as they were she was on a life sentence not just a temporary suspension of essential pleasure?  Hypothesis: Jean was on a life sentence  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states that Jean was tough and liked to drink, implying that she enjoys indulging in these activities and finds them pleasurable. However, the premise also states that Jean realized that with things as they were, she was on a life sentence, not just a temporary suspension of essential pleasure. This implies that Jean's enjoyment of drinking and toughness is not a temporary state, but rather a permanent aspect of her life.  Therefore, the hypothesis that Jean is on a life sentence is a logical conclusion based on the premise. The premise provides evidence that Jean is someone who enjoys drinking and being tough, and the hypothesis explains the implications of this behavior in light of the information provided in the premise.	176
1760523435	1760523436	Premise: ``Clever''. Klug means ``clever''. Would you say that Abie was clever?  Hypothesis: Abie was clever  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the premise ""Clever' implies that Abie was clever. Here's why:  The word ""clever"" is a synonym for ""klug,"" which is the word used in the premise. Therefore, if the premise is true, it means that Abie isklug, which in turn means that Abie is clever.  So, the premise directly entails the hypothesis, as the two words have the same meaning."	99
1760523436	1760523439	Premise: The Susweca. It means ``dragonfly'' in Sioux, you know. Did I ever tell you that's where Paul and I met?  Hypothesis: Susweca is where she and Paul met  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise ""The Susweca. It means 'dragonfly' in Sioux, you know. Did I ever tell you that's where Paul and I met?"" is simply providing information about the name Susweca and its meaning in Sioux language. It does not directly imply or entail that Paul and the speaker met at Susweca.  The hypothesis ""Susweca is where she and Paul met"" is a separate statement that is being suggested or proposed based on the premise. It is not a logical consequence or implication of the premise alone.  Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are separate and distinct statements, and the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	160
1760523439	1760523442	Premise: How do you know? she was going to ask, but his smile was answer enough. If DeVore said there was going to be a vacancy there would be a vacancy.  Hypothesis: there was going to be a vacancy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states ""If DeVore said there was going to be a vacancy, there would be a vacancy."" This is a causal statement, indicating that DeVore's statement is the cause of the vacancy. The hypothesis, ""There was going to be a vacancy,"" is the logical conclusion or effect of the premise.  In other words, the premise sets up a cause-and-effect relationship between DeVore's statement and the existence of a vacancy. Therefore, if DeVore said there would be a vacancy, it is logically implied that there will indeed be a vacancy.  So, the premise entails the hypothesis, meaning that the statement of the hypothesis follows necessarily from the premise."	172
1760523442	1760523444	Premise: She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked. Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit, then came out and was not very successful in finding a job to suit him. That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them.  Hypothesis: it was Edward's fault  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	  No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise simply states that the couple, Nenna and Edward, did not give themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married, which could potentially be a factor in their current situation. The hypothesis, on the other hand, explicitly states that it was Edward's fault that he was not successful in finding a job.  The premise and hypothesis are not logically connected, as the premise provides a general observation about the couple's decision-making process without assigning blame, while the hypothesis points fingers at Edward as the sole cause of his job search failure. The premise does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support the hypothesis, so it cannot be inferred that Edward's fault was the most likely explanation for his job search outcome.	169
