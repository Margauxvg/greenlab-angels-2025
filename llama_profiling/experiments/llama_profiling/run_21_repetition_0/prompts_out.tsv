1760598603	1760598604	Premise: No Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq Yet.  Hypothesis: Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This is a classic example of a syllogism with a fallacy.  The premise states that "No Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq Yet." This is a declarative statement that asserts a fact about Iraq.  The hypothesis states that "Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq." This is also a declarative statement that asserts a fact about Iraq.  However, the two statements are not equivalent, and the premise does not necessarily imply the hypothesis. The premise simply states that no weapons of mass destruction have been found in Iraq, whereas the hypothesis is a claim that these weapons have been found.  In other words, the premise is a negative statement, and the hypothesis is a positive statement. This is a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent, which is a type of syllogism.  To follow the correct logical structure, the hypothesis should be a negation of the premise, not a confirmation. The corrected hypothesis should be "No Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq Yet" (or something similar).  For example:  Premise: No Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq Yet.  Hypothesis: None of the statements made in the premise are true.
1760598604	1760598604	Premise: A place of sorrow, after Pope John Paul II died, became a place of celebration, as Roman Catholic faithful gathered in downtown Chicago to mark the installation of new Pope Benedict XVI.  Hypothesis: Pope Benedict XVI is the new leader of the Roman Catholic Church.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that after Pope John Paul II died, the place became a place of celebration, as Roman Catholic faithful gathered in downtown Chicago to mark the installation of a new Pope. This suggests that the new Pope was John Paul II, not Benedict XVI.  The hypothesis incorrectly assumes that the new Pope is Benedict XVI, without providing any evidence or logical connection between the two. In other words, there is no logical link between the premise and the hypothesis that the new Pope is Benedict XVI. The premise simply states that the event occurred after John Paul II's death, without providing any information about the new Pope.  A correct hypothesis would need to provide a logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis, such as: "The new Pope is Benedict XVI because the Catholic Church chose Benedict XVI as the new Pope after the death of Pope John Paul II."
1760598604	1760598605	Premise: Herceptin was already approved to treat the sickest breast cancer patients, and the company said, Monday, it will discuss with federal regulators the possibility of prescribing the drug for more breast cancer patients.  Hypothesis: Herceptin can be used to treat breast cancer.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Herceptin was already approved to treat the sickest breast cancer patients, but it does not provide any information about the effectiveness of Herceptin for other patients. The premise only mentions that the drug is already approved for the sickest patients, without specifying its efficacy for other patients.  Therefore, the hypothesis that Herceptin can be used to treat breast cancer patients does not logically follow from the premise.
1760598605	1760598605	Premise: Judie Vivian, chief executive at ProMedica, a medical service company that helps sustain the 2-year-old Vietnam Heart Institute in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), said that so far about 1,500 children have received treatment.  Hypothesis: The previous name of Ho Chi Minh City was Saigon.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Judie Vivian is the chief executive at ProMedica, a medical service company that helps sustain the 2-year-old Vietnam Heart Institute in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon).   The hypothesis states that about 1,500 children have received treatment. However, the premise does not provide any information about the number of children who received treatment, so we cannot assume that the number 1,500 is correct.  Therefore, the hypothesis is not supported by the premise.
1760598605	1760598606	Premise: A man is due in court later charged with the murder 26 years ago of a teenager whose case was the first to be featured on BBC One's Crimewatch. Colette Aram, 16, was walking to her boyfriend's house in Keyworth, Nottinghamshire, on 30 October 1983 when she disappeared. Her body was later found in a field close to her home. Paul Stewart Hutchinson, 50, has been charged with murder and is due before Nottingham magistrates later.  Hypothesis: Paul Stewart Hutchinson is accused of having stabbed a girl.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Colette Aram was 16 years old when she was murdered, but it does not imply that she was stabbed. The premise mentions that her body was found in a field, but it does not specify the method of death. Therefore, it is not possible to make a hypothesis based on this information.  To make a hypothesis, we would need more information, such as the cause of death, the method of death, or any other relevant details. Without this information, it is impossible to draw a conclusion about Paul Stewart Hutchinson's guilt.
1760598606	1760598606	Premise: Britain said, Friday, that it has barred cleric, Omar Bakri, from returning to the country from Lebanon, where he was released by police after being detained for 24 hours.  Hypothesis: Bakri was briefly detained, but was released.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Britain has barred cleric Omar Bakri from returning to the country, but it does not provide any information about what actually happened to Bakri in Lebanon or why he was detained. There is no indication that Bakri was detained, let alone released. The premise only mentions that he was released, but it does not establish any connection between this event and his current situation in Britain.  Therefore, the hypothesis is unfounded and does not logically follow from the premise.
1760598606	1760598606	Premise: Nearly 4 million children who have at least one parent who entered the U.S. illegally were born in the United States and are U.S. citizens as a result, according to the study conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center. That's about three quarters of the estimated 5.5 million children of illegal immigrants inside the United States, according to the study. About 1.8 million children of undocumented immigrants live in poverty, the study found.  Hypothesis: Three quarters of U.S. illegal immigrants have children.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that nearly 4 million children who have at least one parent who entered the U.S. illegally were born in the United States and are U.S. citizens, but it does not imply that three quarters of U.S. illegal immigrants have children.  The premise only addresses the number of U.S. citizens born to parents who are in the U.S. illegally, and does not provide information about the relationship between U.S. citizenship and the presence of children born to illegal immigrants. It does not establish a causal relationship between the two.  Therefore, the hypothesis that three quarters of U.S. illegal immigrants have children does not follow from the premise.
1760598606	1760598607	Premise: Like the United States, U.N. officials are also dismayed that Aristide killed a conference called by Prime Minister Robert Malval in Port-au-Prince in hopes of bringing all the feuding parties together.  Hypothesis: Aristide had Prime Minister Robert Malval  murdered in Port-au-Prince.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This hypothesis follows from the premise.  To determine if the hypothesis is true, we need to evaluate the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.  The premise states that Aristide killed a conference called by Prime Minister Robert Malval in Port-au-Prince, in an attempt to bring all feuding parties together.   Given this, the hypothesis is that Aristide had Prime Minister Robert Malval murdered. This conclusion logically follows from the premise because the premise describes the event (Aristide killing the conference) and the action (Aristide's murder of Prime Minister Malval).
1760598607	1760598607	Premise: WASHINGTON --  A newly declassified narrative of the Bush administration's advice to the CIA on harsh interrogations shows that the small group of Justice Department lawyers who wrote memos authorizing controversial interrogation techniques were operating not on their own but with direction from top administration officials, including then-Vice President Dick Cheney and national security adviser Condoleezza Rice. At the same time, the narrative suggests that then-Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and then-Secretary of State Colin Powell were largely left out of the decision-making process.  Hypothesis: Dick Cheney was the Vice President of Bush.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Bush administration's advice to the CIA on harsh interrogation techniques was based on the work of a small group of Justice Department lawyers, including those who wrote memos authorizing the techniques. However, the premise does not imply that the Justice Department lawyers were operating independently of the administration's top officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, and then-Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld.  In fact, the premise suggests that the Justice Department lawyers were operating with direction from top administration officials, which means that the hypothesis would require additional information to support the claim that Dick Cheney was the Vice President. Without this information, the hypothesis is unfounded.
1760598607	1760598608	Premise: Only a week after it had no comment on upping the storage capacity of its Hotmail e-mail service, Microsoft early Thursday announced it was boosting the allowance to 250MB to follow similar moves by rivals such as Google, Yahoo, and Lycos.  Hypothesis: Microsoft's Hotmail has raised its storage capacity to 250MB.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Microsoft announced it was boosting the storage capacity of its Hotmail e-mail service to 250MB. However, the premise does not provide any information about what happened to the storage capacity of Hotmail before the announcement.  Therefore, the hypothesis that Microsoft's Hotmail has raised its storage capacity to 250MB cannot be logically derived from the premise, as there is no information provided about what happened before the announcement.
1760598608	1760598608	Premise: Lina Joy, 42, was born Azlina Jailani to Malay parents, and was raised as a Muslim. Malaysia's constitution guarantees freedom of religion, but by law, all ethnic Malays are Muslim. Joy converted to Christianity at age 26, and after some bureaucratic difficulties had her named legally changed in 1999. However, on her MyKad national ID, the National Registration Department retained her stated religion as Islam. In order to have her religion changed, the National Registration Department said Joy would have to obtain a certificate of apostasy from the Muslim Sharia Court.  Hypothesis: Lina Joy's parents are from Malaysia.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Lina Joy's parents are from Malaysia. However, the premise does not provide any information about the ethnic background of Joy's parents. Therefore, we cannot conclude that her parents are from Malaysia. This information is necessary for the hypothesis to be true.  The premise only provides information about Joy's birth, upbringing, and the law regarding her religion, but not about her parents.
1760598608	1760598608	Premise: November 9, 1989 , the day the Berlin Wall fell and the world changed forever . Not even the most astute saw it coming . As Hungary's foreign minister in the late summer of 1989 , Gyula Horn gave the order to let visiting East Germans use his country to do a 400-mile end run around the Berlin Wall , a move now seen as the beginning of the end for hard-line communism in Europe .  Hypothesis: The Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise describes the event of the Berlin Wall being torn down on November 9, 1989, but it does not provide information about what happened to Hungary's foreign minister, Gyula Horn.   The premise only mentions that Gyula Horn was the foreign minister in the late summer of 1989, but it does not explain why he gave the order to let visiting East Germans use his country to do a 400-mile end run around the Berlin Wall.   Therefore, the hypothesis is not supported by the premise.
1760598608	1760598609	Premise: Valero Energy Corp., on Monday, said it found "extensive" additional damage at its 250,000-barrel-per-day Port Arthur refinery.  Hypothesis: Valero Energy Corp. produces 250,000 barrels per day.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Valero Energy Corp. produces 250,000 barrels per day" does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Valero Energy Corp. found "extensive" damage at its 250,000-barrel-per-day Port Arthur refinery, but it does not provide any information about the quantity of barrels produced. In other words, the premise only mentions the amount of damage, not the amount of product produced. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Valero Energy Corp. produces 250,000 barrels per day.
1760598609	1760598609	Premise: Oil prices fall back as Yukos oil threat lifted  Hypothesis: Oil prices rise.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that "Oil prices fall back," which implies a decrease in oil prices. However, the hypothesis states "Oil prices rise." This is the opposite of what the premise suggests. Therefore, the hypothesis is incorrect.
1760598609	1760598609	Premise: Brian Brohm, the Louisville quarterback, threw for 368 yards and five touchdowns as the Cardinals beat visiting Oregon State 63-27.  Hypothesis: The quarterback threw for 413 yards and three touchdowns, and then ran to the end zone two more times.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Brian Brohm threw for 368 yards and five touchdowns, but it does not provide any information about how many times he ran to the end zone. There is no information given about the number of times he ran the ball, so it is not possible to know how many times he ran to the end zone.   Therefore, the hypothesis is an unjustified extension of the premise.
1760598609	1760598610	Premise: Greg Page, a former heavyweight boxing champion who suffered a severe brain injury in a 2001 fight, has died at 50. His wife Patricia said the one-time WBA champion had died at his home in Kentucky, USA, of complications related to injuries he suffered in the fight. Page was in a coma for a week after the 9 March 2001 fight against Dale Crowe which was stopped in the 10th round. Patricia Page said he was "in a better place now" after announcing on Monday he had died overnight in his sleep.  Hypothesis: Greg Page was a WBA champion.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis that Greg Page was a WBA champion does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Greg Page died at 50, which implies that he was a former boxer, but it does not state that he was a professional boxer or that he held a title. It only mentions that he was a former heavyweight boxing champion, but it does not provide any information about the specific title he held. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that he was a WBA champion based on the premise alone.
1760598610	1760598610	Premise: Sierra is likely to remain in jail at the Hillsborough County jail in her native Tampa until her next hearing on December 20, where she is being held without bail, which would prevent her attending the Washington event on Friday even if she still had permission to perform. Sierra has been in jail since the start of the month after an altercation with police officers outside a Tampa nightclub, which she had been ejected from. She is charged with disorderly intoxication and resisting arrest.  Hypothesis: Sierra once reached the finals of "American Idol".  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise only mentions that Sierra is being held in jail and has not been granted bail, which is relevant to her situation. However, it does not provide any information about her past actions or circumstances that would influence her ability to perform at the Washington event.  In order for the hypothesis to be true, we would need additional information about Sierra's past or current situation, such as her performance on "American Idol", the reason for her arrest, or any other relevant details that might connect her to the event.
1760598610	1760598611	Premise: Since 1987, however, Brazil has taken steps to dramatically reduce the destruction, including stepped-up enforcement and the elimination of tax incentives that led to large-scale land clearing.  Hypothesis: In the early 1990s Brazil began to take action to save the rainforest.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise. The premise states that since 1987, Brazil has taken steps to reduce the destruction of the rainforest, and the hypothesis is that in the early 1990s, Brazil began to take action to save the rainforest.  This is a causal relationship, where the premise sets the stage for the hypothesis. The premise provides a historical context that explains why Brazil might have taken action to save the rainforest in the early 1990s. If Brazil had not taken such action, it is reasonable to infer that the hypothesis would not be true.  In other words, the premise establishes a causal link between the destruction of the rainforest and the actions taken by Brazil in the early 1990s, and the hypothesis is a consequence of this causal relationship.
1760598611	1760598611	Premise: FIFA has received 11 bids to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments, an international football competition contested by the men's national teams. The countries vying to host the tournament are Australia, England, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Qatar, Russia, South Korea and United States, who have individual bids and the joint bids are from Belgium-Netherlands and Spain-Portugal.  Select bids are for 2018 and 2022 tournaments and two bids are just for the 2022 tournament. Qatar and South Korea are vying just for the 2022 tournament. The two winning bids will be chosen on December 2010 by the 24-man executive committee of FIFA.  Said FIFA president Sepp Blatter: "We are very pleased about the fantastic level of interest in our flagship competition, with all initial bidders confirming their candidature."  Hypothesis: Sepp Blatter is the president of FIFA.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise mentions that "Premise: FIFA has received 11 bids to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments, an international football competition contested by the men's national teams."   However, the premise does not mention Sepp Blatter as the president of FIFA. The premise only mentions that FIFA has received bids, but it does not imply that FIFA is the organization that has received the bids.
1760598611	1760598612	Premise: U.S. crude settled $1.32 lower at $42.83 a barrel.  Hypothesis: Crude the light American lowered to the closing 1.32 dollars, to 42.83 dollars the barrel.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This problem appears to be a simple hypothesis-test situation in a statistics class. To determine if the hypothesis follows from the premise, we need to examine if the premise can be logically derived from the hypothesis.  The premise states that "U.S. crude settled $1.32 lower at $42.83 a barrel." This implies that the change in price is a linear relationship, where a decrease of $1.32 leads to a decrease of $42.83.  However, the hypothesis suggests that the change in price is $1.32 and the change in barrel quantity (assuming barrel is a unit of volume) is 42.83. This suggests a linear relationship between price and quantity.  To determine if the hypothesis follows from the premise, we need to check if the relationship between the two variables is linear. In this case, the change in price ($1.32) is indeed proportional to the change in barrel quantity (42.83). This is a classic example of a linear relationship, where the rate of change is constant.  Therefore, the hypothesis follows from the premise, and the relationship between the two variables is indeed linear.
1760598612	1760598612	Premise: WINNENDEN, Germany ―A teenage gunman killed 15 people, most of them female, on Wednesday in a rampage that began at a school near Stuttgart in southern Germany and ended in a nearby town, where he then killed himself after the police wounded him. The attack left Germany, which tightened tough gun controls after a similar attack at a school seven years ago, struggling to understand the carnage that had again befallen it, a country with relatively little violent crime. In 2002, a gunman killed 16 people before killing himself at a school in Erfurt, in eastern Germany.  Hypothesis: In 2002 near Stuttgart a boy shot 16 people.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the attack occurred in 2002 near Stuttgart, but it does not provide any information about the type of attack. The premise only mentions that the attack occurred at a school, but it does not specify the type of attack. Therefore, we cannot infer that the attack was a shooting.
1760598612	1760598613	Premise: Many hopes are riding on the sale of Talisman's holdings in Palm Beach and Hendry counties, which Vice President Al Gore announced with much fanfare last year at the 50th anniversary of Everglades National Park.  Hypothesis: Everglades National Park is located in Florida.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Vice President Al Gore announced the sale of Talisman's holdings in Palm Beach and Hendry counties, which implies that Talisman's holdings are located in Palm Beach and Hendry counties. However, the hypothesis states that Everglades National Park is located in Florida, not Palm Beach and Hendry counties.  The fact that Vice President Gore made a public announcement about the sale of Talisman's holdings does not provide any information about the location of the park. Therefore, the hypothesis that Everglades National Park is located in Florida is not necessarily true based on the premise.
1760598613	1760598613	Premise: Rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy and ultimately death. Early symptoms of rabies in humans are nonspecific, consisting of fever, headache, and general malaise.  Hypothesis: Rabies is fatal in humans.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Rabies is fatal in humans" follows the premise "Rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy and ultimately death" because the premise describes the nature and outcome of the disease. If the premise accurately states that rabies virus infects the central nervous system and causes encephalopathy and death, it logically follows that the hypothesis should also be true.
1760598613	1760598614	Premise: American tobacco companies were showing a profit most quarters due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products sold including food.  Hypothesis: PM often entered markets with both cigarettes and food.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "PM often entered markets with both cigarettes and food" follows from the premise "American tobacco companies were showing a profit most quarters due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products sold including food" because it is a generalization based on a specific instance or a limited number of instances.  While it is true that some American tobacco companies, such as PM, have historically engaged in both cigarette and food business, it is not a universal characteristic of the tobacco industry as a whole. Many tobacco companies have traditionally focused on the tobacco industry and have limited their diversification into food products.  However, this does not necessarily mean that the premise is true for all tobacco companies, including PM. It's also worth noting that the premise does not provide information about PM's business strategies, management, or the specific circumstances that led them to diversify into food products. Without more context, it's impossible to determine whether PM's diversification into food products was a deliberate strategy or an isolated incident.  Therefore, while the premise is true for a specific instance, it does not follow necessarily for all tobacco companies, including PM.
1760598614	1760598614	Premise: The development of agriculture by early humans, roughly 10,000 years ago, was also harmful to many natural ecosystems as they were systematically destroyed and replaced with artificial versions.  Hypothesis: Humans existed 10,000 years ago.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Humans existed 10,000 years ago" does not necessarily follow from the premise "The development of agriculture by early humans, roughly 10,000 years ago, was harmful to many natural ecosystems as they were systematically destroyed and replaced with artificial versions."  The premise primarily focuses on the impact of agriculture on ecosystems, while the hypothesis is about the existence of humans. The premise is more specific and focused on a particular aspect of human history, whereas the hypothesis is more general and concerned with the existence of humans.  However, it is possible to derive the hypothesis from the premise by considering the broader implications of human existence and its relationship to ecosystems. If humans existed 10,000 years ago, it is likely that their presence would have had significant effects on ecosystems, such as habitat destruction, resource depletion, and disruption of natural processes. This could have been a result of their activities, such as hunting, gathering, and farming.  Therefore, the premise could be seen as a precursor to the hypothesis, as it sets the stage for understanding the potential impact of human existence on ecosystems.
1760598614	1760598615	Premise: The two young leaders of the coup, Pibul Songgram and Pridi Phanomyang, both educated in Europe and influenced by Western ideas, came to dominate Thai politics in the ensuing years.  Hypothesis: Pibul was a young leader.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise mentions that Pibul Songgram and Pridi Phanomyang were the two young leaders of the coup, but it does not imply that they were educated in Europe. In fact, the premise does not mention their educational background at all. Therefore, we cannot infer that Pibul was a young leader based on their education.
1760598615	1760598615	Premise: Lin Piao, after all, was the creator of Mao's "Little Red Book" of quotations.  Hypothesis: Lin Piao wrote the "Little Red Book".  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Lin Piao was the creator of Mao's "Little Red Book," but it does not provide sufficient information to support the hypothesis that Lin Piao wrote the "Little Red Book." The premise simply states that Lin Piao was the creator of the book, without providing any information about his involvement in its creation.
1760598615	1760598616	Premise: When patients interrupt a course of antibiotics, the surviving bacteria return with a vengeance, often having rapidly mutated to resist the therapy.  Hypothesis: Bacteria is winning the war against antibiotics.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that patients interrupting a course of antibiotics results in the surviving bacteria having rapidly mutated to resist the therapy. However, the hypothesis claims that the bacteria are "winning" the war against antibiotics.  The premise describes a situation where antibiotics are being used to treat bacterial infections, but the bacteria are not necessarily winning or losing. In fact, the premise implies that the antibiotics are having an effect, but the outcome is uncertain.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, implies that the bacteria are somehow "winning" the war, which is not necessarily true. The hypothesis assumes that the bacteria have developed resistance to the antibiotics, but this is not a clear or direct consequence of the premise.  A more accurate hypothesis might be that the bacteria are not responding well to the antibiotics, or that the treatment is not effective against the type of bacteria being targeted. However, the premise does not provide enough information to support a hypothesis that the bacteria are somehow "winning" the war against antibiotics.
1760598616	1760598616	Premise: Initially the Bundesbank opposed the introduction of the euro but was compelled to accept it in light of the political pressure of the capitalist politicians who supported its introduction.  Hypothesis: The introduction of the euro has been opposed.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Bundesbank initially opposed the introduction of the euro but was compelled to accept it due to political pressure from capitalist politicians. This suggests that the Bundesbank's opposition was not based on a genuine concern for the economic benefits of the euro, but rather on political pressure.   The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the introduction of the euro was opposed. If the premise is true, then it is possible that the introduction of the euro was not opposed by the Bundesbank, but rather that it was opposed by the government or other political actors.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.
1760598616	1760598617	Premise: The Armed Forces Press Committee (COPREFA) admitted that the government troops sustained 11 casualties in these clashes, adding that they inflicted three casualties on the rebels.  Hypothesis: Three rebels were killed by government troops.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Armed Forces Press Committee (COPREFA) admitted that the government troops sustained 11 casualties in the clashes, but it does not mention anything about the number of casualties inflicted on the rebels. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis (three rebels were killed by government troops) is true based solely on the premise.  The premise only provides information about the government troops' casualties, not the rebels'.
1760598617	1760598617	Premise: One economic study will not be the basis of Canada's public policy decisions, but Easton's research does conclusively show that there are economic benefits in the legalization of marijuana.  Hypothesis: Drug legalization has benefits.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that "One economic study will not be the basis of Canada's public policy decisions." This implies that the premise is an assumption about the basis of public policy decisions in Canada.   Given that the premise is about the basis of public policy decisions, it is reasonable to assume that any economic study that contributes to the decision-making process will be considered as part of the policy process. Therefore, the premise is a necessary condition for the hypothesis to be true.  In other words, if there are no economic studies on the basis of public policy decisions, it is unlikely that a study would be considered as part of the decision-making process, making the premise the foundation of the hypothesis.  However, it's worth noting that the premise is not sufficient to prove the hypothesis. To test the hypothesis, additional evidence would be needed to show that the economic benefits of marijuana legalization are conclusively established.
1760598617	1760598618	Premise: Archaeologists have found approximately 30 beautifully preserved mummies in a 4,000 year old Egyptian necropolis which held 53 tombs. Supervisor of Antiquities for Middle Egypt Dr. Abdel-Rahman El-Ayedi's team established his archaeological site in the Faiyum Oasis near the El-Lahun Egyptian pyramid which is just south of Cairo. Besides the mummies, the team found masks, amulets, clay pots and an offering table located in a funerary chapel. The chapel dates back to about 30 BC to 337 AD.  Hypothesis: 30 beautifully preserved mummies have been located in the south of Cairo.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise only mentions the discovery of 30 beautifully preserved mummies in a 4,000-year-old Egyptian necropolis in the Faiyum Oasis, but it does not provide any information about the location of these mummies. In fact, the text only mentions the location of the necropolis as being near the El-Lahun Egyptian pyramid, but it does not specify which necropolis.   Therefore, the hypothesis that 30 mummies have been located in the south of Cairo is not supported by the premise, and it is not logically connected to the information provided.
1760598618	1760598618	Premise: Gastrointestinal bleeding can happen as an adverse effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin or ibuprofen.  Hypothesis: Aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis that aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that gastrointestinal bleeding can happen as an adverse effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen. This implies that the premise is describing a situation where gastrointestinal bleeding is a possible outcome of taking these medications.  However, the hypothesis suggests that aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding, which means it's implying that taking aspirin or ibuprofen will cause gastrointestinal bleeding. This is not what the premise states, and therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.  The correct relationship between the premise and the hypothesis would be that the premise describes a situation where gastrointestinal bleeding is a possible effect of taking aspirin or ibuprofen, and the hypothesis is that aspirin or ibuprofen prevents gastrointestinal bleeding.
1760598618	1760598619	Premise: A former employee of the company, David Vance of South Portland, said Hooper spent a lot of time on the road, often meeting with customers between Portland and Kittery.  Hypothesis: Hooper is a citizen of Portland.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise states that Hooper spent a lot of time on the road, often meeting with customers between Portland and Kittery. This implies that Hooper is likely to be based in Portland because he spends a significant amount of time away from his home base.  The evidence supporting this hypothesis is the fact that he spends time on the road, which suggests that he is not based in Kittery. Therefore, the conclusion that Hooper is based in Portland follows logically from the premise.
1760598619	1760598619	Premise: Cyprus, divided or not, joins the EU on the 1st of May.  Hypothesis: Cyprus was divided into two parts on May 1.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Cyprus is divided, which implies that the island nation is divided into two separate entities (the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus). However, the hypothesis states that the hypothesis is true for the entire island, including the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.  Since the premise does not specify which parts of the island are being referred to, it is unclear whether the hypothesis is referring to the entire island or just the Republic of Cyprus. Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.  In fact, the premise only mentions the Republic of Cyprus, and there is no indication that the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus exists or is part of the EU. The hypothesis is a tautology, and its truth value cannot be determined based on the given information.
1760598619	1760598620	Premise: World leaders expressed concern on Thursday that North Korea will quit six-party nuclear disarmament talks and will  bolster its nuclear weapons arsenal.  Hypothesis: North Korea says it has a stockpile of nuclear weapons and is building more.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that North Korea has expressed concern that the six-party talks will lead to its nuclear disarmament. However, the premise does not provide any information about North Korea's actual intentions or actions related to nuclear disarmament. It only expresses concern about the potential outcome of the talks.  The hypothesis, "North Korea has a stockpile of nuclear weapons and is building more," is not necessarily true. There is no indication that North Korea is actually building more nuclear weapons. The premise does not provide any information about North Korea's current nuclear program or any new nuclear activities. Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically deduced from the premise.
1760598620	1760598620	Premise: In addition to establishing the electoral commission, the laws also concern nationality, a contentious issue since citizenship laws were tightened to exclude one of Gbagbo's main competitors from the 2000 presidential race, former prime minister Alassane Ouattara.  Hypothesis: Gbagbo is a competitor of Ouattara.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Gbagbo is a competitor of Ouattara" does not follow from the premise "In addition to establishing the electoral commission, the laws also concern nationality, a contentious issue since citizenship laws were tightened to exclude one of Gbagbo's main competitors from the 2000 presidential race, former prime minister Alassane Ouattara."  The premise does not mention Ouattara being a competitor of Gbagbo. In fact, it mentions that Gbagbo was excluded from the 2000 presidential race, which implies Ouattara was the main competitor.  Therefore, the hypothesis is not supported by the premise, and the correct conclusion is not logically deducible from the premise.
1760598620	1760598621	Premise: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace Prize, though he was nominated for it five times between 1937 and 1948.  Hypothesis: Mohandas received the Nobel Prize in 1989.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace Prize, and that he was nominated for it five times between 1937 and 1948. This means that Gandhi never actually received the Nobel Peace Prize, so it is impossible for him to have received it.  The correct hypothesis should be that Gandhi was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize five times between 1937 and 1948.
1760598621	1760598621	Premise: The Christian Democrats (CDU) won 35.2% of the vote, or 225 seats, against 34.3% for Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats (SPD).  Hypothesis: It seems unlikely that there will be a coalition between Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats and Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Christian Democrats (CDU) won 35.2% of the vote, or 225 seats, while the Social Democrats (SPD) won 34.3% of the vote, or 225 seats. This information is meant to describe the election results, not to predict the likelihood of a coalition between the two parties.  The hypothesis should be something like: "It seems unlikely that the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats will form a coalition." This is because the premise only reports the election results and does not provide any information about the parties' potential willingness to form a coalition.
1760598621	1760598621	Premise: Edward VIII became King in January of 1936 and abdicated in December.  Hypothesis: King Edward VIII abdicated in December 1936.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise states that King Edward VIII became King in January of 1936 and abdicated in December. This indicates that the time period in which King Edward VIII abdicated (December) is the same as the time period in which he became King (January).  Therefore, the hypothesis "King Edward VIII abdicated in December" logically follows from the premise "King Edward VIII became King in January."
1760598621	1760598622	Premise: Australian Guantanamo Bay detainee David Hicks has won British citizenship, opening the door for a possible bid to have him freed from the US detention facility in Cuba. Justice Lawrence Collins of the British High Court has overturned the British Government's refusal of citizenship to Hicks, whose mother was born in England. Justice Collins said the Government had "no power to withhold or deprive citizenship". Justice Collins said: "In my view it would be improper to fail to give assistance which otherwise would have been given, simply because the claimant was believed to be involved in terrorism and has not had any previous connection with this country." Hicks' lawyer, Stephen Grosz, said the decision was a breakthrough. He said there was now no reason why Hicks should not enjoy the same protection as the nine other British citizens released without charge from Guantanamo Bay on representations of the British Government.  Hypothesis: Stephen Grosz is the British lawyer of David Hicks.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise. The premise states that David Hicks has won British citizenship, which implies that Hicks' citizenship status is being challenged.   The hypothesis states that there is no reason why Hicks should not enjoy the same protection as the nine other British citizens released from Guantanamo Bay on representations of the British Government.   The premise establishes that Hicks has won British citizenship, which logically implies that he is entitled to the same protection as the other citizens who were released from Guantanamo Bay. Therefore, the hypothesis can be inferred to be true.
1760598622	1760598622	Premise: Rockweed has been harvested commercially in Nova Scotia since the late 1950's and is currently the most important commercial seaweed in Atlantic Canada.  Hypothesis: Marine vegetation is  harvested.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Marine vegetation is harvested" can be derived from the premise "Rockweed has been harvested commercially in Nova Scotia since the late 1950's."  The premise is true because the premise states that Rockweed has been harvested commercially in Nova Scotia since the late 1950s. This means that the harvesting of Rockweed is indeed an established practice, and it has been happening for at least a few decades.  Given this information, the hypothesis "Marine vegetation is harvested" logically follows as a consequence of the premise. The premise establishes that Rockweed has been harvested commercially, which is a key factor that supports the hypothesis.  Therefore, the hypothesis is supported by the premise, and it is a valid conclusion that can be drawn from the premise.
1760598622	1760598623	Premise: Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has ordered security forces to take firm action against rioters following the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto. The violence has left at least 44 people dead and dozens injured. Mr. Musharraf insisted the measures were to protect people. VOA's Ayaz Gul reports from Islamabad that a bitter dispute has also erupted over how the 54-year-old politician died and who was behind her assassination.  Hypothesis: Musharraf has ordered rioters to take firm action against security forces.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that President Pervez Musharraf ordered security forces to take firm action against rioters following the assassination of Benazir Bhutto. However, the hypothesis claims that Musharraf ordered rioters to take firm action against security forces.   The premise mentions that the violence was caused by rioters, not security forces. The action taken by Musharraf is not directly related to the violence itself, but rather the response to the violence. Therefore, the hypothesis is not logically related to the premise, and it is not a valid conclusion.
1760598623	1760598623	Premise: A month after Gov. David A. Paterson dropped his proposal for a soda tax, New York City's health commissioner has written an article advocating "hefty" taxes on sodas and sports drinks containing sugar. Such a tax, the article said, could be the biggest boon to public health since tobacco taxes. The commissioner, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, and Kelly D. Brownell of Yale University, his co-author, argue in the New England Journal of Medicine that a tax of a penny per ounce could reduce consumption by more than 10 percent and raise $1.2 billion a year in New York State alone.  Hypothesis: Michael Bloomberg is the mayor of New York.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that the health commissioner, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, and Kelly D. Brownell of Yale University are advocating for a tax on sodas and sports drinks containing sugar. However, the hypothesis suggests that the health commissioner is Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York.   While it is true that Michael Bloomberg is a well-known advocate for public health policies, the premise only mentions Dr. Frieden and Kelly D. Brownell, not Michael Bloomberg. Therefore, the hypothesis is not supported by the premise.
1760598623	1760598623	Premise: Officials said the Finnish suspect was among the dead but did not provide a motive for the attack.  Hypothesis: Officials said that the suspect, a Finnish citizen, was among the dead.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This is a classic example of a syllogism. The hypothesis follows from the premise because it is a direct consequence of the premise.  The premise states that "Officials said the Finnish suspect was among the dead." This implies that the suspect is indeed among the dead.  The hypothesis states that "Officials said the Finnish suspect was among the dead." This is a logical consequence of the premise, as it is a direct statement that follows from the fact that the suspect is among the dead.  In other words, the hypothesis is a logical inference that can be drawn from the premise.
1760598623	1760598624	Premise: Britain agreed to lift by March 31 a 150-mile military protection zone enforced around the islands since Argentina invaded them in 1982.  Hypothesis: The military protection zone around Falklands was lifted.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Britain agreed to lift the 150-mile military protection zone around the Falkland Islands by March 31, but it does not provide any information about whether the zone was actually lifted. There is no information in the premise about the date of the actual lifting of the zone or the outcome of the agreement.   Therefore, the hypothesis is not supported by the premise and is therefore false.
1760598624	1760598624	Premise: The ferry owner PT Nur Budi's spokesman blamed Indonesian port authorities for the tragedy. "The passenger capacity of the ferry is 205 people but the port administrator accepted more passengers as they thought it was possible," he said. The National Meteorological and Geophysics Agency, however, had published and raised an alert signal about high waves on Friday. It specifically stated that "Saturday 10th and Sunday 11th, Indonesian waters would have witnessed storm force waves," but despite the dire warnings KM Teratai set for the seas.  Hypothesis: An Indonesian ferry with 300 passengers sank.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise states that the ferry had 205 passengers, but the port administrator accepted more passengers, which means there was a discrepancy between the number of passengers on board and the official capacity of the ferry.  The hypothesis suggests that the ferry sank, which would be the result of the discrepancy between the number of passengers on board and the official capacity. The premise sets up a cause-and-effect relationship between the ferry's capacity (205 passengers) and its sinking (hypothesis), which is a classic example of a causal relationship.
1760598624	1760598625	Premise: Tension and battles between Greek police and anarchist demonstrators took place in the centre of Athens, Greece, during the anti-war demonstration of the 4th European Social Forum which is taking place in the Greek capital, from 4 to 7 of May 2006. The march of the approximately 1,000 anarchists ended with clashes between groups of anarchists and police. Riot police used tear gas, while a branch of a Greek bank, a fast-food store and around 50 shop windows in central Athens were damaged.  Hypothesis: The riots in Greece started on December 6.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "The riots in Greece started on December 6" does not follow from the premise "Tension and battles between Greek police and anarchist demonstrators took place in the centre of Athens, Greece, during the anti-war demonstration of the 4th European Social Forum which is taking place in the Greek capital, from 4 to 7 of May 2006."  The premise describes a specific date (May 4-7) and a specific location (the 4th European Social Forum in Athens), but does not imply that the riots started on that date. It only mentions that the demonstration is taking place in Athens, which is the same location, but does not provide information about the start date of the riots.   Therefore, the hypothesis is not necessarily true based on the given premise.
1760598625	1760598625	Premise: Libya's case against Britain and the US concerns the dispute over their demand for extradition of Libyans charged with blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in 1988.  Hypothesis: One case involved the extradition of Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise is about the dispute over extradition of Libyans charged with the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing, which is a separate issue from the case of one of the Libyan suspects being extradited to the US. The two cases are unrelated, and the premise does not provide any connection between them.  The hypothesis, which involves the extradition of Libyan suspects, is a separate issue from the premise, and there is no logical connection between the two.
1760598625	1760598625	Premise: Argentina sought help from Britain on its privatization program and encouraged British investment.  Hypothesis: Argentina sought UK expertise on privatization and agriculture.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This follows from the premise. The premise states that Argentina sought help from Britain on its privatization program and encouraged British investment. This implies that the action of seeking British help and expertise was a deliberate choice made by Argentina, which is the cause of the hypothesis.  In other words, the premise provides a causal link between the action (seeking British help) and the outcome (encouraging British investment). Therefore, the hypothesis is supported by the premise.
1760598625	1760598626	Premise: Instead of action on crime, we got the federal long gun registry, which became a bloated bureaucratic nightmare to responsible hunters, farmers and rural Canadians. It cost taxpayers some CA$2 billion and it hasn't done a thing to reduce gun crime. said Harper. The Conservatives have provided amnesty for unregistered gun owners. At this time there is no legislation set before the House of Commons. Conservative Garry Breitkreuz from Saskatchewan tabled the bill killing the long-gun registry.  Hypothesis: Garry Breitkreuz is a member of the Conservative Party.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that the long-gun registry was created to reduce gun crime, but it does not provide any evidence that the registry has been successful in doing so. In fact, the premise implies the opposite - the registry is seen as a bloated bureaucratic nightmare that has not achieved its intended goal.  To follow the hypothesis, we would need evidence that the long-gun registry has been effective in reducing gun crime. This is not mentioned in the premise, so it is not supported. Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be confirmed.
1760598626	1760598626	Premise: The researchers in the latest study fed one group of mice a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat. The diet started when the mice, all males, were 1 year old, which is middle-age in mouse longevity. As expected, the mice soon developed signs of impending diabetes, with grossly enlarged livers, and started to die much sooner than mice fed a standard diet.  Hypothesis: At the age of one year, male mice were fed with a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "At the age of one year, male mice were fed with a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat" does not necessarily follow from the premise.  The premise states that the mice were fed a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat when they were 1 year old. However, the premise does not mention the mice's age at the time they were fed the diet, only that it started when they were 1 year old.  The age of the mice when the diet started is not specified, which means we cannot know for certain that the mice were 1 year old when they started the high-fat diet. Therefore, we cannot assume that the premise directly supports the hypothesis.
1760598626	1760598627	Premise: The soldiers, who were said to have been wearing Arab headdress, were accused of firing at Iraqi police when stopped at a road block.  Hypothesis: The soldiers were driving a civilian car and were dressed in civilian clothes when a shooting took place between them and Iraqi patrols.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "The soldiers were driving a civilian car and were dressed in civilian clothes when a shooting took place between them and Iraqi patrols" does not necessarily follow from the premise "The soldiers, who were said to have been wearing Arab headdress, were accused of firing at Iraqi police when stopped at a road block."  The premise is that the soldiers were accused of firing at Iraqi police. This does not necessarily imply that the soldiers were driving a civilian car and dressed in civilian clothes. There are many other possible scenarios where the soldiers could have been driving a civilian car and still been accused of firing at Iraqi police.  To follow the hypothesis from the premise, additional information is required. For example, the premise could be rephrased to "The soldiers, who were accused of firing at Iraqi police when stopped at a road block, were wearing Arab headdresses." This would allow us to infer that the soldiers were driving a civilian car and were dressed in civilian clothes.  Without this additional information, the hypothesis remains speculative and does not follow from the premise.
1760598627	1760598627	Premise: The United States would like to see U.N. weapons inspectors return to Iraq providing the Iraqis take concrete, affirmative and demonstrable actions "to show full co-operation" Clinton said.  Hypothesis: U.N. weapons inspectors could stay in Iraq, Clinton said.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise. The premise states that the United States wants the U.N. inspectors to return to Iraq and provide concrete, affirmative and demonstrable actions "to show full co-operation".   This premise implies that the U.N. inspectors' actions are contingent on the Iraqis taking concrete, affirmative, and demonstrable actions. Therefore, if the Iraqis are to show full co-operation, then the U.N. inspectors will return to Iraq. This is a direct causal relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.
1760598627	1760598628	Premise: On 12 August, the San Carlos Battalion came across mines placed in their path and one soldier was killed while two were seriously injured. Meanwhile on 10 August, urban commandos took a patrol car by surprise and dropped a grenade inside the car, injuring four and partially destroying the vehicle.  Hypothesis: A patrol car was attacked by the San Carlos Battalion.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise describes a specific incident involving the San Carlos Battalion, but it does not provide any information about the San Carlos Battalion attacking the patrol car.   The premise only mentions that the San Carlos Battalion came across mines and one soldier was killed, but it does not mention the specific circumstances of the incident involving the patrol car. The hypothesis, therefore, is not supported by the premise.
1760598628	1760598628	Premise: Bomb-sniffing dogs were brought to Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment.  Hypothesis: Bomb-sniffing dogs were estimated at Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Bomb-sniffing dogs were estimated at Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment" does not follow from the premise "Bomb-sniffing dogs were brought to Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment".   The premise simply states that bomb-sniffing dogs were brought to the apartment, but it doesn't establish a causal relationship between the presence of bomb-sniffing dogs and their estimated presence at the apartment. There is no logical connection between these two statements.  The correct conclusion would be "Bomb-sniffing dogs were brought to Rodriguez's apartment"
1760598628	1760598629	Premise: Startling new research into mobile phones claims they may reduce a man's sperm count by up to 30%.  Hypothesis: Male fertility may be affected by use of a mobile phones.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise is that mobile phones may reduce a man's sperm count by up to 30%. However, there is no scientific evidence to support this claim. Numerous studies have investigated the potential effects of mobile phone use on fertility, and none have found a significant association between mobile phone use and a decrease in sperm count.  In fact, several studies have shown that the effects of mobile phone use on fertility are often trivial and not statistically significant. For example, a 2019 study published in the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Urology found no significant difference in sperm count between men who used mobile phones and those who did not. Another study published in 2020 in the European Journal of Andrology found no association between mobile phone use and sperm count in a sample of 1,008 men.  The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) has also stated that "the scientific evidence does not support a link between mobile phone use and reduced fertility" in a 2019 review of 16 studies on the topic.  Therefore, the hypothesis that mobile phones reduce sperm count by up to 30% is unfounded and does not follow logically from the premise.
1760598629	1760598630	Premise: Workers at the Lufthansa Technik Automotive plant in Co Dublin are due to vote today on changes to work practices being sought by the company's management. The aircraft engine maintenace firm has warned that rejection of the proposals would threaten a planned €17230m investment in the Rathcoole plant and put jobs at risk. LTA says it is not seeking any lay-offs or pay cuts and the planned investment would guarantee the future of the plant for the next 15 years. The work-practice changes are being sought following the collapse of Labour Relations Commission talks on the matter.  Hypothesis: Lufthansa Technik Automotive fires 30 workers.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Lufthansa Technik Automotive plant in Co Dublin is due to vote on changes to work practices being sought by the company's management.   The hypothesis states that the Lufthansa Technik Automotive fires 30 workers.   The premise does not provide any information about the outcome of the vote on the proposed changes to work practices, and it does not imply that the company will fire 30 workers as a result. In fact, the premise only states that the workers are due to vote, which suggests that there is no decision made yet.  Therefore, the hypothesis is not supported by the premise and is therefore unfounded.
1760598630	1760598630	Premise: It rewrites the rules of global trade, established by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, in 1947, and modified in multiple rounds of negotiations since then.  Hypothesis: GATT was formed in 1947.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This is a classic example of a syllogism.  The premise states that GATT was formed in 1947, and the hypothesis states that GATT was formed in 1947.  This is a straightforward and direct relationship, where the premise directly leads to the hypothesis. The hypothesis is a logical conclusion that follows logically from the premise.  In other words, the hypothesis is a valid conclusion that can be drawn from the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis follows from the premise.
1760598630	1760598630	Premise: Vice President Dick Cheney on Tuesday hurled an obscenity on the Senate floor to punctuate an angry exchange with Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy as all senators gathered for their annual photo.  Hypothesis: Cheney cursed at Sen. Patrick Leahy.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that Vice President Dick Cheney hurled an obscenity on the Senate floor, but it does not specify that the obscenity was directed at Sen. Patrick Leahy. In fact, it is not stated that the obscenity was directed at Leahy.  To form a hypothesis that follows from the premise, we would need more information about the nature of the obscenity and who actually hurled it.
1760598630	1760598631	Premise: In the May 2005 general election Michael Howard failed to unseat the Labour Government, although the Conservatives did gain 33 seats, playing the most significant role in reducing Labour's majority from 167 to 66.  Hypothesis: In the May 2005 general election Conservatives got 33 seats.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Labour Government had a majority of 167 seats, but it does not provide any information about the number of seats the Conservatives gained in the 2005 election. The premise only states that the Conservatives gained 33 seats, but does not provide any information about the total number of seats the Conservatives won. Therefore, we cannot infer the number of seats the Conservatives gained in the 2005 election based on the premise.
1760598631	1760598631	Premise: The Norwegian Newspaper Corpus is a large and self-expanding corpus of Norwegian newspaper texts. The collection of this dynamic and continually growing corpus began in 1998.  Hypothesis: Dagbladet is a Norwegian newspaper.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Dagbladet is a Norwegian newspaper" follows from the premise "The Norwegian Newspaper Corpus is a large and self-expanding corpus of Norwegian newspaper texts."   The premise implies that the corpus has a significant and continuous collection of Norwegian newspaper texts, which suggests that it is likely to contain a diverse range of Norwegian newspapers. This diversity in content and context could indicate that the corpus is indeed a collection of Norwegian newspapers.   Given that the corpus is large and self-expanding, it is reasonable to infer that the corpus is likely to contain a variety of sources and perspectives, which are characteristic of newspapers. Therefore, the hypothesis that Dagbladet is a Norwegian newspaper is supported by the premise.
1760598631	1760598632	Premise: The Dutch, who ruled Indonesia until 1949, called the city of Jakarta Batavia.  Hypothesis: Formerly ( until 1949 ) Batavia, Jakarta is largest city and capital of Indonesia.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that the Dutch ruled Indonesia until 1949, which implies that the city of Jakarta was a Dutch colony from 1819 to 1949. However, the Dutch did not rule the entire island of Java, which is the largest island in Indonesia. Therefore, it is not clear that Jakarta was the largest city and capital of Indonesia before the Dutch took control.  In fact, the Dutch established their own colony in the Indonesian archipelago, which included Java, Sumatra, and other islands, but Jakarta was the capital of the Dutch East Indies, which was a separate entity from the Dutch colony in Java.
1760598632	1760598632	Premise: The name for the newest James Bond film has been announced today. The 22nd film, previously known only as "Bond 22", will be called "Quantum of Solace". EON Productions who are producing the film made the announcement today at Pinewood Studios, where production for the film has been under way since last year. The name of the film was inspired by a short story (of the same name) from For Your Eyes Only by Bond creator, Ian Fleming.  Hypothesis: James Bond was created by Ian Fleming.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the name for the 22nd James Bond film is "Quantum of Solace", which suggests that the film is inspired by a short story called "Quantum of Solace" by Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond. However, it does not imply that the film is a direct adaptation or continuation of the original Bond series.  The correct statement should be: "The 22nd James Bond film is Quantum of Solace."  The reason for this is that the premise states that the film is inspired by a short story called "Quantum of Solace", but it does not imply that the film is a direct adaptation or continuation of the original Bond series. This is a common practice in the film industry, where a film is often inspired by a story, but it does not necessarily mean that the film is a direct sequel or a continuation of the original story.
1760598632	1760598633	Premise: The gastric bypass operation, also known as stomach stapling, has become the most common surgical procedure for treating obesity.  Hypothesis: Obesity is medically treated.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that gastric bypass surgery is the most common surgical procedure for treating obesity, but it does not provide sufficient information to support the conclusion that obesity is medically treated.   To develop a hypothesis that follows from the premise, you would need to specify what is meant by "medically treated." For example, "Gastric bypass surgery is most commonly used for medically treated obesity."
1760598633	1760598633	Premise: The cost of the consumer of the United States fell in June.  Hypothesis: U.S. consumer spending dived in June.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	To determine if the hypothesis follows from the premise, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.  The premise states that the cost of the consumer of the United States fell in June.   The hypothesis states that the cost of the consumer of the United States dived in June.  The key difference between these two statements is the word "fell" in the premise. "Fell" typically implies a decrease in value or amount, whereas "dived" implies a more significant or dramatic decrease, such as a plunge or a sharp drop.  Since the premise states that the cost of the consumer fell, it implies a decrease in value, whereas the hypothesis states that the cost of the consumer dived in June, which implies a more significant decrease.  Therefore, the premise and hypothesis do not necessarily follow from each other. The premise does not necessarily imply that the cost of the consumer dived in June, as the word "fell" is used to describe a decrease in value, not a more significant drop.
1760598633	1760598634	Premise: The former leader of Iraq was rushed to hospital last Sunday after refusing to eat for sixteen days. But according to news agencies, he has ended the hunger strike by eating lunch at the court in Baghdad. "Saddam ate beef and rice and cola with bread which he brought from hospital," one source told Reuters news agency. He was fasting with three co-defendants, and they were demanding more security for their defence lawyers, three of whom have been murdered.  Hypothesis: Some Australians have fasted to protest.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise describes Saddam Hussein, the former leader of Iraq, eating a meal in court, which suggests that he is alive and not on hunger strike. This information is not relevant to the hypothesis, which claims that some Australians fasted to protest. The premise only provides information about Saddam Hussein's physical condition, not about any protests or actions of Australians.
1760598634	1760598634	Premise: Sonia Gandhi can be defeated in the next elections in India by BJP.  Hypothesis: Sonia Gandhi is defeated by BJP.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise states that Sonia Gandhi can be defeated in the next elections in India by BJP.   The term "can" is a modal verb. In a conditional statement, the modal verbs "can," "could," or "might" are used to express possibilities or likelihood. In this case, the premise states a "can" condition, which means that Sonia Gandhi can be defeated by BJP.  The hypothesis states that Sonia Gandhi is defeated by BJP. This is a conditional statement that assumes the premise is true. If the premise is true, it is a sufficient condition for the hypothesis to be true.
1760598634	1760598635	Premise: Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has said that Mahmoud Abbas is a man that Israel can do business with.  Hypothesis: Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, may be someone Israel can talk with.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis that "Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, may be someone Israel can talk with" does not follow from the premise "Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has said that Mahmoud Abbas is a man that Israel can do business with."  The premise states that Abbas is a man that Israel can do business with, but it does not imply that Abbas is a person that Israel can talk with. This is a causal relationship, where the premise establishes a connection between a political leader and a country's ability to do business with another country, but not necessarily between the leader and another person.  In order for the hypothesis to be true, we would need more information about the nature of the relationship between Abbas and Israel. For example, it could be that Abbas is a diplomat, a politician, or a public figure, and Israel is interested in engaging in dialogue or trade with him.  Therefore, the premise provides a causal link between the ability to do business and the relationship to a person, but not a causal link between the person and the ability to talk.
1760598635	1760598635	Premise: The Tempe Hometown Premiere will have all the trappings of a mega-Hollywood  event including red carpet arrivals, klieg lights, screaming fans, paparazzi and  media coverage of the film`s stars headed by Wolverine himself, Hugh Jackman and  including Liev Schreiber, Ryan Reynolds, Taylor Kitsch, Lynn Collins, will.i.am  and director Gavin Hood.  Following a hard-fought contest stretching over thousands of cities and towns  across the United States, Tempe emerged triumphant in a far-reaching, citywide  bid to nab the gala event. Mayor Hugh Hallman himself rallied the community,  which stepped up with dozens of videos that were posted on YouTube.  Hypothesis: Hugh Jackman plays the role of Wolverine in the movie.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise describes an event called "The Tempe Hometown Premiere" but does not mention Wolverine. The premise mentions Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, Ryan Reynolds, Taylor Kitsch, Lynn Collins, and i.am, but does not mention Wolverine at all. The text does not establish a connection between these actors and the premise.
1760598635	1760598635	Premise: In October, however, amid rising tensions between the government and opposition groups, a car bomb seriously injured an opposition politician and killed his driver, in Beirut.  Hypothesis: A member of the opposition was injured in a car bomb attack in Beirut.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that "a car bomb seriously injured an opposition politician and killed his driver," which implies that the car bomb was used to harm a person from the opposition, but it does not directly state that the opposition is the perpetrator of the attack. The premise does not provide any information about the motivations or actions of the perpetrator.  A correct hypothesis would need to make a specific claim about the perpetrator or their actions, such as "The opposition was responsible for the car bomb attack in Beirut." In this case, the hypothesis would follow from the premise.
1760598635	1760598637	Premise: Weinstock painstakingly reviewed dozens of studies for evidence of any link between sunscreen use and either an increase or decrease in melanoma.  Hypothesis: skin cancer numbers increase.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This is a classic example of a causal inference problem in epidemiology. The premise is that we have a study that reviews numerous studies on the relationship between sunscreen use and melanoma, and the hypothesis is that there is a link between the two.  The hypothesis that skin cancer numbers increase is a plausible one, as some studies have suggested that exposure to UV radiation from the sun, which is a major risk factor for melanoma, may be associated with an increased risk of skin cancer. However, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise in several ways:  1. **Correlation does not imply causation**: Just because sunscreen use is associated with an increased risk of melanoma in some studies, it does not mean that sunscreen use causes melanoma. Other factors, such as genetic predisposition, genetic variations, or environmental factors, may also contribute to the increased risk. 2. **Selection bias**: Studies on sunscreen use and melanoma may be biased towards individuals who are more likely to use sunscreen, which may not be representative of the general population. 3. **Confounding variables**: Other factors, such as age, skin type, and fair skin, may influence both sunscreen use and melanoma risk, which can make it difficult to isolate the effect of sunscreen use. 4. **Reverse causation**: It's possible that melanoma is a marker for other underlying health conditions that also lead to increased sunscreen use, which in turn leads to an association between sunscreen use and melanoma.  Therefore, while the premise provides some evidence for an association between sunscreen use and melanoma risk, the hypothesis that skin cancer numbers increase is not supported by a causal relationship.
1760598637	1760598637	Premise: Most people are familiar with the idea of St. Bernards or other dogs taking part in rescue and recovery efforts. Robots might also take part in search and rescue missions.  Hypothesis: Robots are used to find missing victims.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis that robots are used to find missing victims does follow from the premise that most people are familiar with the idea of St. Bernards or other dogs taking part in rescue and recovery efforts.  The premise establishes that robots are typically used in search and rescue efforts, which implies that they are capable of operating in environments where human search and rescue operations take place. This includes search and rescue missions where robots can be used to locate missing individuals or objects.  Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is a cause-and-effect one. The premise establishes a common scenario where robots are used in search and rescue efforts, and the hypothesis assumes that this is the primary method used to find missing victims, which is a logical consequence of the premise.
1760598637	1760598637	Premise: Illinois born Charlton Heston was a 27-year-old actor from Broadway and television when he arrived in Hollywood for a five-picture contract with Hal Wallis.  Hypothesis: Charlton Heston was born in Illinois.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Charlton Heston was born in Illinois. This means that the premise is a statement of fact about Charlton Heston's birthplace. The hypothesis is a statement that follows logically from the premise, as it is based on the same information.  In other words, the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise. If Charlton Heston was indeed born in Illinois, then it is reasonable to expect that he was born in Illinois.
1760598637	1760598638	Premise: Ruth's 1927 single season record of 60 home runs stood unsurpassed until Roger Maris hit 61 in 1961.  Hypothesis: Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs in his lifetime.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	To determine if the hypothesis follows from the premise, let's break down the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis:  Premise: Ruth's 1927 single-season record of 60 home runs stood unsurpassed until Roger Maris hit 61 in 1961.  Hypothesis: Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs in his lifetime.  The premise directly states that Ruth's single-season record of 60 home runs stood unsurpassed, which means that the hypothesis is that Babe Ruth's lifetime record is 60 home runs.   Since the premise directly implies that Ruth's single-season record of 60 home runs is the highest ever recorded by him, the hypothesis that he hit 60 home runs in his lifetime is a direct consequence of the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  This is an example of a syllogism:  Premise: S (Ruth's single-season record of 60 home runs stood unsurpassed) Hypothesis: P (Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs in his lifetime) Conclusion: Q (Therefore, P is true)  The conclusion logically follows from the premises.
1760598638	1760598639	Premise: The German technology was employed to build Shanghai's existing maglev line, the first in the world to be used commercially.  Hypothesis: Maglev is commercially used.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the German technology was employed to build Shanghai's existing maglev line, but it does not necessarily mean that the technology was used to build the line. Maglev technology is a type of transportation system, and its implementation can be in various forms (e.g., magnetic levitation, electromagnetic propulsion, or electromagnetic suspension). The fact that the premise refers to Shanghai's existing maglev line does not provide sufficient information to conclude that the technology was used to build it.  To make the hypothesis follow from the premise, additional information would be needed, such as that the technology was specifically designed and implemented for the maglev line, or that it was a unique application of the technology in Shanghai's maglev system.
1760598639	1760598639	Premise: SEATTLE — United Nations gang leader Clay Roueche should spend at least 30 years behind bars after his surprise guilty plea here Tuesday for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine, marijuana and illicit drug profits, U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Sullivan said. Sullivan said outside court that Roueche's leadership of the violent UN gang and the sophistication of the international drug conspiracy will all be factors used to argue for a longer sentence — up to life — for the 33-year-old Canadian. And he stressed that the plea agreement reached with Roueche did not include "any kind of break with respect to sentencing.".  Hypothesis: Clay Roueche is 33 years old.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that Clay Roueche is 33 years old, but it does not provide any information about how old he is at the time of the crime (conspiracy to smuggle cocaine, marijuana, and illicit drug profits). The premise does not mention anything about his age at the time of the crime, only that he is 33 years old. Therefore, it is impossible to deduce his age from the premise.
1760598639	1760598640	Premise: Baker's voice will replace the earlier computer-synthesized voice that was previously used. BT said that his voice was chosen as it was instantly recognisable. It took him 11 days to record 11,593 phrases and sounds which could then be broken down and reassembled by a computer to make new words. It then took five months to process these recordings to make a workable service. BT have said that there will be no barriers as to what Tom Baker's voice can 'say', including rude words. "What appeals to me most is the thought that I will be bringing good news to people whether it is a cheeky message, a birthday greeting, or just a quick hello," said Baker.  Hypothesis: Tom Baker works for BT.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This hypothesis follows from the premise because it is stated that Baker's voice was chosen as it was instantly recognizable. This implies that Baker's voice is the original voice used for the recordings, and that he is the one who will be using it to deliver the service.  The premise explicitly states that Baker's voice was chosen because it is instantly recognizable, which suggests that it is his original voice. This supports the hypothesis that Baker works for BT, as it is implied that he is the one using his original voice to deliver the service.  Additionally, the fact that the service can be made to say rude words is not relevant to the premise, which focuses on the fact that Baker's voice is the original one being used.
1760598640	1760598640	Premise: The Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for the selection of the candidates and the choice of Prize Winners for the Peace Prize. The Committee is composed of five members appointed by the Storting (Norwegian parliament). The Peace Prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway and not in Stockholm, Sweden like the other Nobel Prizes.  Hypothesis: Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis that Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen does not follow from the premise.   The premise mentions that the Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for the selection of the candidates and the choice of Prize Winners for the Peace Prize. This implies that the Committee's selection process is the one that decides which candidates are chosen for the Peace Prize.   However, the premise does not guarantee that the Committee's selection process is the one that decides which candidates are chosen for the Peace Prize. It only states that the Committee is responsible for the selection, but it does not specify the criteria for selecting the candidates. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the Committee's selection process is the one that decides which candidates are chosen for the Peace Prize.
1760598640	1760598641	Premise: More than 150 dolphins, marine turtles and beaked whales have been washed up dead on beaches in Africa.  Hypothesis: Dead dolphins, turtles and whales have been found on African beaches.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This hypothesis follows from the premise. Here's why:  The premise states that "More than 150 dolphins, marine turtles and beaked whales have been washed up dead on beaches in Africa."   If we consider the possible explanations for this phenomenon, the hypothesis can be tested:  1. **Habitat destruction**: Human activities such as overfishing, pollution, and coastal development could lead to habitat destruction, causing marine life to be washed ashore.  2. **Climate change**: Climate change can also contribute to habitat destruction, as rising sea levels and increased storm intensity may cause coastal erosion and flooding, leading to marine life being washed ashore.  3. **Pollution**: Marine pollution can also cause dead marine life to wash ashore.  4. **Entanglement in fishing gear**: Entanglement in fishing gear, such as nets and lines, can also cause marine life to be washed ashore.  5. **Accidental transport**: Accidental transport of dead marine life from their natural habitats to beaches can also occur.  Given the various factors that could contribute to the phenomenon, it is reasonable to assume that the premise could be true, and the hypothesis follows from it.
