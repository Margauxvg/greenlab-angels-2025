1760484601	1760484602	Premise: No Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq Yet.  Hypothesis: Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"This is a classic example of a syllogism with a fallacy.  The premise states that ""No Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq Yet."" This is a declarative statement that asserts a fact about Iraq.  The hypothesis states that ""Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq."" This is also a declarative statement that asserts a fact about Iraq.  However, the two statements are not equivalent, and the premise does not necessarily imply the hypothesis. The premise simply states that no weapons of mass destruction have been found in Iraq, whereas the hypothesis is a claim that these weapons have been found.  In other words, the premise is a negative statement, and the hypothesis is a positive statement. This is a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent, which is a type of syllogism.  To follow the correct logical structure, the hypothesis should be a negation of the premise, not a confirmation. The corrected hypothesis should be ""No Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq Yet."""	206
1760484602	1760484603	Premise: A place of sorrow, after Pope John Paul II died, became a place of celebration, as Roman Catholic faithful gathered in downtown Chicago to mark the installation of new Pope Benedict XVI.  Hypothesis: Pope Benedict XVI is the new leader of the Roman Catholic Church.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis follows from the premise. Here's why:  1. The premise states that after Pope John Paul II died, a place of sorrow turned into a place of celebration. This implies that the death of John Paul II was a significant event, likely a loss for the Catholic community. 2. The premise also states that the place where the celebration took place was in downtown Chicago. 3. The hypothesis assumes that the celebration was due to Pope Benedict XVI being the new leader of the Roman Catholic Church. Given that Pope John Paul II was the Pope at the time of his death, it's likely that his death led to a significant change in the leadership of the Church.  Therefore, the premise provides a clear link between the event (the death of Pope John Paul II) and the outcome (Pope Benedict XVI becoming the new leader of the Roman Catholic Church). This logical sequence supports the hypothesis.	185
1760484603	1760484603	Premise: Herceptin was already approved to treat the sickest breast cancer patients, and the company said, Monday, it will discuss with federal regulators the possibility of prescribing the drug for more breast cancer patients.  Hypothesis: Herceptin can be used to treat breast cancer.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Herceptin is already approved for treating the sickest breast cancer patients, but it does not provide information about its mechanism of action or its effectiveness in treating breast cancer.  The hypothesis states that Herceptin can be used to treat breast cancer, but it does not provide any information about its mechanism of action, which is a crucial aspect of cancer treatment.   Therefore, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is not direct. The premise provides some information about the drug's availability, but it does not provide enough information to make a logical conclusion about its effectiveness or mechanism of action.	135
1760484603	1760484603	Premise: Judie Vivian, chief executive at ProMedica, a medical service company that helps sustain the 2-year-old Vietnam Heart Institute in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), said that so far about 1,500 children have received treatment.  Hypothesis: The previous name of Ho Chi Minh City was Saigon.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Judie Vivian is the chief executive at ProMedica, but it does not mention anything about the previous name of Ho Chi Minh City. The premise only mentions that the medical service company is called ProMedica, and that Judie Vivian is the chief executive of the company. Therefore, we cannot infer that the previous name of Ho Chi Minh City was Saigon.	93
1760484603	1760484604	Premise: A man is due in court later charged with the murder 26 years ago of a teenager whose case was the first to be featured on BBC One's Crimewatch. Colette Aram, 16, was walking to her boyfriend's house in Keyworth, Nottinghamshire, on 30 October 1983 when she disappeared. Her body was later found in a field close to her home. Paul Stewart Hutchinson, 50, has been charged with murder and is due before Nottingham magistrates later.  Hypothesis: Paul Stewart Hutchinson is accused of having stabbed a girl.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Colette Aram, 16, was walking to her boyfriend's house in Keyworth, Nottinghamshire, on 30 October 1983 when she disappeared. This information is presented as a fact, but it does not necessarily imply that Colette Aram was murdered. In fact, the premise provides no information about the cause of her disappearance or the circumstances surrounding it.  To establish the hypothesis that Paul Stewart Hutchinson is accused of having stabbed Colette Aram, we would need more information. The premise only mentions that Paul Stewart Hutchinson is accused of murder and is due in court, but it does not provide any evidence or context that links him to the crime.	151
1760484604	1760484604	Premise: Britain said, Friday, that it has barred cleric, Omar Bakri, from returning to the country from Lebanon, where he was released by police after being detained for 24 hours.  Hypothesis: Bakri was briefly detained, but was released.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"The hypothesis ""Omar Bakri was briefly detained, but was released"" does not necessarily follow from the premise ""Britain said, Friday, that it has barred cleric, Omar Bakri, from returning to the country from Lebanon.""  The premise only mentions that Bakri was detained by the police in Lebanon, but it does not explicitly state that he was released. It also does not provide any information about why he was detained or what happened to him after he was released.  Therefore, the hypothesis is not necessarily true based on the premise alone."	111
1760484604	1760484605	Premise: Nearly 4 million children who have at least one parent who entered the U.S. illegally were born in the United States and are U.S. citizens as a result, according to the study conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center. That's about three quarters of the estimated 5.5 million children of illegal immigrants inside the United States, according to the study. About 1.8 million children of undocumented immigrants live in poverty, the study found.  Hypothesis: Three quarters of U.S. illegal immigrants have children.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise is that nearly 4 million children who have at least one parent who entered the U.S. illegally were born in the United States and are U.S. citizens as a result. This premise is not directly related to the number of children of illegal immigrants who live in poverty.  The premise does mention that nearly 3/4 of the children of illegal immigrants are U.S. citizens, but it does not explain why these children are U.S. citizens or why they are living in poverty.  To test the hypothesis, additional information is needed to understand the relationship between the number of children of illegal immigrants and their poverty status. For example, what is the relationship between the number of children of illegal immigrants and their poverty status?	161
1760484605	1760484606	Premise: Like the United States, U.N. officials are also dismayed that Aristide killed a conference called by Prime Minister Robert Malval in Port-au-Prince in hopes of bringing all the feuding parties together.  Hypothesis: Aristide had Prime Minister Robert Malval  murdered in Port-au-Prince.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Aristide killed a conference called by Prime Minister Robert Malval in Port-au-Prince, but it does not provide any information about the reason for the conference or the motivations behind Aristide's actions. In fact, the premise only mentions that the conference was called by Malval, but it does not imply that Aristide was involved in the conference or that he was responsible for its cancellation.  To make the hypothesis follow from the premise, the premise would need to provide more context or information about why Aristide killed the conference, such as to prevent a conflict or to silence critics. Without this additional information, the hypothesis remains speculative and lacks a clear connection to the premise.  In other words, the premise only provides a general statement about Aristide's actions, but it does not provide any evidence or reason why Aristide would be responsible for the cancellation of the conference.	190
1760484606	1760484606	Premise: WASHINGTON --  A newly declassified narrative of the Bush administration's advice to the CIA on harsh interrogations shows that the small group of Justice Department lawyers who wrote memos authorizing controversial interrogation techniques were operating not on their own but with direction from top administration officials, including then-Vice President Dick Cheney and national security adviser Condoleezza Rice. At the same time, the narrative suggests that then-Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and then-Secretary of State Colin Powell were largely left out of the decision-making process.  Hypothesis: Dick Cheney was the Vice President of Bush.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"The hypothesis ""Dick Cheney was the Vice President of Bush"" follows from the premise.   The premise states that the small group of Justice Department lawyers who wrote memos authorizing the interrogation techniques were operating not on their own but with direction from top administration officials, including then-Vice President Dick Cheney and national security adviser Condoleezza Rice. This implies that the Vice President and the national security adviser played a key role in the decision-making process, and that Dick Cheney was involved in the decision to authorize the interrogation techniques.   Therefore, the hypothesis that Dick Cheney was the Vice President of Bush can be logically derived from the premise."	128
1760484606	1760484606	Premise: Only a week after it had no comment on upping the storage capacity of its Hotmail e-mail service, Microsoft early Thursday announced it was boosting the allowance to 250MB to follow similar moves by rivals such as Google, Yahoo, and Lycos.  Hypothesis: Microsoft's Hotmail has raised its storage capacity to 250MB.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This hypothesis follows from the premise because the premise states that Microsoft is boosting its storage capacity to 250MB, which is a consequence of the action described in the premise. The hypothesis states that the action (boosting storage capacity) leads to a consequence (raising the storage capacity to 250MB). This is a classic example of a cause-and-effect relationship, where the premise sets up a chain of events leading to a specific outcome (250MB).	91
1760484606	1760484607	Premise: Lina Joy, 42, was born Azlina Jailani to Malay parents, and was raised as a Muslim. Malaysia's constitution guarantees freedom of religion, but by law, all ethnic Malays are Muslim. Joy converted to Christianity at age 26, and after some bureaucratic difficulties had her named legally changed in 1999. However, on her MyKad national ID, the National Registration Department retained her stated religion as Islam. In order to have her religion changed, the National Registration Department said Joy would have to obtain a certificate of apostasy from the Muslim Sharia Court.  Hypothesis: Lina Joy's parents are from Malaysia.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Lina Joy was raised as a Muslim, but it does not provide any information about her parents. The premise only mentions that Malaysia's constitution guarantees freedom of religion, but this does not necessarily imply that Joy's parents are Muslims. It could be the case that Lina Joy's parents are not Muslims, or that they have changed their religion. The premise does not provide any information about the ethnic background of Lina Joy's parents.	104
1760484607	1760484607	Premise: November 9, 1989 , the day the Berlin Wall fell and the world changed forever . Not even the most astute saw it coming . As Hungary's foreign minister in the late summer of 1989 , Gyula Horn gave the order to let visiting East Germans use his country to do a 400-mile end run around the Berlin Wall , a move now seen as the beginning of the end for hard-line communism in Europe .  Hypothesis: The Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This hypothesis follows from the premise. Here's why:  The premise states that November 9, 1989, marked the day the Berlin Wall fell, and not even the most astute saw it coming. This implies that the fall of the Berlin Wall was a significant event that occurred without being anticipated or expected by anyone.  The hypothesis suggests that the Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989, which is a consequence of the premise. The premise implies that the fall of the Berlin Wall was a pivotal moment in history, and the hypothesis logically follows from this statement.  In other words, the premise provides a cause (the fall of the Berlin Wall) and the consequence (the tearing down of the Berlin Wall), and the hypothesis identifies a specific event that is implied by the premise.	161
1760484607	1760484608	"Premise: Valero Energy Corp., on Monday, said it found ""extensive"" additional damage at its 250,000-barrel-per-day Port Arthur refinery.  Hypothesis: Valero Energy Corp. produces 250,000 barrels per day.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"The hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that Valero Energy Corp. found ""extensive"" damage at its 250,000-barrel-per-day refinery, but it does not provide any information about the amount of damage or the rate of damage. The premise only mentions that there is damage, but does not specify how extensive it is.  To make a hypothesis, we would need more information, such as the rate at which the damage is occurring or the amount of damage that has been done. Without this information, we cannot conclude that there is extensive damage at the refinery."	121
1760484608	1760484608	Premise: Oil prices fall back as Yukos oil threat lifted  Hypothesis: Oil prices rise.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that the ""Oil prices fall back"" while the hypothesis states that ""Oil prices rise."" The premise suggests a decrease in oil prices, which contradicts the hypothesis."	49
1760484608	1760484608	Premise: Brian Brohm, the Louisville quarterback, threw for 368 yards and five touchdowns as the Cardinals beat visiting Oregon State 63-27.  Hypothesis: The quarterback threw for 413 yards and three touchdowns, and then ran to the end zone two more times.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	To determine if the hypothesis follows from the premise, we need to analyze the information given:  Premise: Brian Brohm, the Louisville quarterback, threw for 368 yards and five touchdowns as the Cardinals beat visiting Oregon State 63-27.  Hypothesis: The quarterback threw for 413 yards and three touchdowns, and then ran to the end zone two more times.  The premise directly states that the quarterback threw for 368 yards and five touchdowns. This means the quarterback threw a total of 368 yards and 5 touchdowns.  The hypothesis states that the quarterback threw 413 yards and 3 touchdowns. This is not directly related to the premise.   Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.	148
1760484608	1760484609	"Premise: Greg Page, a former heavyweight boxing champion who suffered a severe brain injury in a 2001 fight, has died at 50. His wife Patricia said the one-time WBA champion had died at his home in Kentucky, USA, of complications related to injuries he suffered in the fight. Page was in a coma for a week after the 9 March 2001 fight against Dale Crowe which was stopped in the 10th round. Patricia Page said he was ""in a better place now"" after announcing on Monday he had died overnight in his sleep.  Hypothesis: Greg Page was a WBA champion.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"The hypothesis ""Greg Page was a WBA champion"" does not necessarily follow from the premise.  The premise simply states that Greg Page suffered a brain injury in a fight and died at 50. It does not provide any information about his profession, occupation, or any notable achievements outside of boxing. There is no indication that Page was a professional boxer or held any other titles outside of the WBA.  Therefore, the hypothesis is unfounded and does not logically follow from the premise."	99
1760484609	1760484609	"Premise: Sierra is likely to remain in jail at the Hillsborough County jail in her native Tampa until her next hearing on December 20, where she is being held without bail, which would prevent her attending the Washington event on Friday even if she still had permission to perform. Sierra has been in jail since the start of the month after an altercation with police officers outside a Tampa nightclub, which she had been ejected from. She is charged with disorderly intoxication and resisting arrest.  Hypothesis: Sierra once reached the finals of ""American Idol"".  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise is about Sierra being held in jail and facing a hearing on December 20, but it does not provide any information about her participation in the American Idol competition. The premise only mentions that she is being held in jail due to a police altercation, and does not mention her performance on the show. Therefore, it is not possible to infer that she would have been able to attend the event if she had been allowed to perform.	100
1760484609	1760484609	Premise: Since 1987, however, Brazil has taken steps to dramatically reduce the destruction, including stepped-up enforcement and the elimination of tax incentives that led to large-scale land clearing.  Hypothesis: In the early 1990s Brazil began to take action to save the rainforest.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that since 1987, Brazil has taken steps to reduce the destruction of the rainforest, but it does not specify what those steps are. It only mentions that steps have been taken, but it does not describe what those steps are. Therefore, we cannot infer what the hypothesis is based on this premise.   The hypothesis should be supported by more information about the actions taken by Brazil in the 1990s to save the rainforest.	105
1760484609	1760484610	"Premise: FIFA has received 11 bids to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments, an international football competition contested by the men's national teams. The countries vying to host the tournament are Australia, England, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Qatar, Russia, South Korea and United States, who have individual bids and the joint bids are from Belgium-Netherlands and Spain-Portugal.  Select bids are for 2018 and 2022 tournaments and two bids are just for the 2022 tournament. Qatar and South Korea are vying just for the 2022 tournament. The two winning bids will be chosen on December 2010 by the 24-man executive committee of FIFA.  Said FIFA president Sepp Blatter: ""We are very pleased about the fantastic level of interest in our flagship competition, with all initial bidders confirming their candidature.""  Hypothesis: Sepp Blatter is the president of FIFA.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that FIFA has received bids for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments, but it does not state that the winning bids for the 2018 tournament were chosen by the 24-man executive committee of FIFA. In fact, the premise only mentions that two bids are for the 2022 tournament, with Qatar and South Korea vying for that tournament.  Therefore, the hypothesis that Sepp Blatter is the president of FIFA cannot be inferred from the premise.	113
1760484610	1760484611	Premise: U.S. crude settled $1.32 lower at $42.83 a barrel.  Hypothesis: Crude the light American lowered to the closing 1.32 dollars, to 42.83 dollars the barrel.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis and premise are related but not equivalent.  The premise states that crude settled at $1.32 lower than the closing price of $42.83, but the hypothesis states that crude settled at $1.32 lower than the closing price of $42.83.  This difference in phrasing means the hypothesis is not a direct consequence of the premise. The premise simply states a condition (crude settled at $1.32 lower), while the hypothesis states the consequence of that condition (crude settled at $1.32 lower than the closing price).  In other words, the premise does not imply that if crude settled at $1.32 lower, it would have the same price of $42.83. The premise only states a relationship between two values, but does not establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the premise.	183
1760484611	1760484611	Premise: WINNENDEN, Germany ―A teenage gunman killed 15 people, most of them female, on Wednesday in a rampage that began at a school near Stuttgart in southern Germany and ended in a nearby town, where he then killed himself after the police wounded him. The attack left Germany, which tightened tough gun controls after a similar attack at a school seven years ago, struggling to understand the carnage that had again befallen it, a country with relatively little violent crime. In 2002, a gunman killed 16 people before killing himself at a school in Erfurt, in eastern Germany.  Hypothesis: In 2002 near Stuttgart a boy shot 16 people.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"This hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise mentions a ""teenage gunman"" killed 15 people, but it does not specify that the gunman was a boy. The fact that the person was a boy does not provide any information about their age, and therefore, it cannot be inferred that the hypothesis follows from the premise."	69
1760484611	1760484611	Premise: Many hopes are riding on the sale of Talisman's holdings in Palm Beach and Hendry counties, which Vice President Al Gore announced with much fanfare last year at the 50th anniversary of Everglades National Park.  Hypothesis: Everglades National Park is located in Florida.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This hypothesis follows from the premise because the premise mentions that Vice President Al Gore announced the sale of Talisman's holdings in Palm Beach and Hendry counties. This implies that Vice President Gore is associated with the Everglades National Park.	48
1760484611	1760484611	Premise: Rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy and ultimately death. Early symptoms of rabies in humans are nonspecific, consisting of fever, headache, and general malaise.  Hypothesis: Rabies is fatal in humans.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the premise.   The premise states that rabies virus infects the central nervous system and causes encephalopathy and ultimately death. However, the premise does not mention anything about the symptoms of the disease in humans.  The symptoms mentioned in the premise are fever, headache, and general malaise, which are nonspecific and can be caused by a wide range of conditions, not just rabies. Therefore, it is not clear whether the hypothesis that rabies is fatal in humans is supported by the premise.	111
1760484611	1760484612	Premise: American tobacco companies were showing a profit most quarters due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products sold including food.  Hypothesis: PM often entered markets with both cigarettes and food.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"This is a classic example of a null-hypothesis vs. alternative hypothesis problem in hypothesis testing.  The premise is: American tobacco companies were showing a profit most quarters due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products sold including food.  The null hypothesis (H0) is: PM did not enter markets with both cigarettes and food.  The alternative hypothesis (H1) is: PM did enter markets with both cigarettes and food.  To determine if the hypothesis follows from the premise, we need to evaluate the relationship between the premise and the alternative hypothesis.  The premise states that tobacco companies are showing a profit due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products including food. This suggests that the presence of both cigarettes and food products is associated with profitability.  However, the alternative hypothesis states that tobacco companies did not enter markets with both cigarettes and food. This implies that the presence of both is not associated with profitability.  In this case, the premise provides evidence against the alternative hypothesis, as it suggests that the presence of both cigarettes and food is associated with profitability. Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  In other words, the premise provides sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which is the opposite of what the hypothesis states. This is known as a ""rejection of the null hypothesis"" or ""supporting the alternative hypothesis""."	278
1760484612	1760484613	Premise: The development of agriculture by early humans, roughly 10,000 years ago, was also harmful to many natural ecosystems as they were systematically destroyed and replaced with artificial versions.  Hypothesis: Humans existed 10,000 years ago.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that agriculture was developed by early humans, roughly 10,000 years ago, which implies that the development of agriculture was the cause of the harm to natural ecosystems. However, it is not necessary for the development of agriculture to be the cause of the harm.  Instead, the premise suggests that agriculture was introduced and replaced natural ecosystems, not that it was the cause of the harm. The harm referred to in the premise likely refers to the over-exploitation and degradation of natural resources, such as forests, water sources, and wildlife habitats, as a result of the introduction of agriculture.  Therefore, the hypothesis that humans existed 10,000 years ago is actually a consequence of the premise, not the premise itself.	160
1760484613	1760484613	Premise: The two young leaders of the coup, Pibul Songgram and Pridi Phanomyang, both educated in Europe and influenced by Western ideas, came to dominate Thai politics in the ensuing years.  Hypothesis: Pibul was a young leader.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows logically from the premise. The premise states that the two young leaders, Pibul Songgram and Pridi Phanomyang, came to dominate Thai politics, implying that they were influential and had significant power. This suggests that Pibul was a young leader, as the premise is describing their rise to power, not their age.  In other words, the premise sets up a causal relationship between the leaders' age and their influence, which is what the hypothesis is trying to explain. Therefore, the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise, making it a valid argument.	124
1760484613	1760484614	"Premise: Lin Piao, after all, was the creator of Mao's ""Little Red Book"" of quotations.  Hypothesis: Lin Piao wrote the ""Little Red Book"".  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Lin Piao was the creator of Mao's ""Little Red Book"", which is a historical fact. Therefore, if Lin Piao indeed created the ""Little Red Book"", then it is reasonable to conclude that he wrote the ""Little Red Book"". This is an example of a deductive argument, where the premise provides a direct link to the conclusion."	85
1760484614	1760484615	Premise: When patients interrupt a course of antibiotics, the surviving bacteria return with a vengeance, often having rapidly mutated to resist the therapy.  Hypothesis: Bacteria is winning the war against antibiotics.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"The hypothesis that ""Bacteria is winning the war against antibiotics"" follows from the premise ""When patients interrupt a course of antibiotics, the surviving bacteria return with a vengeance, often having rapidly mutated to resist the therapy.""  Here's the argument:  1. The premise states that when patients interrupt a course of antibiotics, the surviving bacteria return with a vengeance, often having rapidly mutated to resist the therapy. 2. This implies that the bacteria that are exposed to antibiotics are not killed, but rather, they are able to survive and adapt to the presence of the antibiotic. 3. If the bacteria are able to survive and adapt to the presence of antibiotics, it suggests that the bacteria are more resilient than initially thought. 4. This resilience could be due to the fact that the bacteria have mutated to become resistant to the antibiotic, which is a characteristic known as ""antibiotic resistance."" 5. Therefore, the hypothesis that bacteria is winning the war against antibiotics is supported by the premise, as it implies that the bacteria are more resistant and adaptable than previously thought.  This is a classic example of a ""correlation does not imply causation,"" a type of fallacy in reasoning. The premise describes a correlation between the presence of antibiotics and the survival of bacteria, but it does not establish a causal link between the two. The hypothesis that bacteria is winning the war against antibiotics is not supported by this premise, and it is not a scientifically supported conclusion."	297
1760484615	1760484615	Premise: Initially the Bundesbank opposed the introduction of the euro but was compelled to accept it in light of the political pressure of the capitalist politicians who supported its introduction.  Hypothesis: The introduction of the euro has been opposed.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"The hypothesis ""The introduction of the euro has been opposed"" cannot be concluded from the premise ""The Bundesbank opposed the introduction of the euro.""   The premise states that the Bundesbank initially opposed the introduction of the euro, but this does not necessarily mean that it was opposed by all members of the Bundesbank. It only indicates that the Bundesbank opposed the introduction, but does not rule out the possibility that other members may have supported or been neutral on the issue.  In fact, the Bundesbank's opposition to the introduction of the euro was likely due to its fear of economic instability and the potential loss of monetary policy independence, rather than a blanket opposition to the euro."	137
1760484615	1760484615	Premise: The Armed Forces Press Committee (COPREFA) admitted that the government troops sustained 11 casualties in these clashes, adding that they inflicted three casualties on the rebels.  Hypothesis: Three rebels were killed by government troops.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that the Armed Forces Press Committee (COPREFA) admitted that the government troops sustained 11 casualties, but it does not provide any information about the number of casualties inflicted by the rebels.   Therefore, the hypothesis that three rebels were killed by government troops cannot be logically deduced from the premise.	77
1760484615	1760484616	Premise: One economic study will not be the basis of Canada's public policy decisions, but Easton's research does conclusively show that there are economic benefits in the legalization of marijuana.  Hypothesis: Drug legalization has benefits.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"The hypothesis ""Drug legalization has benefits"" does not follow from the premise ""One economic study will not be the basis of Canada's public policy decisions, but Easton's research does conclusively show that there are economic benefits in the legalization of marijuana.""  The premise is about the fact that a specific economic study (Easton's research) found that there are economic benefits in the legalization of marijuana, but it does not mention anything about the study's methodology, findings, or conclusions.   While it is true that the study's findings have been used to inform policy decisions, the premise does not establish causality. It only states that the study has been used as a basis for policy decisions, but it does not provide evidence that the policy decisions themselves were influenced by the study.   Therefore, the hypothesis that ""Drug legalization has benefits"" does not logically follow from the premise."	177
1760484616	1760484616	Premise: Archaeologists have found approximately 30 beautifully preserved mummies in a 4,000 year old Egyptian necropolis which held 53 tombs. Supervisor of Antiquities for Middle Egypt Dr. Abdel-Rahman El-Ayedi's team established his archaeological site in the Faiyum Oasis near the El-Lahun Egyptian pyramid which is just south of Cairo. Besides the mummies, the team found masks, amulets, clay pots and an offering table located in a funerary chapel. The chapel dates back to about 30 BC to 337 AD.  Hypothesis: 30 beautifully preserved mummies have been located in the south of Cairo.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that archaeologists found 30 beautifully preserved mummies in a 4,000-year-old Egyptian necropolis, but the location of the mummies is not specified. The premise does not provide any information about the location of the mummies, only that they are found in a necropolis in the Faiyum Oasis.  Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be deduced from the premise, as the location of the mummies is not specified.	102
1760484616	1760484617	Premise: Gastrointestinal bleeding can happen as an adverse effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin or ibuprofen.  Hypothesis: Aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that gastrointestinal bleeding can happen as an adverse effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen. This statement is a causal relationship, where the cause (NSAIDs) leads to a specific outcome (gastrointestinal bleeding).  However, the hypothesis that aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding is a prediction or a conclusion, not a cause. To follow from the premise, the hypothesis would need to explain why aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding. This is not explicitly stated in the premise.  A more accurate hypothesis might be: ""Aspirin reduces the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in individuals taking NSAIDs."" This hypothesis provides a clear explanation of why aspirin might prevent gastrointestinal bleeding, based on the premise that NSAIDs can cause it."	173
1760484617	1760484617	Premise: A former employee of the company, David Vance of South Portland, said Hooper spent a lot of time on the road, often meeting with customers between Portland and Kittery.  Hypothesis: Hooper is a citizen of Portland.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that Hooper spent a lot of time on the road, often meeting with customers between Portland and Kittery, but it does not provide any information about Hooper's nationality.  The fact that Hooper spent time on the road does not imply anything about his nationality. It could be that he is a citizen of any city, including Portland. Therefore, the hypothesis that Hooper is a citizen of Portland cannot be logically deduced from the premise.	104
1760484617	1760484618	Premise: Cyprus, divided or not, joins the EU on the 1st of May.  Hypothesis: Cyprus was divided into two parts on May 1.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise states that Cyprus is divided, which implies that Cyprus is not a single, unified entity. This statement is true, as Cyprus is indeed divided into two distinct parts: the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus (the internationally recognized government) and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (the self-declared government recognized only by Turkey).  If Cyprus is divided, then it follows that the hypothesis that it is divided into two parts is also true.	97
1760484618	1760484618	Premise: World leaders expressed concern on Thursday that North Korea will quit six-party nuclear disarmament talks and will  bolster its nuclear weapons arsenal.  Hypothesis: North Korea says it has a stockpile of nuclear weapons and is building more.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that North Korea will quit six-party nuclear disarmament talks, but it does not provide any information about North Korea's current nuclear capabilities or plans. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that North Korea will build more nuclear weapons based on this premise. The premise only indicates that North Korea is no longer participating in the talks, but it does not provide any information about its nuclear program or intentions.  To make a correct inference, we would need additional information about North Korea's current nuclear capabilities or plans, such as a statement from the North Korean government or a report from a credible source.	134
1760484618	1760484619	Premise: In addition to establishing the electoral commission, the laws also concern nationality, a contentious issue since citizenship laws were tightened to exclude one of Gbagbo's main competitors from the 2000 presidential race, former prime minister Alassane Ouattara.  Hypothesis: Gbagbo is a competitor of Ouattara.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"The hypothesis ""Gbagbo is a competitor of Ouattara"" does not follow from the premise ""In addition to establishing the electoral commission, the laws also concern nationality, a contentious issue since citizenship laws were tightened to exclude one of Gbagbo's main competitors from the 2000 presidential race, former prime minister Alassane Ouattara.""  The premise only mentions that the laws concern nationality and that one of Gbagbo's main competitors was excluded from the 2000 presidential race. It does not provide any information about Gbagbo's role or involvement in the election. Therefore, it is not possible to infer that Gbagbo is a competitor of Ouattara based on this premise.  A correct hypothesis would need to provide more context or information about Gbagbo's involvement in the election or their relationship with Ouattara to make a claim about their relationship."	180
1760484619	1760484619	Premise: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace Prize, though he was nominated for it five times between 1937 and 1948.  Hypothesis: Mohandas received the Nobel Prize in 1989.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize five times between 1937 and 1948. However, the Nobel Committee has not officially announced that Gandhi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  Therefore, the hypothesis that Gandhi received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 is not supported by the premise.	83
1760484619	1760484619	Premise: The Christian Democrats (CDU) won 35.2% of the vote, or 225 seats, against 34.3% for Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats (SPD).  Hypothesis: It seems unlikely that there will be a coalition between Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats and Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Christian Democrats (CDU) won 35.2% of the vote, or 225 seats, while the Social Democrats (SPD) won 34.3% of the vote, or 225 seats. This information is meant to describe the election results, not to predict the likelihood of a coalition between the two parties.  The hypothesis that the CDU and SPD will not form a coalition is not necessarily supported by this information. In fact, it is quite the opposite - the premise suggests that the CDU won a significant number of seats, which could be a factor that encourages coalition-building with the SPD.  Therefore, the hypothesis is incorrect.	151
1760484619	1760484620	Premise: Edward VIII became King in January of 1936 and abdicated in December.  Hypothesis: King Edward VIII abdicated in December 1936.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Edward VIII became King in January 1936, but it does not provide any information about the date he abdicated. The premise only specifies that he became King in January, but it does not specify the date of his abdication. Therefore, we cannot infer the date of his abdication from the premise.	82
1760484620	1760484620	"Premise: Australian Guantanamo Bay detainee David Hicks has won British citizenship, opening the door for a possible bid to have him freed from the US detention facility in Cuba. Justice Lawrence Collins of the British High Court has overturned the British Government's refusal of citizenship to Hicks, whose mother was born in England. Justice Collins said the Government had ""no power to withhold or deprive citizenship"". Justice Collins said: ""In my view it would be improper to fail to give assistance which otherwise would have been given, simply because the claimant was believed to be involved in terrorism and has not had any previous connection with this country."" Hicks' lawyer, Stephen Grosz, said the decision was a breakthrough. He said there was now no reason why Hicks should not enjoy the same protection as the nine other British citizens released without charge from Guantanamo Bay on representations of the British Government.  Hypothesis: Stephen Grosz is the British lawyer of David Hicks.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise. The premise states that Justice Lawrence Collins of the British High Court has overturned the British Government's refusal of citizenship to David Hicks. This means that the premise provides a reason why Justice Collins made a decision in favor of Hicks.  In other words, the premise establishes a connection between the British Government's decision to refuse citizenship and the court's decision in favor of Hicks. This establishes a causal relationship between the two events, suggesting that the premise is sufficient to infer the hypothesis.	104
1760484620	1760484621	Premise: Rockweed has been harvested commercially in Nova Scotia since the late 1950's and is currently the most important commercial seaweed in Atlantic Canada.  Hypothesis: Marine vegetation is  harvested.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis ""Marine vegetation is harvested"" does not necessarily follow from the premise ""Rockweed has been harvested commercially in Nova Scotia since the late 1950s.""  The premise suggests that Rockweed has been harvested commercially in Nova Scotia, but it does not provide information about the nature of the harvest (e.g. what type of harvesting method, quantity, or duration).   If we assume that the premise is true, we would need additional information to determine the type of harvesting, which is not provided. For example, it could be harvesting by hand, by machine, or by a combination of both, or it could be done for specific purposes such as food, oil, or biofuel. Without this additional information, we cannot make a specific hypothesis about the harvesting method.  Therefore, the hypothesis is too vague and does not follow logically from the premise."	177
1760484621	1760484621	Premise: Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has ordered security forces to take firm action against rioters following the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto. The violence has left at least 44 people dead and dozens injured. Mr. Musharraf insisted the measures were to protect people. VOA's Ayaz Gul reports from Islamabad that a bitter dispute has also erupted over how the 54-year-old politician died and who was behind her assassination.  Hypothesis: Musharraf has ordered rioters to take firm action against security forces.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise mentions that ""Premise: Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has ordered security forces to take firm action against rioters following the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto."" However, the hypothesis suggests that the action taken by Musharraf is directly related to the premise, which is the assassination of Benazir Bhutto. The premise does not mention the action taken by Musharraf, so the hypothesis is not logically connected to the premise."	106
1760484621	1760484622	"Premise: A month after Gov. David A. Paterson dropped his proposal for a soda tax, New York City's health commissioner has written an article advocating ""hefty"" taxes on sodas and sports drinks containing sugar. Such a tax, the article said, could be the biggest boon to public health since tobacco taxes. The commissioner, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, and Kelly D. Brownell of Yale University, his co-author, argue in the New England Journal of Medicine that a tax of a penny per ounce could reduce consumption by more than 10 percent and raise $1.2 billion a year in New York State alone.  Hypothesis: Michael Bloomberg is the mayor of New York.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that New York City's health commissioner, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, and Kelly D. Brownell of Yale University, have written an article advocating for a ""hefty"" tax on sodas and sports drinks containing sugar.   The hypothesis states that a tax of a penny per ounce could reduce consumption by more than 10 percent and raise $1.2 billion a year in New York State alone.   This is not a direct inference from the premise. The premise mentions Dr. Frieden and Yale University, but it does not establish a causal relationship between them or their actions. The premise provides a specific context for the idea of a tax on sodas and sports drinks, but it does not establish a causal link between the health commissioner and the proposed tax."	169
1760484622	1760484622	Premise: Officials said the Finnish suspect was among the dead but did not provide a motive for the attack.  Hypothesis: Officials said that the suspect, a Finnish citizen, was among the dead.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise. The premise simply states that the suspect was among the dead, but it does not provide any information about why the suspect was among the dead. The hypothesis states that the suspect was among the dead, which is a necessary condition for the hypothesis to be true. Therefore, we can logically conclude that the hypothesis follows from the premise.  In other words, the fact that the suspect was among the dead is sufficient to support the hypothesis that the suspect is dead, without providing any additional information. This is a classic example of a deductive argument, where the conclusion logically follows from the premises.	127
1760484622	1760484623	Premise: Britain agreed to lift by March 31 a 150-mile military protection zone enforced around the islands since Argentina invaded them in 1982.  Hypothesis: The military protection zone around Falklands was lifted.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Britain agreed to lift the military protection zone by March 31, 1983, which implies a specific date (March 31, 1983) after which the zone was to be lifted. The hypothesis states that the military protection zone was lifted, but it does not specify a specific date after which the zone was lifted.  In order for the hypothesis to be true, it would need to specify that the zone was lifted after March 31, 1983. Without this additional specification, the premise only provides a specific date, but not a specific date after which the zone was lifted. Therefore, the hypothesis is not necessarily true based on the premise alone.	151
1760484623	1760484623	"Premise: The ferry owner PT Nur Budi's spokesman blamed Indonesian port authorities for the tragedy. ""The passenger capacity of the ferry is 205 people but the port administrator accepted more passengers as they thought it was possible,"" he said. The National Meteorological and Geophysics Agency, however, had published and raised an alert signal about high waves on Friday. It specifically stated that ""Saturday 10th and Sunday 11th, Indonesian waters would have witnessed storm force waves,"" but despite the dire warnings KM Teratai set for the seas.  Hypothesis: An Indonesian ferry with 300 passengers sank.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that the ferry was carrying more passengers than its capacity, but it does not directly imply that the ferry sank. The premise does not provide any information about the number of passengers on board, only that the ferry was carrying more than its capacity.   Therefore, the premise does not provide sufficient information to make a logical conclusion about the hypothesis that the ferry sank.	86
1760484623	1760484623	Premise: Tension and battles between Greek police and anarchist demonstrators took place in the centre of Athens, Greece, during the anti-war demonstration of the 4th European Social Forum which is taking place in the Greek capital, from 4 to 7 of May 2006. The march of the approximately 1,000 anarchists ended with clashes between groups of anarchists and police. Riot police used tear gas, while a branch of a Greek bank, a fast-food store and around 50 shop windows in central Athens were damaged.  Hypothesis: The riots in Greece started on December 6.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the riots in Greece started on December 6, 2006. However, the premise does not provide any information about when the riots actually occurred, only that they took place in the centre of Athens from May 4 to 7, 2006. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the riots started on December 6.  To conclude that the riots started on December 6, we would need additional information, such as a specific event or date that occurred on or around December 6, 2006.	121
1760484623	1760484624	Premise: Libya's case against Britain and the US concerns the dispute over their demand for extradition of Libyans charged with blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in 1988.  Hypothesis: One case involved the extradition of Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Libya's case against Britain and the US concerns the dispute over their demand for extradition of Libyans charged with blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in 1988. This premise is incorrect because it only mentions Libya, not the United States.  The correct premise should include the US, as the United States was also involved in the dispute over the extradition of Libyans charged with the Lockerbie bombing. Therefore, the correct premise should be: ""Libya's case against Britain and the US concerns the dispute over their demand for extradition of Libyans charged with blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in 1988, alongside the US.""  With this corrected premise, the hypothesis that ""One case involved the extradition of Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing"" follows logically from the premise."	183
1760484624	1760484624	Premise: Argentina sought help from Britain on its privatization program and encouraged British investment.  Hypothesis: Argentina sought UK expertise on privatization and agriculture.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This statement does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Argentina sought help from Britain on its privatization program, but it does not explicitly state that the help came from Britain on the topic of agriculture. The premise only mentions the topic of privatization, without specifying the field of agriculture.   Therefore, the hypothesis that Argentina sought UK expertise on privatization and agriculture cannot be logically derived from the premise.	84
1760484624	1760484625	Premise: Instead of action on crime, we got the federal long gun registry, which became a bloated bureaucratic nightmare to responsible hunters, farmers and rural Canadians. It cost taxpayers some CA$2 billion and it hasn't done a thing to reduce gun crime. said Harper. The Conservatives have provided amnesty for unregistered gun owners. At this time there is no legislation set before the House of Commons. Conservative Garry Breitkreuz from Saskatchewan tabled the bill killing the long-gun registry.  Hypothesis: Garry Breitkreuz is a member of the Conservative Party.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise mentions that the federal long gun registry was implemented, which led to a bloated bureaucratic nightmare. However, it does not specify that the registry was implemented by the current government, specifically the Harper government. The premise does not provide information about who implemented the registry or the current government.  The hypothesis, which states that Garry Breitkreuz is a member of the Conservative Party, is also not supported by the premise. The premise only mentions that the Conservative Party tabled the bill to kill the long-gun registry, without specifying who was behind the bill or the government responsible for implementing it.	134
1760484625	1760484625	Premise: The researchers in the latest study fed one group of mice a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat. The diet started when the mice, all males, were 1 year old, which is middle-age in mouse longevity. As expected, the mice soon developed signs of impending diabetes, with grossly enlarged livers, and started to die much sooner than mice fed a standard diet.  Hypothesis: At the age of one year, male mice were fed with a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that the mice developed signs of impending diabetes with a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat. This suggests that the mice's bodies are not adapted to handle high-fat diets and are likely to develop health issues.  The hypothesis that male mice were fed a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat is a consequence of the premise. The premise implies that the mice's bodies are not adapted to handle high-fat diets, which would lead to the expected health issues. The hypothesis provides a specific example of how this consequence can occur, which is feeding the mice a diet with 60 percent of calories from fat.  In other words, the premise sets up a cause-and-effect relationship between the diet and the health issues, and the hypothesis provides a specific example of how that relationship can occur.	175
1760484625	1760484626	Premise: The soldiers, who were said to have been wearing Arab headdress, were accused of firing at Iraqi police when stopped at a road block.  Hypothesis: The soldiers were driving a civilian car and were dressed in civilian clothes when a shooting took place between them and Iraqi patrols.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the soldiers were wearing Arab headdress, but it does not provide any information about their attire or clothing. In fact, the premise only mentions that they were wearing Arab headdress, without specifying the type of headdress or whether it was worn at the time of the incident.  Without more information about the soldiers' attire, it is impossible to infer that they were driving a civilian car. The hypothesis is therefore unfounded and lacks a necessary condition for the premise to be true.  The correct hypothesis should include additional information that relates the attire to the driving of a civilian car.	131
1760484626	1760484626	"Premise: The United States would like to see U.N. weapons inspectors return to Iraq providing the Iraqis take concrete, affirmative and demonstrable actions ""to show full co-operation"" Clinton said.  Hypothesis: U.N. weapons inspectors could stay in Iraq, Clinton said.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the United States wants U.N. weapons inspectors to return to Iraq and take concrete, affirmative, and demonstrable actions ""to show full co-operation"". However, the premise does not provide any information about what those actions would be, or what would constitute ""affirmative and demonstrable"" actions.  To make the hypothesis follow from the premise, we would need additional information about what specific actions the Iraqis would need to take in order to be considered as ""affirmative and demonstrable""."	117
1760484626	1760484627	Premise: On 12 August, the San Carlos Battalion came across mines placed in their path and one soldier was killed while two were seriously injured. Meanwhile on 10 August, urban commandos took a patrol car by surprise and dropped a grenade inside the car, injuring four and partially destroying the vehicle.  Hypothesis: A patrol car was attacked by the San Carlos Battalion.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise mentions that the San Carlos Battalion came across mines placed in their path, which implies that they were trying to avoid an attack. However, the premise does not provide any information about the patrol car being attacked or being targeted by the San Carlos Battalion. Therefore, it is unclear what led to the patrol car being attacked, and it is not directly related to the San Carlos Battalion's actions.  The second part of the premise mentions urban commandos taking a patrol car by surprise and dropping a grenade, which is a separate event that is not connected to the premise about the San Carlos Battalion. These events are also not related to the premise's focus on the patrol car and the San Carlos Battalion.	153
1760484627	1760484627	Premise: Bomb-sniffing dogs were brought to Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment.  Hypothesis: Bomb-sniffing dogs were estimated at Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that ""Bomb-sniffing dogs were brought to Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment,"" but it does not state that the dogs were brought by Rodriguez. Therefore, we cannot infer that the hypothesis ""Bomb-sniffing dogs were estimated at Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment"" from the premise.  A correct inference would require the premise to also state that the dogs were brought to the apartment, which is not provided."	101
1760484627	1760484628	Premise: Startling new research into mobile phones claims they may reduce a man's sperm count by up to 30%.  Hypothesis: Male fertility may be affected by use of a mobile phones.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"The hypothesis ""Male fertility may be affected by use of a mobile phones"" does not necessarily follow from the premise ""Startling new research claims that mobile phones may reduce a man's sperm count by up to 30%.""  To evaluate this, let's analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis:  1. The premise states that there is a new research finding about mobile phones affecting sperm count. 2. The hypothesis suggests that this research finding may be related to male fertility. 3. However, the premise does not provide any information about the direction or nature of the relationship between the research finding and male fertility.  The premise is saying that a new research finding has been discovered, but it does not specify whether the research finding is positive (suggesting a negative effect) or negative (suggesting no effect). There is no information about whether the research finding indicates that using mobile phones leads to a reduction in sperm count, an increase in sperm count, or some other effect on male fertility.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise, as it is unclear what the research finding would be."	229
1760484628	1760484628	Premise: Workers at the Lufthansa Technik Automotive plant in Co Dublin are due to vote today on changes to work practices being sought by the company's management. The aircraft engine maintenace firm has warned that rejection of the proposals would threaten a planned €17230m investment in the Rathcoole plant and put jobs at risk. LTA says it is not seeking any lay-offs or pay cuts and the planned investment would guarantee the future of the plant for the next 15 years. The work-practice changes are being sought following the collapse of Labour Relations Commission talks on the matter.  Hypothesis: Lufthansa Technik Automotive fires 30 workers.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise states that workers at the Lufthansa Technik Automotive plant in Co Dublin are due to vote on changes to work practices being sought by the company's management. The premise implies that the vote is likely to result in a rejection of the proposals, which would threaten the planned €17230m investment in the plant and put jobs at risk.  Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the workers would be fired as a result of the vote.	104
1760484628	1760484629	Premise: It rewrites the rules of global trade, established by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, in 1947, and modified in multiple rounds of negotiations since then.  Hypothesis: GATT was formed in 1947.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This statement does not follow from the premise. The premise states that GATT was formed in 1947, but it does not specify the hypothesis that GATT established the rules of global trade.  To establish the rules of global trade, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was established in 1947, as part of the post-WWII international economic order. However, the premise only specifies that GATT was formed, but not what its rules are.	99
1760484629	1760484629	Premise: Vice President Dick Cheney on Tuesday hurled an obscenity on the Senate floor to punctuate an angry exchange with Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy as all senators gathered for their annual photo.  Hypothesis: Cheney cursed at Sen. Patrick Leahy.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:  1. The premise states that Vice President Dick Cheney hurled an obscenity on the Senate floor. 2. The premise specifies that Cheney hurled the obscenity during an angry exchange with Sen. Patrick Leahy. 3. An obscenity is a word or phrase that is considered to be obscene, and is often considered to be profane or indecent. 4. An angry exchange implies that the context is tense and confrontational, suggesting that the words used are likely to be strong or abusive. 5. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the word Cheney hurled was likely an obscenity.  The hypothesis is supported by the premise and the context, making it a logical and plausible conclusion.	165
1760484629	1760484630	Premise: In the May 2005 general election Michael Howard failed to unseat the Labour Government, although the Conservatives did gain 33 seats, playing the most significant role in reducing Labour's majority from 167 to 66.  Hypothesis: In the May 2005 general election Conservatives got 33 seats.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis states that in the May 2005 general election, the Conservatives got 33 seats.   The premise states that in the May 2005 general election Michael Howard failed to unseat the Labour Government, which means that Labour remained in power.  However, it does not state that the number of seats won by the Conservatives in the election was 33. The premise only states that the Conservative party gained 33 seats, but does not provide information about the number of seats they won.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the premise.	114
1760484630	1760484630	Premise: The Norwegian Newspaper Corpus is a large and self-expanding corpus of Norwegian newspaper texts. The collection of this dynamic and continually growing corpus began in 1998.  Hypothesis: Dagbladet is a Norwegian newspaper.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Norwegian Newspaper Corpus is a large and self-expanding corpus of Norwegian newspaper texts, but it does not provide any information that specifically identifies the newspaper ""Dagbladet"". The other newspapers mentioned in the premise are likely to be ""Dagbladet"", ""Aftenposten"", ""Akvært"", "" VG"", and ""Verdens Gang"".  To establish the hypothesis that ""Dagbladet"" is a Norwegian newspaper, we would need additional information that links the corpus to ""Dagbladet"". For example, we might need to know that ""Dagbladet"" is a well-known Norwegian newspaper that has a significant presence in the corpus. Without this additional information, it is not possible to conclude that ""Dagbladet"" is a Norwegian newspaper based solely on the premise."	185
1760484630	1760484631	Premise: The Dutch, who ruled Indonesia until 1949, called the city of Jakarta Batavia.  Hypothesis: Formerly ( until 1949 ) Batavia, Jakarta is largest city and capital of Indonesia.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Dutch ruled Indonesia until 1949, and the hypothesis states that Batavia is the largest city and capital of Indonesia.  Although Batavia was indeed the capital of the Dutch East Indies (also known as Dutch East Indies) from 1818 to 1942, when the Dutch surrendered to the Allies, and from 1949 to the present day, Indonesia declared its independence, the Dutch East Indies had been under Dutch rule for more than 250 years prior to 1949. Therefore, the premise does not accurately reflect the historical context of the Dutch rule of Indonesia.  The hypothesis is also incorrect because the Dutch East Indies were not the largest city in Indonesia. The largest city in Indonesia is Jakarta, which was founded by the Dutch in 1808 and was renamed Jakarta in 1945 after Indonesia gained independence.	184
1760484631	1760484631	"Premise: The name for the newest James Bond film has been announced today. The 22nd film, previously known only as ""Bond 22"", will be called ""Quantum of Solace"". EON Productions who are producing the film made the announcement today at Pinewood Studios, where production for the film has been under way since last year. The name of the film was inspired by a short story (of the same name) from For Your Eyes Only by Bond creator, Ian Fleming.  Hypothesis: James Bond was created by Ian Fleming.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the 22nd James Bond film is called ""Quantum of Solace"", but it does not provide any information about the creation of the character or the source of the story that inspired the title.   In fact, the premise only mentions Ian Fleming as the creator of James Bond and that the film is based on a short story called ""For Your Eyes Only"". Therefore, the hypothesis that James Bond was created by Ian Fleming cannot be supported by the premise."	107
1760484631	1760484632	Premise: The gastric bypass operation, also known as stomach stapling, has become the most common surgical procedure for treating obesity.  Hypothesis: Obesity is medically treated.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"The hypothesis ""Obesity is medically treated"" does not necessarily follow from the premise ""The gastric bypass operation is the most common surgical procedure for treating obesity.""  This is because the premise is stating that the gastric bypass operation is a common treatment for obesity, but it is not stating that obesity is a medical condition that can be treated with this procedure. In other words, obesity is a condition that is being treated, not the condition being treated.  A more accurate hypothesis would be: ""Obesity is a condition that can be treated with gastric bypass surgery."" This statement follows logically from the premise, as the premise states that gastric bypass surgery is a treatment for obesity."	135
1760484632	1760484633	Premise: The cost of the consumer of the United States fell in June.  Hypothesis: U.S. consumer spending dived in June.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"To analyze whether the hypothesis follows from the premise, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.  The premise states: ""The cost of the consumer of the United States fell in June.""  The hypothesis is: ""U.S. consumer spending dived in June.""  The premise provides a specific event (the cost of consumers fell) and a general statement (the cost of consumers) about the United States. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a general statement about consumer spending (diverged).  From a logical perspective, a premise should provide specific information that directly relates to the hypothesis. In this case, the premise mentions a specific event (cost fell) but does not provide any information about the direction or magnitude of the event. It only mentions that the cost of consumers fell, but does not specify whether it was an increase, decrease, or no change.  The hypothesis, however, does not provide any specific information about the direction or magnitude of the event. It simply states that ""diverged,"" which is a vague term that does not necessarily imply a specific direction.  Therefore, I would argue that the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise provides specific information about the cost of consumers, but the hypothesis does not provide any logical connection to the premise."	264
1760484633	1760484633	"Premise: The former leader of Iraq was rushed to hospital last Sunday after refusing to eat for sixteen days. But according to news agencies, he has ended the hunger strike by eating lunch at the court in Baghdad. ""Saddam ate beef and rice and cola with bread which he brought from hospital,"" one source told Reuters news agency. He was fasting with three co-defendants, and they were demanding more security for their defence lawyers, three of whom have been murdered.  Hypothesis: Some Australians have fasted to protest.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"The hypothesis ""Some Australians have fasted to protest"" does not follow from the premise ""The former leader of Iraq was rushed to hospital after refusing to eat for sixteen days.""   The premise states that Saddam was rushed to the hospital after fasting for 16 days, but it does not mention anything about Australians fasting. The premise does not provide any information about Australia or Australians, and it is not clear what they might be protesting about. Therefore, it is not reasonable to infer that the hypothesis is true based on the premise."	106
1760484633	1760484634	Premise: Sonia Gandhi can be defeated in the next elections in India by BJP.  Hypothesis: Sonia Gandhi is defeated by BJP.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"The hypothesis ""Sonia Gandhi can be defeated in the next elections in India by BJP"" follows from the premise ""Sonia Gandhi is defeated in the next elections in India by BJP.""   This is a classic example of a syllogism, a type of deductive reasoning that involves two premises and a conclusion. The structure is:  1. Premise (P): Sonia Gandhi can be defeated in the next elections in India by BJP. 2. Premise (P1): Sonia Gandhi is defeated in the next elections in India by BJP. 3. Conclusion (C): Therefore, Sonia Gandhi can be defeated in the next elections in India by BJP.  In this case, the conclusion logically follows from the premises because if Sonia Gandhi is defeated in the next elections by BJP, then it is a logical consequence of the premise. This is an example of a deductive argument, which is a type of argument that uses logic and reason to arrive at a certain conclusion based on given premises.  In other words, the hypothesis is a direct result of the premise, which makes it a valid argument."	226
1760484634	1760484634	Premise: Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has said that Mahmoud Abbas is a man that Israel can do business with.  Hypothesis: Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, may be someone Israel can talk with.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Ariel Sharon, the then-Prime Minister of Israel, said that Mahmoud Abbas is a man that Israel can do business with. This implies that there is a connection between the two individuals, specifically a business relationship.  The hypothesis states that Mahmoud Abbas may be someone Israel can talk with. This is a reasonable inference from the premise, as the premise establishes a connection between Sharon and Abbas. If Sharon said that Abbas is someone Israel can do business with, then it is likely that Abbas is someone that Israel can talk to.  In other words, the premise provides a basis for the hypothesis that Abbas is someone that Israel can talk to, given the context of Sharon's statement.	148
1760484634	1760484634	Premise: The Tempe Hometown Premiere will have all the trappings of a mega-Hollywood  event including red carpet arrivals, klieg lights, screaming fans, paparazzi and  media coverage of the film`s stars headed by Wolverine himself, Hugh Jackman and  including Liev Schreiber, Ryan Reynolds, Taylor Kitsch, Lynn Collins, will.i.am  and director Gavin Hood.  Following a hard-fought contest stretching over thousands of cities and towns  across the United States, Tempe emerged triumphant in a far-reaching, citywide  bid to nab the gala event. Mayor Hugh Hallman himself rallied the community,  which stepped up with dozens of videos that were posted on YouTube.  Hypothesis: Hugh Jackman plays the role of Wolverine in the movie.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise mentions Wolverine being the star of the movie, but it does not explicitly state that Wolverine is the star of the movie. The premise only mentions Hugh Jackman as one of the stars of the movie, but it does not confirm that he plays the role of Wolverine.	68
1760484634	1760484635	Premise: In October, however, amid rising tensions between the government and opposition groups, a car bomb seriously injured an opposition politician and killed his driver, in Beirut.  Hypothesis: A member of the opposition was injured in a car bomb attack in Beirut.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that ""Premise: In October, however, amid rising tensions between the government and opposition groups, a car bomb seriously injured an opposition politician and killed his driver, in Beirut."" The key phrase here is ""In Beirut."" This phrase indicates that the incident occurred in Beirut, which is a specific location, but it does not necessarily imply that the attack was carried out by opposition groups. There could have been any number of perpetrators.  The premise does not provide any information about the identity of the perpetrator, the motive for the attack, or any other relevant details that would allow us to infer that the attack was carried out by opposition groups. Therefore, we cannot infer that the hypothesis is true based solely on the premise."	160
1760484635	1760484637	Premise: Weinstock painstakingly reviewed dozens of studies for evidence of any link between sunscreen use and either an increase or decrease in melanoma.  Hypothesis: skin cancer numbers increase.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"The hypothesis that ""skin cancer numbers increase"" follows from the premise ""Weinstock painstakingly reviewed dozens of studies for evidence of any link between sunscreen use and either an increase or decrease in melanoma"" can be argued as follows:  1. **Correlation does not imply causation**: Just because we found a correlation between sunscreen use and melanoma rates in some studies, it doesn't mean that sunscreen causes melanoma. This is known as the ""correlation-disease"" or ""correlation-study"" problem. Many factors can influence the relationship between sunscreen use and melanoma, such as lifestyle, genetics, and access to sunlight.  2. **Selection bias and confounding variables**: Some studies may have been biased towards those who are more likely to use sunscreen, while others may not. For example, people who use sunscreen are more likely to be sun-avoidant, healthy individuals, while those who don't use sunscreen may be more likely to be sun-exposed. These biases can lead to an overestimation of the effect of sunscreen use on melanoma rates.  3. **Dose-response relationship is not well established**: While some studies suggest that sunscreen use may reduce melanoma risk, the evidence is not strong enough to establish a clear dose-response relationship. The risk of melanoma may be influenced by various factors, such as the type of sunscreen, duration of use, and individual susceptibility.  4. **Variability in study populations and outcomes**: Different studies may have different populations, sample sizes, and study designs, which can lead to variability in results. These differences can make it challenging to draw conclusions across studies.  5. **Other factors could be driving the observed association**: Other factors, such as changes in sun protection measures or changes in population demographics, could be contributing to the observed increase in melanoma rates. For example, increased use of sunscreen may be associated with increased rates of other skin cancers, such as basal cell carcinoma, or changes in sun protection measures may be contributing to an increase in melanoma rates.  In conclusion, while weinstock's review of studies may have identified some associations, it is essential to carefully consider the limitations and potential biases in the studies to draw meaningful conclusions about the relationship between sunscreen use and melanoma rates."	467
1760484637	1760484637	Premise: Most people are familiar with the idea of St. Bernards or other dogs taking part in rescue and recovery efforts. Robots might also take part in search and rescue missions.  Hypothesis: Robots are used to find missing victims.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"This hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the premise. The premise only mentions dogs, not robots. It does not provide any information about the types of robots that might be used in rescue and recovery efforts. Therefore, it is not clear what kind of robots might be involved in these efforts.  A more accurate hypothesis might be:  ""Robots are likely to be used in search and rescue efforts.""  This hypothesis is based on the premise, but it is more specific and does not assume that the premise only refers to dogs."	107
1760484637	1760484637	Premise: Illinois born Charlton Heston was a 27-year-old actor from Broadway and television when he arrived in Hollywood for a five-picture contract with Hal Wallis.  Hypothesis: Charlton Heston was born in Illinois.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Charlton Heston was born in Illinois and that he arrived in Hollywood for a five-picture contract with Hal Wallis. This implies that Heston was present in Illinois at the time of his arrival in Hollywood.  Since Heston was born in Illinois, it is a logical conclusion that he was present in Illinois at the time of his arrival in Hollywood. The premise establishes the connection between Heston's birthplace and his arrival in Hollywood, making it a valid hypothesis.	111
1760484637	1760484638	Premise: Ruth's 1927 single season record of 60 home runs stood unsurpassed until Roger Maris hit 61 in 1961.  Hypothesis: Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs in his lifetime.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	To determine if the hypothesis follows from the premise, we need to evaluate the relationship between the two statements.  Premise: Ruth's 1927 single-season record of 60 home runs stood unsurpassed until Roger Maris hit 61 in 1961.  The premise implies that Ruth's 1927 season record was the highest single-season home run record until Maris's record in 1961. This suggests that Ruth's 1927 season record was a record, and that he was the best single-season home run hitter in the history of baseball.  Hypothesis: Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs in his lifetime.  This hypothesis claims that Ruth hit 60 home runs in his lifetime. If the premise is true, then the hypothesis is true.  The issue is that the premise does not necessarily imply that Ruth hit 60 home runs in his lifetime. The premise only states that his 1927 season record was the highest single-season home run record, which does not provide any information about the overall number of home runs Ruth hit in his lifetime. In fact, it's possible that Ruth hit fewer home runs than 60 in his lifetime.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.	250
1760484638	1760484639	Premise: The German technology was employed to build Shanghai's existing maglev line, the first in the world to be used commercially.  Hypothesis: Maglev is commercially used.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the German technology was employed to build Shanghai's existing maglev line, the first in the world to be used commercially. However, this premise is incorrect. The Maglev technology is actually a Japanese invention, developed by Hitachi in the 1960s, and it was first used in the 1976 Shanghai Maglev train, which is the world's first commercial maglev line. Therefore, the premise is incorrect.  The hypothesis that maglev is commercially used is not supported by the premise, as the premise only mentions that the technology was employed to build the Shanghai line, not that it was used commercially.	139
1760484639	1760484639	"Premise: SEATTLE — United Nations gang leader Clay Roueche should spend at least 30 years behind bars after his surprise guilty plea here Tuesday for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine, marijuana and illicit drug profits, U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Sullivan said. Sullivan said outside court that Roueche's leadership of the violent UN gang and the sophistication of the international drug conspiracy will all be factors used to argue for a longer sentence — up to life — for the 33-year-old Canadian. And he stressed that the plea agreement reached with Roueche did not include ""any kind of break with respect to sentencing."".  Hypothesis: Clay Roueche is 33 years old.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise only states that Clay Roueche is 33 years old and that a plea agreement was reached. It does not provide any information about his age.	44
1760484639	1760484639	"Premise: Baker's voice will replace the earlier computer-synthesized voice that was previously used. BT said that his voice was chosen as it was instantly recognisable. It took him 11 days to record 11,593 phrases and sounds which could then be broken down and reassembled by a computer to make new words. It then took five months to process these recordings to make a workable service. BT have said that there will be no barriers as to what Tom Baker's voice can 'say', including rude words. ""What appeals to me most is the thought that I will be bringing good news to people whether it is a cheeky message, a birthday greeting, or just a quick hello,"" said Baker.  Hypothesis: Tom Baker works for BT.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Baker's voice was chosen because it is instantly recognizable, but it does not imply that Baker works for BT. The phrase ""Baker's voice"" is a common way to refer to Tom Baker, the actor who played the Doctor in Doctor Who, but it does not necessarily mean that Baker is associated with BT."	80
1760484639	1760484640	Premise: The Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for the selection of the candidates and the choice of Prize Winners for the Peace Prize. The Committee is composed of five members appointed by the Storting (Norwegian parliament). The Peace Prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway and not in Stockholm, Sweden like the other Nobel Prizes.  Hypothesis: Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for the selection of the candidates and the choice of Prize Winners for the Peace Prize. However, it does not specify that the Committee's choice is final and binding.  While it is possible that the Committee may choose the Peace Prize winner, it is not guaranteed that they will do so. The Committee's decisions are subject to review and appeal by the Norwegian parliament, the Storting, which can potentially block or modify the decision.  Therefore, the hypothesis ""Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen"" is not necessarily true, and the actual outcome may differ from the stated premise."	140
1760484640	1760484640	Premise: More than 150 dolphins, marine turtles and beaked whales have been washed up dead on beaches in Africa.  Hypothesis: Dead dolphins, turtles and whales have been found on African beaches.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise is stating that more than 150 dolphins, marine turtles, and beaked whales have been washed up dead on beaches in Africa, but it does not specify the number of each species.   To establish a hypothesis, we need to infer the number of each species based on the premise. If the premise is correct, then it should be possible to determine the number of each species. However, without more specific information about the number of dolphins, turtles, and whales, we cannot make this inference.	111
