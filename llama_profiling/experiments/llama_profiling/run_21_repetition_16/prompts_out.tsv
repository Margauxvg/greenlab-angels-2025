1760545608	1760545609	Premise: No Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq Yet.  Hypothesis: Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This is a classic example of a syllogism with a fallacy.  The premise states that "No Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq Yet." This is a statement that is likely true, as the premise is based on publicly available information.  The hypothesis, "Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq," is not necessarily true. There is no conclusive evidence to support this claim, and it is possible that no weapons of mass destruction have been found in Iraq.  The flaw in the syllogism is that it assumes that the premise is true, and then applies that truth to arrive at a false conclusion. This is an example of a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent.  To disprove the hypothesis, we would need to find evidence that contradicts the premise, or provide a new premise that supports the hypothesis. However, since there is no evidence to support the hypothesis, we cannot disprove it based on the premise.
1760545609	1760545609	Premise: A place of sorrow, after Pope John Paul II died, became a place of celebration, as Roman Catholic faithful gathered in downtown Chicago to mark the installation of new Pope Benedict XVI.  Hypothesis: Pope Benedict XVI is the new leader of the Roman Catholic Church.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that a place of sorrow became a place of celebration after Pope John Paul II's death. However, the premise does not necessarily imply that the new Pope is John Paul II. It only mentions that the place became a place of celebration, without specifying who the new Pope is.  The new Pope's identity is not mentioned in the premise, so the hypothesis that the new Pope is John Paul II cannot be logically inferred from the premise. The premise only provides a temporal and geographical context (the place of sorrow becoming a place of celebration), without any information about the new Pope's identity.  Therefore, the hypothesis is unfounded and does not follow from the premise.
1760545609	1760545610	Premise: Herceptin was already approved to treat the sickest breast cancer patients, and the company said, Monday, it will discuss with federal regulators the possibility of prescribing the drug for more breast cancer patients.  Hypothesis: Herceptin can be used to treat breast cancer.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Herceptin was already approved for treating breast cancer patients. The word "already" indicates that Herceptin is not a new drug, but rather a product that has been approved for use. The hypothesis, however, claims that Herceptin can be used for treating breast cancer, which is not necessarily true.  The premise establishes that Herceptin is a product that has been approved for use, but it does not provide information about its mechanism of action or its potential effects on breast cancer. The hypothesis, therefore, is an unsubstantiated claim and is not supported by the premise.
1760545610	1760545610	Premise: Judie Vivian, chief executive at ProMedica, a medical service company that helps sustain the 2-year-old Vietnam Heart Institute in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), said that so far about 1,500 children have received treatment.  Hypothesis: The previous name of Ho Chi Minh City was Saigon.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that "so far about 1,500 children have received treatment", but it does not provide any information about the name of the city. The name "Saigon" was changed to "Ho Chi Minh City" after the fall of Saigon in 1975. Therefore, it is not clear how the number of children treated (1,500) relates to the name change.
1760545610	1760545610	Premise: A man is due in court later charged with the murder 26 years ago of a teenager whose case was the first to be featured on BBC One's Crimewatch. Colette Aram, 16, was walking to her boyfriend's house in Keyworth, Nottinghamshire, on 30 October 1983 when she disappeared. Her body was later found in a field close to her home. Paul Stewart Hutchinson, 50, has been charged with murder and is due before Nottingham magistrates later.  Hypothesis: Paul Stewart Hutchinson is accused of having stabbed a girl.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Colette Aram, a 16-year-old girl, was walking to her boyfriend's house in Keyworth, Nottinghamshire, on 30 October 1983 when she disappeared. The premise does not provide any information about a murder occurring on that day, and there is no mention of a murder charge being made against anyone. In fact, the premise explicitly states that Paul Stewart Hutchinson was charged with murder, which suggests that the premise is actually about a different case.  Therefore, the premise does not logically lead to the hypothesis that Paul Stewart Hutchinson is accused of having stabbed a girl.
1760545610	1760545611	Premise: Britain said, Friday, that it has barred cleric, Omar Bakri, from returning to the country from Lebanon, where he was released by police after being detained for 24 hours.  Hypothesis: Bakri was briefly detained, but was released.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Britain has barred Omar Bakri from returning to the country, but it does not state that Bakri was detained by Britain. The premise only mentions that Bakri was released by the police in Lebanon. Therefore, the hypothesis that Bakri was briefly detained is not supported by the premise.
1760545611	1760545611	Premise: Nearly 4 million children who have at least one parent who entered the U.S. illegally were born in the United States and are U.S. citizens as a result, according to the study conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center. That's about three quarters of the estimated 5.5 million children of illegal immigrants inside the United States, according to the study. About 1.8 million children of undocumented immigrants live in poverty, the study found.  Hypothesis: Three quarters of U.S. illegal immigrants have children.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that nearly 4 million children who have at least one parent who entered the U.S. illegally are U.S. citizens, and that this is approximately three quarters of the estimated 5.5 million children of illegal immigrants. However, the premise does not provide information about the proportion of children of undocumented immigrants who are U.S. citizens. The premise does not establish a direct link between the percentage of U.S. citizens among children of illegal immigrants and the proportion of children of undocumented immigrants who are U.S. citizens.  To establish the hypothesis, you would need additional information about the proportion of U.S. citizens among children of undocumented immigrants.
1760545611	1760545612	Premise: Like the United States, U.N. officials are also dismayed that Aristide killed a conference called by Prime Minister Robert Malval in Port-au-Prince in hopes of bringing all the feuding parties together.  Hypothesis: Aristide had Prime Minister Robert Malval  murdered in Port-au-Prince.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the premise. Here's why:  The premise states that Aristide killed a conference called by Prime Minister Robert Malval in Port-au-Prince, but it does not explicitly state that the conference was a meeting of feuding parties. It only mentions that Aristide wanted to bring them together.   If the conference was just a meeting between Aristide and some other individuals, the hypothesis that Aristide killed the conference is still not necessarily true. There could have been other reasons for the conference, such as Aristide's personal interests, his desire to gain power, or other external factors.  For example, it could have been a private meeting between Aristide and a small group of loyal supporters, and not a public conference with representatives from the feuding parties. In this case, the hypothesis that Aristide killed the conference is still not supported by the premise.
1760545612	1760545612	Premise: WASHINGTON --  A newly declassified narrative of the Bush administration's advice to the CIA on harsh interrogations shows that the small group of Justice Department lawyers who wrote memos authorizing controversial interrogation techniques were operating not on their own but with direction from top administration officials, including then-Vice President Dick Cheney and national security adviser Condoleezza Rice. At the same time, the narrative suggests that then-Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and then-Secretary of State Colin Powell were largely left out of the decision-making process.  Hypothesis: Dick Cheney was the Vice President of Bush.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Bush administration's advice to the CIA on harsh interrogation techniques was given by a small group of Justice Department lawyers, with direction from top administration officials. However, the premise does not provide any information about Dick Cheney's role in the administration.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Dick Cheney was the Vice President of Bush. This information is not mentioned in the premise, and it would be necessary to add a new premise to establish a connection between the two statements.  Additionally, the premise does not provide any information about the nature of the decision-making process or the specific individuals involved in the decision-making process. Therefore, it is not possible to infer the hypothesis from the premise.
1760545612	1760545613	Premise: Only a week after it had no comment on upping the storage capacity of its Hotmail e-mail service, Microsoft early Thursday announced it was boosting the allowance to 250MB to follow similar moves by rivals such as Google, Yahoo, and Lycos.  Hypothesis: Microsoft's Hotmail has raised its storage capacity to 250MB.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Microsoft announced a 250MB increase in Hotmail's storage capacity, but it does not directly state that this was a response to the premise. In other words, the premise is a statement about an action (Microsoft increasing storage capacity) and its impact (raising the storage capacity to 250MB), but it does not imply that the premise was the reason for this action.  To make the hypothesis follow from the premise, we would need to add a statement that connects the premise to the action, such as "As a direct result of the announcement, Microsoft raised its storage capacity to 250MB."
1760545613	1760545613	Premise: Lina Joy, 42, was born Azlina Jailani to Malay parents, and was raised as a Muslim. Malaysia's constitution guarantees freedom of religion, but by law, all ethnic Malays are Muslim. Joy converted to Christianity at age 26, and after some bureaucratic difficulties had her named legally changed in 1999. However, on her MyKad national ID, the National Registration Department retained her stated religion as Islam. In order to have her religion changed, the National Registration Department said Joy would have to obtain a certificate of apostasy from the Muslim Sharia Court.  Hypothesis: Lina Joy's parents are from Malaysia.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise states that Lina Joy was born to Malay parents and was raised as a Muslim, and that Malaysia's constitution guarantees freedom of religion. This implies that Malaysia is a multicultural society with a diverse population, where different ethnic groups, including the Malay ethnic group, have the right to practice their own religion.  The premise also states that Joy converted to Christianity, which is a religion practiced by the Malay ethnic group in Malaysia. The fact that Joy's parents are Malay and that she was raised as a Muslim, combined with her conversion to Christianity, suggests that there is a connection between the Malay ethnic group and the Christian religion.  Therefore, the hypothesis that Lina Joy's parents are from Malaysia can be logically inferred from the premise.
1760545613	1760545614	Premise: November 9, 1989 , the day the Berlin Wall fell and the world changed forever . Not even the most astute saw it coming . As Hungary's foreign minister in the late summer of 1989 , Gyula Horn gave the order to let visiting East Germans use his country to do a 400-mile end run around the Berlin Wall , a move now seen as the beginning of the end for hard-line communism in Europe .  Hypothesis: The Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "The Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989" does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that November 9, 1989, is the day the Berlin Wall fell, but it does not directly state that the wall was torn down. The wall was indeed torn down in 1989, but the premise is about the event that led to its fall, not the event itself.   The correct hypothesis should be "The Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989."
1760545614	1760545614	Premise: Valero Energy Corp., on Monday, said it found "extensive" additional damage at its 250,000-barrel-per-day Port Arthur refinery.  Hypothesis: Valero Energy Corp. produces 250,000 barrels per day.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Valero Energy Corp. produces 250,000 barrels per day. The hypothesis states that Valero Energy Corp. found "extensive" damage at its 250,000-barrel-per-day refinery. "Extensive" implies that the damage is significant, but it does not necessarily mean that the damage is more than 250,000 barrels per day.   For example, the premise could be true even if the refinery is still producing 250,000 barrels per day, but the damage is extensive.
1760545614	1760545615	Premise: Oil prices fall back as Yukos oil threat lifted  Hypothesis: Oil prices rise.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This is a classic example of a self-referential fallacy.  The premise is "Oil prices fall back as Yukos oil threat lifted", but the hypothesis is "Oil prices rise". The two statements are not logically connected, as the premise is describing a specific event (Yukos oil threat being lifted) that is not directly related to the hypothesis.  In other words, the premise is describing an external event that is causing a specific change in oil prices, but the hypothesis is making a prediction about the future direction of oil prices, which is not supported by the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis is not logically supported by the premise.  A more accurate statement would be "Oil prices remain stable" or "Oil prices remain low", as the premise does not provide any information about future changes in oil prices.
1760545615	1760545616	Premise: Brian Brohm, the Louisville quarterback, threw for 368 yards and five touchdowns as the Cardinals beat visiting Oregon State 63-27.  Hypothesis: The quarterback threw for 413 yards and three touchdowns, and then ran to the end zone two more times.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	To evaluate this hypothesis, let's analyze the given premise and the information provided.  The premise states that Brian Brohm threw for 368 yards and five touchdowns as the Cardinals beat visiting Oregon State 63-27.   Breaking down the premise:  - The number 368 is indeed the total yards Brian Brohm threw. - The number 5 is the number of touchdowns Brian Brohm threw. - The number 27 is the total score of the game.  The hypothesis states that Brian Brohm threw for 413 yards and ran to the end zone two more times. Let's analyze the possible scenarios that could lead to this outcome.  Scenario 1: Brian Brohm threw 413 yards, which is more than the 368 yards mentioned in the premise. Scenario 2: Brian Brohm ran for 413 yards, which is more than the 368 yards mentioned in the premise. Scenario 3: Brian Brohm ran for 413 yards and threw 5 touchdowns, which is not mentioned in the premise.  Since the premise only mentions Brian Brohm throwing for 368 yards and 5 touchdowns, and we know that he ran for 413 yards and threw 5 touchdowns, the hypothesis cannot be true.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.
1760545616	1760545616	Premise: Greg Page, a former heavyweight boxing champion who suffered a severe brain injury in a 2001 fight, has died at 50. His wife Patricia said the one-time WBA champion had died at his home in Kentucky, USA, of complications related to injuries he suffered in the fight. Page was in a coma for a week after the 9 March 2001 fight against Dale Crowe which was stopped in the 10th round. Patricia Page said he was "in a better place now" after announcing on Monday he had died overnight in his sleep.  Hypothesis: Greg Page was a WBA champion.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Greg Page was a former heavyweight boxing champion, but it does not provide any information about his current status. It does not mention anything about his current health or whether he is alive or dead. The premise only mentions that he suffered a severe brain injury, but it does not imply that he has died.   Therefore, the hypothesis that Greg Page was a WBA champion does not follow from the premise.
1760545616	1760545616	Premise: Sierra is likely to remain in jail at the Hillsborough County jail in her native Tampa until her next hearing on December 20, where she is being held without bail, which would prevent her attending the Washington event on Friday even if she still had permission to perform. Sierra has been in jail since the start of the month after an altercation with police officers outside a Tampa nightclub, which she had been ejected from. She is charged with disorderly intoxication and resisting arrest.  Hypothesis: Sierra once reached the finals of "American Idol".  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that Sierra is being held in jail at the Hillsborough County jail, which implies that she is likely to be released by the time of the Washington event, and therefore could attend the event. However, the premise does not mention anything about Sierra's plans to attend the event or her connection to the event.  The correct hypothesis should be something like "Sierra was in jail for the night of the Washington event, and is likely to be released by the time of the event."
1760545616	1760545617	Premise: Since 1987, however, Brazil has taken steps to dramatically reduce the destruction, including stepped-up enforcement and the elimination of tax incentives that led to large-scale land clearing.  Hypothesis: In the early 1990s Brazil began to take action to save the rainforest.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that since 1987, Brazil has taken steps to dramatically reduce the destruction of the rainforest, including stepped-up enforcement and the elimination of tax incentives that led to large-scale land clearing. However, this does not imply that the premise is true.  To follow the hypothesis, the premise would need to be modified to say that the actions taken by Brazil in the early 1990s did indeed lead to a significant reduction in rainforest destruction. In other words, the premise should be stated as: "Since 1987, Brazil has taken steps to dramatically reduce the destruction of the rainforest, including stepped-up enforcement and the elimination of tax incentives that led to large-scale land clearing."
1760545617	1760545617	Premise: FIFA has received 11 bids to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments, an international football competition contested by the men's national teams. The countries vying to host the tournament are Australia, England, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Qatar, Russia, South Korea and United States, who have individual bids and the joint bids are from Belgium-Netherlands and Spain-Portugal.  Select bids are for 2018 and 2022 tournaments and two bids are just for the 2022 tournament. Qatar and South Korea are vying just for the 2022 tournament. The two winning bids will be chosen on December 2010 by the 24-man executive committee of FIFA.  Said FIFA president Sepp Blatter: "We are very pleased about the fantastic level of interest in our flagship competition, with all initial bidders confirming their candidature."  Hypothesis: Sepp Blatter is the president of FIFA.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that FIFA has received bids for both the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments, but it does not explicitly state that the two winning bids are for the 2018 tournament.  The premise mentions that "two bids are just for the 2022 tournament" but does not provide any information about the bids for the 2018 tournament. Therefore, it is not possible to infer that the two winning bids for the 2022 tournament are for the 2018 tournament, and the hypothesis is not supported by the given premise.
1760545617	1760545618	Premise: U.S. crude settled $1.32 lower at $42.83 a barrel.  Hypothesis: Crude the light American lowered to the closing 1.32 dollars, to 42.83 dollars the barrel.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	To assess whether the hypothesis follows from the premise, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.  The premise states that U.S. crude settled $1.32 lower at $42.83 a barrel.   The hypothesis states that crude the light American lowered to the closing 1.32 dollars, to 42.83 dollars the barrel.  There is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise is stating a specific price change (1.32 dollars) at a specific date (closing price), while the hypothesis is stating a different price (42.83 dollars) at a different date. There is no logical link between the two statements.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.
1760545618	1760545618	Premise: WINNENDEN, Germany ―A teenage gunman killed 15 people, most of them female, on Wednesday in a rampage that began at a school near Stuttgart in southern Germany and ended in a nearby town, where he then killed himself after the police wounded him. The attack left Germany, which tightened tough gun controls after a similar attack at a school seven years ago, struggling to understand the carnage that had again befallen it, a country with relatively little violent crime. In 2002, a gunman killed 16 people before killing himself at a school in Erfurt, in eastern Germany.  Hypothesis: In 2002 near Stuttgart a boy shot 16 people.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise mentions a 15-year-old gunman who killed most of the victims, but it does not mention the fact that the victims were boys. The premise does not provide any information about the sex of the victims, only that most of them were female.  Therefore, the hypothesis that the 2002 attack was perpetrated by a 15-year-old boy does not follow from the premise.
1760545618	1760545619	Premise: Many hopes are riding on the sale of Talisman's holdings in Palm Beach and Hendry counties, which Vice President Al Gore announced with much fanfare last year at the 50th anniversary of Everglades National Park.  Hypothesis: Everglades National Park is located in Florida.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise mentions Vice President Al Gore's announcement at the 50th anniversary of Everglades National Park, but it does not imply that Vice President Gore is associated with the park or its holdings in Palm Beach and Hendry counties. The premise only states that Vice President Gore made an announcement, but does not provide any information about his connection to the park or its ownership.
1760545619	1760545619	Premise: Rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy and ultimately death. Early symptoms of rabies in humans are nonspecific, consisting of fever, headache, and general malaise.  Hypothesis: Rabies is fatal in humans.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy and ultimately death. However, it does not explicitly state that the virus causes death.  The premise only describes the effects of the virus on the central nervous system, but it does not imply that the virus is fatal in humans. In fact, the premise suggests that the virus is a cause of encephalopathy and death, but it does not provide any information about the virus's effect on human health.  Therefore, the hypothesis that Rabies is fatal in humans cannot be derived from the premise, as it is not explicitly stated that the virus is fatal.
1760545619	1760545620	Premise: American tobacco companies were showing a profit most quarters due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products sold including food.  Hypothesis: PM often entered markets with both cigarettes and food.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that American tobacco companies were showing a profit due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products including food. However, this implies that the tobacco industry's diversification into food products is the primary reason for their profitability, which is not necessarily true.  Tobacco companies have historically been successful in diversifying their product lines to reduce their dependence on cigarettes. This diversification can include non-tobacco products such as snack foods, beverages, and other consumer goods. By expanding their product offerings, tobacco companies can reduce their reliance on a single market (cigarettes) and increase their revenue streams.  In contrast, the premise does not provide any information about tobacco companies entering the food market for reasons other than diversification. The hypothesis assumes that the diversification into food is the primary reason for their profitability, which may not be the case.  A more accurate hypothesis would be that the tobacco companies' diversification into food products is an incidental benefit of their expansion into export markets, rather than the primary reason for their profitability.
1760545620	1760545620	Premise: The development of agriculture by early humans, roughly 10,000 years ago, was also harmful to many natural ecosystems as they were systematically destroyed and replaced with artificial versions.  Hypothesis: Humans existed 10,000 years ago.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis that humans existed 10,000 years ago does not follow from the premise. The premise suggests that humans existed 10,000 years ago, but it does not provide any information about the development of agriculture.  To follow from the premise, the hypothesis would need to be related to the premise in some way, such as:  * The premise implies that humans were present in some form before agriculture developed. * The premise provides some indication that humans existed 10,000 years ago.  As it stands, the premise simply states that humans existed 10,000 years ago, without any connection to the development of agriculture.
1760545620	1760545621	Premise: The two young leaders of the coup, Pibul Songgram and Pridi Phanomyang, both educated in Europe and influenced by Western ideas, came to dominate Thai politics in the ensuing years.  Hypothesis: Pibul was a young leader.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise establishes that Pibul Songgram and Pridi Phanomyang, the two young leaders of the coup, both came to dominate Thai politics in the ensuing years. This implies that their rise to power is directly linked to their educational background and exposure to Western ideas.   Given that they were educated in Europe, it's reasonable to infer that they were influenced by Western ideas, which likely shaped their views and informed their decision-making processes. This, in turn, contributed to their ability to lead and ultimately, dominate Thai politics.   Therefore, the hypothesis that Pibul was a young leader is indeed supported by the premise.
1760545621	1760545621	Premise: Lin Piao, after all, was the creator of Mao's "Little Red Book" of quotations.  Hypothesis: Lin Piao wrote the "Little Red Book".  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Lin Piao was the creator of Mao's "Little Red Book" of quotations, but it does not necessarily imply that Lin Piao wrote the book. Lin Piao was a high-ranking Communist Party official who was closely associated with Mao Zedong, and he played a significant role in editing the "Little Red Book", but he did not write it.
1760545621	1760545622	Premise: When patients interrupt a course of antibiotics, the surviving bacteria return with a vengeance, often having rapidly mutated to resist the therapy.  Hypothesis: Bacteria is winning the war against antibiotics.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Bacteria is winning the war against antibiotics" does not necessarily follow from the premise "Patients interrupt a course of antibiotics, the surviving bacteria return with a vengeance, often having rapidly mutated to resist the therapy."  The premise is more likely to suggest that antibiotics can help prevent bacterial infections and reduce the spread of bacteria, rather than that bacteria are inherently resistant to antibiotics.   The correct hypothesis should focus on the relationship between the premise and the potential outcome of not interrupting antibiotic therapy, rather than the premise itself.   A more plausible hypothesis might be: "When patients interrupt a course of antibiotics, the surviving bacteria can still be more resistant to therapy, even if the infection is treated."
1760545622	1760545622	Premise: Initially the Bundesbank opposed the introduction of the euro but was compelled to accept it in light of the political pressure of the capitalist politicians who supported its introduction.  Hypothesis: The introduction of the euro has been opposed.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis that the introduction of the euro was opposed by the Bundesbank is not necessarily true. The premise states that the Bundesbank opposed the introduction of the euro "initially." This means that the Bundesbank did not initially support the introduction of the euro.  The hypothesis should be "initially opposed," not "initially opposed."
1760545622	1760545622	Premise: The Armed Forces Press Committee (COPREFA) admitted that the government troops sustained 11 casualties in these clashes, adding that they inflicted three casualties on the rebels.  Hypothesis: Three rebels were killed by government troops.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the premise. The premise mentions the number of casualties sustained by government troops, but it does not provide any information about the number of casualties inflicted on the rebels. Therefore, the hypothesis is only related to the government's casualties, not the rebels' casualties.
1760545622	1760545623	Premise: One economic study will not be the basis of Canada's public policy decisions, but Easton's research does conclusively show that there are economic benefits in the legalization of marijuana.  Hypothesis: Drug legalization has benefits.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that "One economic study will not be the basis of Canada's public policy decisions," which implies that the study in question is likely a non-binding or non-binding recommendation study, or possibly an advisory study.   The hypothesis "Drug legalization has benefits" is a conclusion that is not supported by the premise. The premise does not provide any information about the study's methodology, findings, or conclusions, nor does it address the study's purpose or the potential benefits of legalization.   To follow from the premise, the hypothesis would require a different premise, such as "The study is a binding recommendation study that has led to a policy decision" or "The study has been cited as a basis for a policy recommendation by a government agency."
1760545623	1760545623	Premise: Archaeologists have found approximately 30 beautifully preserved mummies in a 4,000 year old Egyptian necropolis which held 53 tombs. Supervisor of Antiquities for Middle Egypt Dr. Abdel-Rahman El-Ayedi's team established his archaeological site in the Faiyum Oasis near the El-Lahun Egyptian pyramid which is just south of Cairo. Besides the mummies, the team found masks, amulets, clay pots and an offering table located in a funerary chapel. The chapel dates back to about 30 BC to 337 AD.  Hypothesis: 30 beautifully preserved mummies have been located in the south of Cairo.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "30 beautifully preserved mummies have been located in the south of Cairo" does not directly follow from the premise "Archaeologists have found approximately 30 beautifully preserved mummies in a 4,000 year old Egyptian necropolis which held 53 tombs."  The premise mentions that the 53 tombs held 30 mummies, but it does not imply that the 30 mummies were located in the south of Cairo. In fact, the 53 tombs were located in the necropolis, not the south of Cairo. Therefore, the hypothesis is not supported by the premise.  However, if we were to consider the premise as a starting point, we could infer that the 30 mummies are likely located in the south of Cairo, as the necropolis is located near the city of Cairo.
1760545623	1760545624	Premise: Gastrointestinal bleeding can happen as an adverse effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin or ibuprofen.  Hypothesis: Aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that gastrointestinal bleeding can happen as an adverse effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen. However, the hypothesis states that aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding, which is the opposite of what is known to be true.  NSAIDs, including aspirin, are known to cause gastrointestinal bleeding as a side effect. The premise only states that the bleeding can happen, but not that the NSAID causes it. Therefore, the hypothesis is incorrect and does not follow logically from the premise.
1760545624	1760545624	Premise: A former employee of the company, David Vance of South Portland, said Hooper spent a lot of time on the road, often meeting with customers between Portland and Kittery.  Hypothesis: Hooper is a citizen of Portland.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Hooper spent a lot of time on the road, often meeting with customers between Portland and Kittery. However, it does not provide any information about Hooper's place of residence. The premise only mentions that Hooper traveled to Kittery, but it does not specify that he lives there.  Therefore, the hypothesis that Hooper is a citizen of Portland cannot be logically deduced from the premise.
1760545624	1760545624	Premise: Cyprus, divided or not, joins the EU on the 1st of May.  Hypothesis: Cyprus was divided into two parts on May 1.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise states that Cyprus is divided, which implies that Cyprus is not a single, unified entity. This statement is true, as Cyprus is indeed divided into two separate parts: the Republic of Cyprus (Kypria) and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus), which is recognized by only a few countries.  The hypothesis states that Cyprus joined the EU on May 1, which implies that Cyprus has been integrated into the EU. Given that Cyprus is divided, it is reasonable to conclude that it has indeed joined the EU.  The conclusion follows logically from the premise, as the division of Cyprus into two separate entities would make it impossible for it to be a unified country, and therefore, it would be a prerequisite for it to join the EU.
1760545624	1760545625	Premise: World leaders expressed concern on Thursday that North Korea will quit six-party nuclear disarmament talks and will  bolster its nuclear weapons arsenal.  Hypothesis: North Korea says it has a stockpile of nuclear weapons and is building more.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that North Korea has expressed concern that the six-party talks will be disrupted and it will bolster its nuclear weapons arsenal. This implies that North Korea is unlikely to quit the talks, as it is attempting to improve its situation.   However, the premise does not necessarily suggest that North Korea will build more nuclear weapons. In fact, it is possible that North Korea is simply trying to pressure the other parties to agree to its demands, and is not necessarily building more nuclear weapons.
1760545625	1760545625	Premise: In addition to establishing the electoral commission, the laws also concern nationality, a contentious issue since citizenship laws were tightened to exclude one of Gbagbo's main competitors from the 2000 presidential race, former prime minister Alassane Ouattara.  Hypothesis: Gbagbo is a competitor of Ouattara.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the laws concern nationality, and it is not specified what type of nationality or who is excluded. This leaves room for various possibilities, such as the citizenship of Gbagbo, Ouattara, or both. Without additional context or information, it is impossible to conclude that Gbagbo is a competitor of Ouattara.
1760545625	1760545625	Premise: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace Prize, though he was nominated for it five times between 1937 and 1948.  Hypothesis: Mohandas received the Nobel Prize in 1989.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace Prize, but the hypothesis suggests that he received the Nobel Prize in 1989.   If Gandhi did receive the Nobel Peace Prize, it would be a direct contradiction to the premise, as it would mean that the premise is false.
1760545625	1760545626	Premise: The Christian Democrats (CDU) won 35.2% of the vote, or 225 seats, against 34.3% for Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats (SPD).  Hypothesis: It seems unlikely that there will be a coalition between Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats and Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Christian Democrats (CDU) won 35.2% of the vote, or 225 seats, while the Social Democrats (SPD) won 34.3% of the vote, or 225 seats. This implies that the CDU won a majority of the seats (225 - 225 = 0 seats).  However, the premise does not provide information about the number of seats won by the SPD or the total number of seats in the Bundestag.   The premise only provides information about the relative share of votes for the two parties, which is not sufficient to infer the outcome of any possible coalition between them. Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.
1760545626	1760545626	Premise: Edward VIII became King in January of 1936 and abdicated in December.  Hypothesis: King Edward VIII abdicated in December 1936.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Edward VIII became King in January 1936 and abdicated in December 1936. This means that the premise only provides information about the timing of Edward VIII's reign, but not the exact date of his abdication.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, assumes that the premise is true, which it is not. The premise only provides a specific date (January 1936) but does not guarantee that the abdication occurred on that date.  Therefore, the hypothesis is not supported by the premise, and it is not necessarily true.
1760545626	1760545627	Premise: Australian Guantanamo Bay detainee David Hicks has won British citizenship, opening the door for a possible bid to have him freed from the US detention facility in Cuba. Justice Lawrence Collins of the British High Court has overturned the British Government's refusal of citizenship to Hicks, whose mother was born in England. Justice Collins said the Government had "no power to withhold or deprive citizenship". Justice Collins said: "In my view it would be improper to fail to give assistance which otherwise would have been given, simply because the claimant was believed to be involved in terrorism and has not had any previous connection with this country." Hicks' lawyer, Stephen Grosz, said the decision was a breakthrough. He said there was now no reason why Hicks should not enjoy the same protection as the nine other British citizens released without charge from Guantanamo Bay on representations of the British Government.  Hypothesis: Stephen Grosz is the British lawyer of David Hicks.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, it does not follow from the premise.  The premise is that David Hicks has won British citizenship, which is a separate event from the premise that Stephen Grosz is his lawyer. The premise does not provide any information about Stephen Grosz or his role in the case, so it does not logically follow that he is David Hicks' lawyer.
1760545627	1760545627	Premise: Rockweed has been harvested commercially in Nova Scotia since the late 1950's and is currently the most important commercial seaweed in Atlantic Canada.  Hypothesis: Marine vegetation is  harvested.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that rockweed has been harvested commercially in Nova Scotia since the late 1950s, but it does not specify what rockweed is or why it is harvested. There is no indication in the premise that rockweed is a type of seaweed, nor does it provide any information about the purpose or reason for harvesting it.  The premise could be interpreted in two ways, but the hypothesis is not necessarily true. For example, rockweed might be a type of seaweed that is not harvested commercially, or it might be harvested for other reasons not mentioned in the premise.
1760545627	1760545628	Premise: Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has ordered security forces to take firm action against rioters following the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto. The violence has left at least 44 people dead and dozens injured. Mr. Musharraf insisted the measures were to protect people. VOA's Ayaz Gul reports from Islamabad that a bitter dispute has also erupted over how the 54-year-old politician died and who was behind her assassination.  Hypothesis: Musharraf has ordered rioters to take firm action against security forces.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that President Pervez Musharraf ordered security forces to take firm action against rioters following the assassination of Benazir Bhutto. The hypothesis suggests that the action taken by the security forces was in response to the assassination, which is not directly stated in the premise. The premise only mentions that Musharraf ordered security forces to take action, but does not mention the specific reason or context for the action.   The premise does not provide any information about the motivations behind Musharraf's decision, and the hypothesis does not make any explicit connection to the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.
1760545628	1760545628	Premise: A month after Gov. David A. Paterson dropped his proposal for a soda tax, New York City's health commissioner has written an article advocating "hefty" taxes on sodas and sports drinks containing sugar. Such a tax, the article said, could be the biggest boon to public health since tobacco taxes. The commissioner, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, and Kelly D. Brownell of Yale University, his co-author, argue in the New England Journal of Medicine that a tax of a penny per ounce could reduce consumption by more than 10 percent and raise $1.2 billion a year in New York State alone.  Hypothesis: Michael Bloomberg is the mayor of New York.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that a "hefty" tax on sodas and sports drinks containing sugar could be the biggest boon to public health since tobacco taxes, but it does not specify what the taxes would be or how they would be implemented. The premise only mentions that the tax is "hefty," implying that it would be a high tax, but it does not provide any information about the actual tax amount or the method of implementation.  In other words, the premise does not provide sufficient information to make a prediction about the hypothesis.
1760545628	1760545628	Premise: Officials said the Finnish suspect was among the dead but did not provide a motive for the attack.  Hypothesis: Officials said that the suspect, a Finnish citizen, was among the dead.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise simply states that the suspect is a Finnish citizen, but it does not provide any information about the suspect's involvement in the attack. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the suspect was among the dead, which is a separate and independent piece of information.  In other words, the premise does not imply that the suspect was the attacker, and the hypothesis is a separate conclusion that requires additional information to be supported.
1760545628	1760545629	Premise: Britain agreed to lift by March 31 a 150-mile military protection zone enforced around the islands since Argentina invaded them in 1982.  Hypothesis: The military protection zone around Falklands was lifted.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Britain agreed to lift the 150-mile military protection zone around the Falkland Islands by March 31, 1982. However, the Falklands War actually ended on June 14, 1982, with the withdrawal of British forces and the surrender of Argentine troops.   Therefore, the premise is incorrect, and the hypothesis cannot be logically derived from it.
1760545629	1760545629	Premise: The ferry owner PT Nur Budi's spokesman blamed Indonesian port authorities for the tragedy. "The passenger capacity of the ferry is 205 people but the port administrator accepted more passengers as they thought it was possible," he said. The National Meteorological and Geophysics Agency, however, had published and raised an alert signal about high waves on Friday. It specifically stated that "Saturday 10th and Sunday 11th, Indonesian waters would have witnessed storm force waves," but despite the dire warnings KM Teratai set for the seas.  Hypothesis: An Indonesian ferry with 300 passengers sank.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis follows from the premise. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:  1. The premise states that the ferry's passenger capacity is 205 people, but the port administrator accepted more passengers. 2. The National Meteorological and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) warned about storm force waves on Saturday and Sunday, which specifically mentioned the Indonesian waters. 3. The ferry, which has 300 passengers, exceeded the BMKG's warning by 95 passengers (300 - 205 = 95).  Therefore, the hypothesis that the ferry sank due to the storm force waves is supported by the premise that the ferry exceeded the capacity of the port.
1760545629	1760545630	Premise: Tension and battles between Greek police and anarchist demonstrators took place in the centre of Athens, Greece, during the anti-war demonstration of the 4th European Social Forum which is taking place in the Greek capital, from 4 to 7 of May 2006. The march of the approximately 1,000 anarchists ended with clashes between groups of anarchists and police. Riot police used tear gas, while a branch of a Greek bank, a fast-food store and around 50 shop windows in central Athens were damaged.  Hypothesis: The riots in Greece started on December 6.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise mentions "Tension and battles between Greek police and anarchist demonstrators took place in the centre of Athens, Greece, during the anti-war demonstration of the 4th European Social Forum", but it does not specify when these tensions started. The premise only mentions that the riots occurred in the 4th European Social Forum, which took place from 4 to 7 May 2006, but it does not state when the tensions escalated or started.  Therefore, the hypothesis that the riots started on December 6 cannot be logically derived from the premise.
1760545630	1760545630	Premise: Libya's case against Britain and the US concerns the dispute over their demand for extradition of Libyans charged with blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in 1988.  Hypothesis: One case involved the extradition of Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Libya is concerned about the demand for extradition of Libyans charged with blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in 1988. However, the hypothesis states that one case involved the extradition of Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing.   The premise focuses on the Libyan government's concern about extradition, while the hypothesis focuses on a specific case involving Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie bombing. These are two separate events, and the premise does not imply a direct connection between the two. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.
1760545630	1760545630	Premise: Argentina sought help from Britain on its privatization program and encouraged British investment.  Hypothesis: Argentina sought UK expertise on privatization and agriculture.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Argentina sought help from Britain on its privatization program and encouraged British investment. This implies that Argentina's privatization program was initiated or influenced by British expertise.  Given this premise, it is reasonable to assume that the hypothesis (Argentina sought UK expertise on privatization and agriculture) would logically follow.   The hypothesis essentially states that the method or approach used to privatize Argentina's economy (in this case, agriculture) was influenced by British expertise.
1760545630	1760545631	Premise: Instead of action on crime, we got the federal long gun registry, which became a bloated bureaucratic nightmare to responsible hunters, farmers and rural Canadians. It cost taxpayers some CA$2 billion and it hasn't done a thing to reduce gun crime. said Harper. The Conservatives have provided amnesty for unregistered gun owners. At this time there is no legislation set before the House of Commons. Conservative Garry Breitkreuz from Saskatchewan tabled the bill killing the long-gun registry.  Hypothesis: Garry Breitkreuz is a member of the Conservative Party.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that the long gun registry became a "bloat[ed] bureaucratic nightmare to responsible hunters, farmers, and rural Canadians", which suggests that the registry was intended to be a useful tool for regulating gun ownership. However, the hypothesis states that Garry Breitkreuz is a member of the Conservative Party, which implies that the registry is actually beneficial to them.  To follow the hypothesis from the premise, the hypothesis should be that Garry Breitkreuz is a member of the Conservative Party, which is not what the premise states. The premise simply mentions that Garry Breitkreuz tabled the bill to kill the long gun registry, without indicating that he is a member of the Conservative Party.
1760545631	1760545631	Premise: The researchers in the latest study fed one group of mice a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat. The diet started when the mice, all males, were 1 year old, which is middle-age in mouse longevity. As expected, the mice soon developed signs of impending diabetes, with grossly enlarged livers, and started to die much sooner than mice fed a standard diet.  Hypothesis: At the age of one year, male mice were fed with a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The premise is that the researchers fed one group of mice a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat.   The hypothesis states that the mice were fed with a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat.  The premise and the hypothesis are not identical, but the premise describes a specific outcome (60% of calories came from fat), while the hypothesis describes a specific condition (male mice).   However, if the premise describes the outcome, then the hypothesis must be true.   Therefore, the hypothesis follows from the premise.
1760545631	1760545632	Premise: The soldiers, who were said to have been wearing Arab headdress, were accused of firing at Iraqi police when stopped at a road block.  Hypothesis: The soldiers were driving a civilian car and were dressed in civilian clothes when a shooting took place between them and Iraqi patrols.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that the soldiers were wearing Arab headdresses and were accused of firing at Iraqi police. This implies that the soldiers were indeed in a military context, likely in a conflict zone, and were wearing a distinctive uniform that may have been perceived as threatening or intimidating by the Iraqi police.  Given this context, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the soldiers were driving a civilian car and were dressed in civilian clothes, as they were likely wearing the headdresses and uniforms as part of their military attire, which would be unusual in a civilian context.  The other possibility, that the soldiers were driving a civilian car and were not wearing Arab headdresses, is less plausible because it would contradict the premise, which states that the soldiers were wearing Arab headdresses.
1760545632	1760545633	Premise: The United States would like to see U.N. weapons inspectors return to Iraq providing the Iraqis take concrete, affirmative and demonstrable actions "to show full co-operation" Clinton said.  Hypothesis: U.N. weapons inspectors could stay in Iraq, Clinton said.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the United States wants the U.N. inspectors to "provide concrete, affirmative and demonstrable actions" from the Iraqis to show full cooperation. However, the premise does not specify what kind of actions these actions would be. It only mentions that they would be "affirmative" and "demonstrable", but does not provide any details on what those actions would entail.  To make a hypothesis that follows from the premise, the hypothesis would need to be more specific, such as:  "The United States would be satisfied if the Iraqis take concrete, affirmative and demonstrable actions to:  * Destroy all chemical and biological weapons * Severely restrict the production and stockpiling of chemical and biological agents * Provide a comprehensive and transparent system for the destruction of nuclear materials * Conduct regular, independent assessments of Iraq's compliance with these actions * Allow international monitors to conduct regular, unobstructed visits to Iraq to verify compliance * Provide Iraq with a clear plan for reducing its stockpile of chemical and biological agents * Cooperate fully with international efforts to prevent and respond to future threats to regional stability"  This revised hypothesis provides a more specific and concrete outline of what the Iraqis would need to do to demonstrate full cooperation, which is necessary for the United States to be satisfied.
1760545633	1760545633	Premise: On 12 August, the San Carlos Battalion came across mines placed in their path and one soldier was killed while two were seriously injured. Meanwhile on 10 August, urban commandos took a patrol car by surprise and dropped a grenade inside the car, injuring four and partially destroying the vehicle.  Hypothesis: A patrol car was attacked by the San Carlos Battalion.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise mentions the San Carlos Battalion and the urban commandos, but it does not mention the patrol car or any other vehicle. The premise only mentions the San Carlos Battalion and the urban commandos, which are different entities.
1760545633	1760545633	Premise: Bomb-sniffing dogs were brought to Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment.  Hypothesis: Bomb-sniffing dogs were estimated at Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that bomb-sniffing dogs were brought to Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment, but it does not provide any information about the quantity of the dogs. It only mentions that they were brought to the apartment. The premise does not specify how many dogs there were or what type of dogs were brought.  Therefore, the hypothesis (bomb-sniffing dogs at Rodriguez's Mulberry St.) cannot be logically deduced from the premise (bomb-sniffing dogs were brought to Rodriguez's Mulberry St.).
1760545633	1760545634	Premise: Startling new research into mobile phones claims they may reduce a man's sperm count by up to 30%.  Hypothesis: Male fertility may be affected by use of a mobile phones.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Male fertility may be affected by use of a mobile phone" does not follow from the premise "Startling new research into mobile phones claims they may reduce a man's sperm count by up to 30%."  The premise is a specific claim about a specific research finding (a claim about a specific percentage reduction in sperm count). The hypothesis is a generalization that applies to all mobile phones, which is not supported by the premise.   The premise is likely an observational study or a study that finds a correlation between mobile phone use and a decrease in sperm count, but it does not establish causation. It's possible that the researchers found a correlation, but it's not a direct causal link between mobile phone use and male fertility. Therefore, the hypothesis is not supported by the premise.
1760545634	1760545634	Premise: Workers at the Lufthansa Technik Automotive plant in Co Dublin are due to vote today on changes to work practices being sought by the company's management. The aircraft engine maintenace firm has warned that rejection of the proposals would threaten a planned €17230m investment in the Rathcoole plant and put jobs at risk. LTA says it is not seeking any lay-offs or pay cuts and the planned investment would guarantee the future of the plant for the next 15 years. The work-practice changes are being sought following the collapse of Labour Relations Commission talks on the matter.  Hypothesis: Lufthansa Technik Automotive fires 30 workers.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the workers at the Lufthansa Technik Automotive plant in Co Dublin are due to vote on changes to work practices, but it does not provide any information about the outcome of the vote. It only states that the company's management is seeking to implement these changes.  The premise does not provide any information about the outcome of the vote, including whether the workers will accept or reject the proposed changes. The only information provided is that the company is seeking to implement the changes, which is a separate issue from the outcome of the vote.
1760545634	1760545635	Premise: It rewrites the rules of global trade, established by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, in 1947, and modified in multiple rounds of negotiations since then.  Hypothesis: GATT was formed in 1947.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The premise states that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was established in 1947, and it modifies the rules of global trade.   The hypothesis states that GATT was formed in 1947.  The reason why this hypothesis follows from the premise is that the premise explicitly mentions "1947", which is the year when GATT was established. Therefore, if the premise states that GATT was established in 1947, then logically, the hypothesis must also be true.
1760545635	1760545635	Premise: Vice President Dick Cheney on Tuesday hurled an obscenity on the Senate floor to punctuate an angry exchange with Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy as all senators gathered for their annual photo.  Hypothesis: Cheney cursed at Sen. Patrick Leahy.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise is that Vice President Dick Cheney hurled an obscenity on the Senate floor, but the hypothesis is that Cheney cursed at Sen. Patrick Leahy. This is a specific instance of Cheney's behavior, but it does not necessarily imply that he hurled an obscenity in general. The premise is a singular event, while the hypothesis is a generalization about Cheney's behavior.
1760545635	1760545636	Premise: In the May 2005 general election Michael Howard failed to unseat the Labour Government, although the Conservatives did gain 33 seats, playing the most significant role in reducing Labour's majority from 167 to 66.  Hypothesis: In the May 2005 general election Conservatives got 33 seats.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis that the Conservatives gained 33 seats does not necessarily follow from the premise.  The premise states that Michael Howard failed to unseat the Labour Government in the May 2005 general election, and that the Conservatives gained 33 seats. However, it does not provide any information about the outcome of the election.   To gain 33 seats, the Conservatives would have needed to win a majority of the remaining seats in the House of Commons, which is not stated in the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.
1760545636	1760545636	Premise: The Norwegian Newspaper Corpus is a large and self-expanding corpus of Norwegian newspaper texts. The collection of this dynamic and continually growing corpus began in 1998.  Hypothesis: Dagbladet is a Norwegian newspaper.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that "The Norwegian Newspaper Corpus is a large and self-expanding corpus of Norwegian newspaper texts." However, the hypothesis states that "Dagbladet is a Norwegian newspaper."   While it's possible for a corpus to be self-expanding and growing, this does not necessarily imply that the corpus is a specific, well-known newspaper. Dagbladet is actually a daily newspaper in Norway, but the corpus could potentially include other newspapers, not just Dagbladet.   Therefore, the hypothesis is an example of a non sequitur, where the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.
1760545636	1760545637	Premise: The Dutch, who ruled Indonesia until 1949, called the city of Jakarta Batavia.  Hypothesis: Formerly ( until 1949 ) Batavia, Jakarta is largest city and capital of Indonesia.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Formerly (until 1949) Batavia, Jakarta is largest city and capital of Indonesia" does not necessarily follow from the premise "The Dutch, who ruled Indonesia until 1949, called the city of Jakarta Batavia."  The premise only specifies that the Dutch ruled Indonesia until 1949, but it does not establish a causal relationship between the Dutch rule and the fact that Jakarta is the largest city and capital of Indonesia. In fact, the Dutch rule ended in 1949, but the city of Jakarta was already the capital of Indonesia since the Dutch colonial period, which lasted until the mid-20th century.  Therefore, the hypothesis is not supported by the premise. The hypothesis would be more accurately stated as "Formerly, Jakarta was the capital of Indonesia", as the Dutch rule ended before Jakarta became the capital.
1760545637	1760545637	Premise: The name for the newest James Bond film has been announced today. The 22nd film, previously known only as "Bond 22", will be called "Quantum of Solace". EON Productions who are producing the film made the announcement today at Pinewood Studios, where production for the film has been under way since last year. The name of the film was inspired by a short story (of the same name) from For Your Eyes Only by Bond creator, Ian Fleming.  Hypothesis: James Bond was created by Ian Fleming.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis follows from the premise because it is a logical inference based on the given information. The premise states that the 22nd James Bond film is called "Quantum of Solace" and that it was announced by EON Productions, which is the production company that produced the previous Bond films.   Given that EON Productions is the same company that produced the previous Bond films, it is reasonable to infer that they are responsible for the production of the new film.   Additionally, the fact that the film was inspired by a short story (For Your Eyes Only) by Ian Fleming suggests that the film will likely follow the same formula and style as the previous Bond films, which is consistent with the "Quantum of Solace" title, which is also a reference to a classic Bond film.
1760545637	1760545638	Premise: The gastric bypass operation, also known as stomach stapling, has become the most common surgical procedure for treating obesity.  Hypothesis: Obesity is medically treated.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Obesity is medically treated" does not follow from the premise "The gastric bypass operation, also known as stomach stapling, has become the most common surgical procedure for treating obesity."   The premise states that gastric bypass surgery is a common treatment for obesity, but it does not provide sufficient information to conclude that obesity is a medical condition that can be treated with this surgery.  In other words, the premise is describing a specific medical treatment, but it does not imply that obesity is a medical condition that can be treated with gastric bypass surgery. Obesity is a complex condition that can have various causes and underlying health issues, and gastric bypass surgery is just one of many treatment options for weight loss.
1760545638	1760545638	Premise: The cost of the consumer of the United States fell in June.  Hypothesis: U.S. consumer spending dived in June.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the cost of the consumer of the United States fell in June. This implies that the cost of goods and services purchased by consumers in the United States decreased, but it does not directly imply that the overall cost of consumer spending decreased.  To follow the hypothesis, the premise would need to state that the cost of consumer spending in the United States actually decreased. In other words, the premise should be phrased as "Consumer spending in the United States decreased in June" rather than "The cost of the consumer of the United States fell in June".  Here's an example of how the hypothesis could be rephrased:  Hypothesis: U.S. consumer spending decreased in June.  Premise: The cost of the consumer of the United States fell in June.  This revised premise states that the cost of consumer spending in the United States actually decreased, which is what the hypothesis is supposed to follow.
1760545638	1760545639	Premise: The former leader of Iraq was rushed to hospital last Sunday after refusing to eat for sixteen days. But according to news agencies, he has ended the hunger strike by eating lunch at the court in Baghdad. "Saddam ate beef and rice and cola with bread which he brought from hospital," one source told Reuters news agency. He was fasting with three co-defendants, and they were demanding more security for their defence lawyers, three of whom have been murdered.  Hypothesis: Some Australians have fasted to protest.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that the former leader of Iraq is eating after a hunger strike, but it does not provide information about his initial decision to fast. The premise only states that he ended the hunger strike and ate lunch at the court, but it does not explain why he initially started the hunger strike or what motivated him to refuse food for 16 days.  To test the hypothesis, more information would be needed to understand why the former leader of Iraq initially started the hunger strike and what his motivations were.
1760545639	1760545639	Premise: Sonia Gandhi can be defeated in the next elections in India by BJP.  Hypothesis: Sonia Gandhi is defeated by BJP.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis follows from the premise. Here's why:  1. The premise states that Sonia Gandhi can be defeated in the next elections in India by BJP.  This implies that there is a reasonable possibility that Sonia Gandhi might face defeat in the elections, which is a necessary condition for the hypothesis to hold.  2. If the premise is true, then it is possible for Sonia Gandhi to be defeated by BJP.  This is a logical consequence of the premise, as if Sonia Gandhi is defeated, it is a possible scenario that could occur.  3. Therefore, the premise logically implies the hypothesis, making it a necessary and sufficient condition for the hypothesis to be true.  In other words, if Sonia Gandhi can be defeated by BJP, then the premise is true, and the hypothesis follows.
1760545639	1760545640	Premise: Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has said that Mahmoud Abbas is a man that Israel can do business with.  Hypothesis: Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, may be someone Israel can talk with.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Mahmoud Abbas may be someone Israel can talk with" does not necessarily follow from the premise "Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said that Mahmoud Abbas is a man that Israel can do business with."  The premise is true, but it does not provide any information about Abbas' ability to engage in business. It only states that Sharon said Abbas is someone Israel can do business with, without specifying what kind of business.  Therefore, we cannot conclude that Abbas can do business with Israel based solely on Sharon's statement.
1760545640	1760545640	Premise: The Tempe Hometown Premiere will have all the trappings of a mega-Hollywood  event including red carpet arrivals, klieg lights, screaming fans, paparazzi and  media coverage of the film`s stars headed by Wolverine himself, Hugh Jackman and  including Liev Schreiber, Ryan Reynolds, Taylor Kitsch, Lynn Collins, will.i.am  and director Gavin Hood.  Following a hard-fought contest stretching over thousands of cities and towns  across the United States, Tempe emerged triumphant in a far-reaching, citywide  bid to nab the gala event. Mayor Hugh Hallman himself rallied the community,  which stepped up with dozens of videos that were posted on YouTube.  Hypothesis: Hugh Jackman plays the role of Wolverine in the movie.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis follows from the premise. The premise mentions that the event is a "mega-Hollywood event" and that Wolverine (played by Hugh Jackman) is one of the stars, but it doesn't specify that the event is a movie premiere. Therefore, the hypothesis that Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine is not necessarily implied by the premise. However, it is a reasonable inference based on the context, as the premise mentions that the event is a "mega-Hollywood event" and Wolverine is mentioned as one of the stars, which is consistent with the typical convention of a movie premiere.
1760545640	1760545641	Premise: In October, however, amid rising tensions between the government and opposition groups, a car bomb seriously injured an opposition politician and killed his driver, in Beirut.  Hypothesis: A member of the opposition was injured in a car bomb attack in Beirut.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise states that "In October, however, amid rising tensions between the government and opposition groups, a car bomb seriously injured an opposition politician and killed his driver." This implies that there was a car bomb attack. The hypothesis, "A member of the opposition was injured in a car bomb attack in Beirut," is a direct consequence of the premise, as it directly states the result of the car bomb attack.   In other words, the premise sets the context and conditions for the hypothesis to be true, and the hypothesis provides the specific instance that confirms the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise.
1760545641	1760545641	Premise: Weinstock painstakingly reviewed dozens of studies for evidence of any link between sunscreen use and either an increase or decrease in melanoma.  Hypothesis: skin cancer numbers increase.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis that skin cancer numbers increase with sunscreen use does not follow from the premise. The premise is incorrect because it suggests that the premise itself is true, which is not the case.  The premise states that weinstock "reviewed dozens of studies" for evidence of an increase in melanoma, but it does not imply that the studies found an increase. In fact, the premise is more likely to suggest that the premise is true, and that there is no evidence to support a link between sunscreen use and melanoma.  A correct hypothesis would be that the premise is false, and that the actual relationship between sunscreen use and melanoma is not supported by the evidence. In other words, the premise is based on a flawed assumption, and we need to re-examine the evidence to determine if there is a link between sunscreen use and melanoma.
1760545641	1760545642	Premise: Most people are familiar with the idea of St. Bernards or other dogs taking part in rescue and recovery efforts. Robots might also take part in search and rescue missions.  Hypothesis: Robots are used to find missing victims.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Robots are used to find missing victims" follows from the premise "Most people are familiar with the idea of St. Bernards or other dogs taking part in rescue and recovery efforts." Here's why:  1. The premise establishes a common scenario in which dogs are involved in rescue and recovery efforts. 2. The premise implies that people are aware of the capabilities and limitations of dogs in these situations. 3. Dogs, like St. Bernards, are known for their keen sense of smell, strength, and tracking abilities, which are often used in search and rescue operations. 4. The premise suggests that the effectiveness of these search and rescue efforts relies on the involvement of dogs, which implies that robots or other machines might be used to assist in the process. 5. The premise implies that the involvement of robots or other machines in search and rescue efforts is not just a hypothetical or unrelated concept, but a plausible one, given the capabilities of these machines.  Therefore, the hypothesis follows logically from the premise.
1760545642	1760545642	Premise: Illinois born Charlton Heston was a 27-year-old actor from Broadway and television when he arrived in Hollywood for a five-picture contract with Hal Wallis.  Hypothesis: Charlton Heston was born in Illinois.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise is that Charlton Heston arrived in Hollywood for a five-picture contract with Hal Wallis.   However, the premise does not provide any information about Charlton Heston's birthplace, which is Illinois. Therefore, we cannot conclude that he was born in Illinois based solely on this premise.  The hypothesis, "Charlton Heston was born in Illinois," cannot be logically derived from the premise.
1760545642	1760545643	Premise: Ruth's 1927 single season record of 60 home runs stood unsurpassed until Roger Maris hit 61 in 1961.  Hypothesis: Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs in his lifetime.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Ruth's 1927 single-season record of 60 home runs stood unsurpassed until Roger Maris hit 61 in 1961. However, Maris' record was actually broken by Babe Ruth himself in 1927, not just Ruth.   Ruth's 1927 season was a record-breaking season that stood until Maris hit 61 in 1961, but Ruth's 1927 season was also a record-breaking season, and Maris' record was not yet complete when Ruth retired.
1760545643	1760545643	Premise: The German technology was employed to build Shanghai's existing maglev line, the first in the world to be used commercially.  Hypothesis: Maglev is commercially used.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This statement does not follow logically from the premise. The premise only mentions that the German technology was employed to build Shanghai's maglev line, but it does not explicitly state that the maglev technology itself is being used commercially.   The premise could be rephrased as: "German technology was used to build Shanghai's maglev line." In this revised premise, it is implied that the technology is being used, but the statement "is being used commercially" is not directly supported.
1760545643	1760545643	Premise: SEATTLE — United Nations gang leader Clay Roueche should spend at least 30 years behind bars after his surprise guilty plea here Tuesday for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine, marijuana and illicit drug profits, U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Sullivan said. Sullivan said outside court that Roueche's leadership of the violent UN gang and the sophistication of the international drug conspiracy will all be factors used to argue for a longer sentence — up to life — for the 33-year-old Canadian. And he stressed that the plea agreement reached with Roueche did not include "any kind of break with respect to sentencing.".  Hypothesis: Clay Roueche is 33 years old.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Clay Roueche should spend at least 30 years behind bars, but it does not provide any information about his current age. The correct age of Roueche is not mentioned in the premise, and it is only stated that he is 33 years old.
1760545643	1760545643	Premise: Baker's voice will replace the earlier computer-synthesized voice that was previously used. BT said that his voice was chosen as it was instantly recognisable. It took him 11 days to record 11,593 phrases and sounds which could then be broken down and reassembled by a computer to make new words. It then took five months to process these recordings to make a workable service. BT have said that there will be no barriers as to what Tom Baker's voice can 'say', including rude words. "What appeals to me most is the thought that I will be bringing good news to people whether it is a cheeky message, a birthday greeting, or just a quick hello," said Baker.  Hypothesis: Tom Baker works for BT.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise only mentions that Baker's voice is being used, but it does not state that he works for BT.
1760545643	1760545644	Premise: The Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for the selection of the candidates and the choice of Prize Winners for the Peace Prize. The Committee is composed of five members appointed by the Storting (Norwegian parliament). The Peace Prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway and not in Stockholm, Sweden like the other Nobel Prizes.  Hypothesis: Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	This statement follows from the premise. Here's why:  1. The premise states that the Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for the selection of the candidates and the choice of Prize Winners for the Peace Prize. 2. The committee is composed of five members appointed by the Storting (Norwegian parliament). 3. The Peace Prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway.  From these statements, it can be inferred that the Norwegian Nobel Committee is the one responsible for selecting the Peace Prize candidates and making the final decision on who should win. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the Norwegian Nobel Committee has chosen the candidates for the Peace Prize.
1760545644	1760545644	Premise: More than 150 dolphins, marine turtles and beaked whales have been washed up dead on beaches in Africa.  Hypothesis: Dead dolphins, turtles and whales have been found on African beaches.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that "More than 150 dolphins, marine turtles and beaked whales have been washed up dead on beaches in Africa." However, this premise only specifies that these animals have washed up dead, without specifying the number of dead animals. The premise does not provide any information about the quantity of the animals washed up.  The hypothesis that the hypothesis follows from the premise is a logical fallacy called "affirming the consequent" or "consequentism". It assumes that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, the premise provides a specific number (more than 150) but does not guarantee that the conclusion will also be true (more than 150 animals washed up dead).
