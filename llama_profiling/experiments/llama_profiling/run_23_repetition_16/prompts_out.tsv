In the sentence above, does ""them"" refer to ""mothers""? Explain your choice."	"In this sentence, ""them"" refers to ""mothers"".   This is because ""them"" is a plural pronoun, and it is used to refer to a group of people, in this case, both ""Arthur"" and ""Celeste"". The sentence is saying that the mothers of both Arthur and Celeste have come to the town, so ""them"" is referring to the group of mothers, rather than just one mother."	89
1760543912	1760543913	"Mark was close to Mr. Singer 's heels. He heard him calling for the captain, promising him, in the jargon everyone talked that night, that not one thing should be damaged on the ship except only the ammunition, but the captain and all his crew had best stay in the cabin until the work was over  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Mr. Singer""? Explain your choice."	"The pronoun ""He"" in the sentence refers to ""Mr. Singer"".   The reason is that ""He"" is a subject pronoun, which is used to refer to a person who is performing an action or being addressed. In this case, the action is being called for, and the subject is Mr. Singer. Since the subject is a person, the pronoun ""He"" is used to refer to that person.  In contrast, ""it"" is an object pronoun, which refers to a thing or a person or place that receives the action. It is not used in this sentence, so ""it"" would not be the correct pronoun to refer to Mr. Singer in this context."	145

"In the sentence, ""He"" refers to ""Bill"".   This is because ""He"" is an object pronoun, which is used to refer to a person who is the object of a verb, action, or sentence. In this case, ""He"" is referring to the person who is doing the action (toying with the injured bird), rather than the person being acted upon (Dan)."	82
1760543913	1760543914	"Sam Goodman 's biography of the Spartan general Xenophanes conveys a vivid sense of the difficulties he faced in his childhood.

Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""They"" refers to ""Pam's parents.""   The pronoun ""They"" is used to refer to a group or a class of people, in this case, Pam's parents. It is an objective pronoun, which is used to describe a person or a group of people without indicating their individual identity. In this sentence, ""They"" is describing the parents, not just Pam, as the sentence is referring to the parents in general.  So, ""They"" is a collective pronoun used to emphasize the collective action of Pam's parents, rather than just her individual parents."	125
1760543914	1760543914	"Bob paid for Charlie 's college education, but now Charlie acts as though it never happened. He is very hurt.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Bob""?

"In the sentence, ""she"" refers to ""Emma"". The pronoun ""she"" is a third-person singular pronoun, which is used to refer to a single person. Since there is only one person being referred to in the sentence, ""she"" is the correct pronoun to use.  In contrast, ""Janie"" is a proper noun, referring to a specific person's name."	82
1760543915	1760543915	"Sam's drawing was hung just above Tina's and it did look much better with another one below it.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""Sam's drawing""? Explain your choice."	"In this sentence, ""it"" is a pronoun, and it refers to ""Sam's drawing."" This is because ""it"" is an object pronoun, which is used to refer to a noun that has already been mentioned in the sentence. In this case, ""it"" is describing the ""drawing"" that is being hung.  The sentence states ""Sam's drawing was hung just above Tina's"", so we know that the drawing belongs to Sam, not Tina. Therefore, the correct pronoun to use would be ""Sam's"" instead of ""it""."	116

"In the sentence, ""he"" refers to ""the lawyer"". This is because ""he"" is a pronoun that is a masculine pronoun, and it is typically used to refer to a male person. The use of ""he"" in the sentence indicates that the speaker is referring to the lawyer as a male individual.  It's worth noting that the pronoun ""he"" can also be used as a generic term for a person, but in this context, it is being used to refer to a specific person, the lawyer."	109
1760543916	1760543916	"Sam took French classes from Adam , because he was eager to speak it fluently.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Sam""? Explain your choice."

1760543917	1760543917	"After I saw Bill catching flies and pulling off their wings, I boxed his ears. I showed the master the flies, some crushed and some crawling about helpless, and I showed him the wings on the window sill. I never saw him so angry before; but as Bill was still howling and whining, like the coward that he was, he did not give him any more punishment of that kind, but set him up on a stool for the rest of the afternoon, and said that he should not go out to play for that week.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""the master""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""he"" refers to the master. The pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to the person Bill was punishing, who is likely the master of the house or the person in charge. This is an example of a pronoun shift, where the pronoun changes from ""he"" to ""him"" in a sentence to refer to a person who is not directly mentioned or is unknown.  In this context, the master is implied to be someone in charge, such as a father, owner, or caretaker, and the pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to this person."	125

"In the sentence ""Joan made sure to thank Susan for all the help she had given,"" the pronoun ""she"" refers to ""Susan."" This is because ""she"" is a singular pronoun, and in this context, it is the correct choice to refer to a single person, in this case, Susan.  If ""she"" were to refer to Joan, it would be a case of reflexive pronoun, where the subject of the sentence is the object of the verb ""made."" In this case, the sentence would be ""Joan made thank Susan for all the help she had given.""  The use of ""she"" to refer to Susan creates a clear and grammatically correct sentence structure, and it is the most natural choice in this context."	157

In other words, ""it"" is a pronoun that refers to a general noun, rather than a specific object."	114
1760543919	1760543919	"Beth didn't get angry with Sally , who had cut her off, because she stopped and counted to ten.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Beth""? Explain your choice."

1760543919	1760543919	"The lawyer asked the witness a question, but he was reluctant to repeat it.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""the lawyer""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""he"" refers to the ""lawyer."" This is because the pronoun ""he"" is an object pronoun, which is used to refer to a person or entity that is receiving the action of the verb in the sentence. Since the sentence states that the lawyer asked the witness a question, ""he"" is the correct pronoun to use in this context, as it is the one performing the action.  The pronoun ""he"" is an object pronoun because it receives the action of the verb ""asked,"" and in this case, the verb is in the passive voice, meaning the subject (the lawyer) is the doer of the action, and the object is the witness."	147
1760543919	1760543920	"Sir Clifford wants me to find him a new groom , about twenty or twenty-one, who knows his business. His old coachman is getting feeble, and he wants a man to work with him and get into his ways, who would be able, when the old man was pensioned off, to step into his place  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""new groom""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""his"" refers to ""old coachman"".   The word ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, which means it shows that something belongs to him. In this context, ""his"" indicates that the old coachman is the one who belongs to Clifford. Since the old coachman is getting feeble, Clifford wants someone who will take his place and continue his work. Therefore, ""his"" is used to refer to the old coachman.  If ""his"" were to refer to a new groom, it would not make sense in this context, as it would imply that the new groom is the one who belongs to Clifford, rather than the old coachman."	142
1760543920	1760543920	"Since it was raining, I carried the newspaper over my backpack to keep it dry.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""The newspaper""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence ""Since it was raining, I carried the newspaper over my backpack to keep it dry,"" ""it"" refers to ""The newspaper"".   Here's why:  - ""It"" is a pronoun that is typically used to refer to a specific noun that is already known to the listener or reader. In this sentence, ""it"" refers to ""The newspaper"" because the speaker is already knowing that it's a newspaper and is carrying it to keep it dry.

"In the sentence, ""he"" refers to ""The con artist"".   The pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to the person being described, which is ""The con artist"". This is because ""he"" is an objective pronoun, which refers to an object or an action, whereas ""I"" is an subject pronoun, which refers to the person performing the action. In this case, ""The con artist"" is the object of the verb ""fooling"", and ""he"" is the subject of the sentence.  In other words, ""he"" is used to refer to the person who is performing the action of fooling, rather than the person who is being fooled. This is a common technique used in English to distinguish between the subject and object of a sentence."	161
1760543921	1760543921	"The boy continued to whip the pony , and eventually the pony threw him over. John laughed out quite loud. ""Served him right,"" he said.

1760543922	1760543922	"The actress used to be named Terpsichore , but she changed it to Tina a few years ago, because she figured it was easier to pronounce.

"In this sentence, ""his"" refers to ""Warren"".   The reason is that ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, indicating that the subject of the sentence (Mark) is possessed by or owns something. In this case, the subject is ""Mark"", which is the doer of the action described in the sentence. Therefore, ""his"" is a possessive pronoun that indicates that Mark is the owner of the hand that was on his shoulder."	96
1760543922	1760543923	"Fred covered his eyes with his hands , because the wind was blowing sand around. He lowered them when the wind stopped.

The pronoun ""them"" is a third-person plural pronoun, which is used to refer to a group of people or objects, in this case, ""His hands"". It is not a possessive pronoun, which would refer to something belonging to him (e.g. ""His hand"").  So, ""them"" is a plural pronoun used to indicate a group of people or objects, in this case, ""His hands""."	104
1760543923	1760543923	"Sir Clifford wants me to find him a new groom , about twenty or twenty-one, who knows his business.

Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""his"" refers to ""old coachman"".  The reason for this choice is that ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, indicating that the old coachman is the one who belongs to or owns something. In this context, ""his"" is used to show possession, meaning that the old coachman is the one who has the role, responsibility, or authority.  The sentence would be grammatically correct and idiomatic if the subject of the sentence were ""old coachman"". However, since the subject is actually ""Sir Clifford"", the possessive pronoun ""his"" is used to indicate that Sir Clifford is the one who owns or belongs to the coachman."	142

"In this sentence, ""she"" is a reflexive pronoun, specifically an objective accusative case. It is used to describe an action that is happening to someone else, rather than to the person performing the action.  In this case, ""she"" is referring to the crop duster, which is the one passing over Susan, not the person being referred to. The pronoun ""she"" is a clear example of an objective accusative case, where the subject of the sentence is the object (the crop duster) and the verb is in the accusative case, indicating that the action is happening to the object.  So, the sentence is saying that the crop duster (the object) is passing over Susan (the subject)."	152
1760543924	1760543924	"Frank was upset with Tom because the toaster he had bought from him didn't work.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Tom""? Explain your choice."

The pronoun ""they"" is a third-person plural pronoun, which is used to refer to a group of people, in this case, the city councilmen. The plural form of the noun ""councilman"" is ""councilmen"", and using ""they"" instead of ""he"" or ""she"" would not make grammatical sense in this context.

The sentence is written in a formal and somewhat archaic style, which suggests that it is written from the perspective of a servant or an observer of a master, rather than the master himself. The use of the formal second-person pronoun ""he"" is typical of a narrative style, where the narrator is observing the actions of someone else, rather than directly addressing the subject.  The master is not directly involved in the actions being described, but is instead being observed and critiqued by the narrator. The use of the pronoun ""he"" emphasizes the distance and objectivity of the narrator's perspective."	139
