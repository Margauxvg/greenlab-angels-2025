The pronoun ""his"" is a possessive form of the noun ""Billy"". When ""his"" is used as a possessive pronoun, it indicates that the object of the sentence belongs to Billy.

"In the sentence, ""it"" refers to the cup. This is because the pronoun ""it"" is a common object pronoun, and in this context, it is being used to refer to the cup, rather than the bottle. This is a common way to use ""it"" in English, especially in informal or everyday language.  In this sentence, ""it"" is the subject of the verb ""poured"", which is performing the action of filling the cup. Therefore, ""it"" refers to the cup, rather than the bottle.  This is a common usage of ""it"" that is often referred to as ""the it-form"" or ""object it"", which is used to refer to an object or entity that is not the subject of the sentence."	157

The pronoun ""him"" is a third-person singular pronoun, which is used to refer to a person, and in this case, it is referring to Bill, a specific individual who has been hired by John to take care of him.

"Yes, in the sentence ""Carol believed that Rebecca regretted that she had stolen the watch,"" the pronoun ""she"" refers to ""Rebecca.""   The reason for this is that ""she"" is a possessive pronoun, which is used to indicate that the object belongs to the subject.

This is because the word ""it"" is an indefinite pronoun, which is used to refer to a specific object or concept. In this case, ""it"" is clearly referring to the table, as it is the location where the food and other items are piled up.

Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""they"" refers to ""onions."" This is an example of a pronoun reference error, also known as a pronoun ambiguity.   The choice of ""they"" is ambiguous because the sentence is using the pronoun ""they"" to refer to ""onions"" instead of ""hamburgers."" This is a result of the sentence structure and the context in which the pronoun is used.  In the original sentence, ""I thought they were onions"" implies that the speaker is referring to a group of people, likely a group of people eating hamburgers, and the speaker believes they are actually onions. However, by using the pronoun ""they,"" the sentence is shifting the focus to a different group of people, which is the people eating hamburgers."	160

In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""the master""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""he"" refers to ""Bill"".

The pronoun ""him"" is a reflexive pronoun, which is used to refer back to the person or people affected by an action, in this case, the master.  The reason for this choice is that ""him"" is the indirect object of the sentence, and in this case, it is the master who is the direct object of the verb ""showed"". The sentence is saying that the master showed the flies to the speaker, and then showed them to Bill, and so on. The master is the one being referred to by ""him"".  This usage of ""him"" is a common way to refer to the person affected by an action in a sentence, and it is often used in informal writing and speech. In formal writing, it's generally safer to use ""the master"" instead, as it is more direct and clear.  In the original sentence, using ""him"" instead of ""the master"" would change the intended meaning, as it would imply that the master was the one being referred to by ""him"", rather than the person being addressed."	232
