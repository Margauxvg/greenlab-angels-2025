1760464864	1760464865	"The mothers of Arthur and Celeste have come to the town to fetch them. They are very happy to have them back, but they scold them just the same because they ran away.  In the sentence above, does ""them"" refer to ""mothers""? Explain your choice."	"In this sentence, ""them"" refers to ""mothers"".   This is because ""them"" is a plural pronoun, and it is used to refer to a group of people, in this case, both ""Arthur"" and ""Celeste"". The sentence is saying that the mothers of both Arthur and Celeste have come to the town, so ""them"" is referring to the group of mothers, rather than just one mother."	89	1.0
1760464865	1760464865	"Mark was close to Mr. Singer 's heels. He heard him calling for the captain, promising him, in the jargon everyone talked that night, that not one thing should be damaged on the ship except only the ammunition, but the captain and all his crew had best stay in the cabin until the work was over  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Mr. Singer""? Explain your choice."	"The pronoun ""He"" in the sentence refers to ""Mr. Singer"".   The reason is that ""He"" is a subject pronoun, which is used to refer to a person who is performing an action or being addressed. In this case, the action is ""promising"" and the subject is ""Mr. Singer"".   The pronoun ""He"" is in the third person, indicating that it is referring to a person, specifically Mr. Singer, rather than a person performing the action.   This is a clear example of the use of ""He"" as a third-person pronoun, which is used to refer to a person who is performing an action or being addressed."	140	0.8333333333333334
1760464865	1760464865	"The pony behaved well, sir, and showed no vice; but at last he just threw up his heels and tipped the young gentleman into the thorn hedge. He wanted me to help him out, but I hope you will excuse me, sir, I did not feel inclined to do so.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""young gentleman""? Explain your choice."	"In this sentence, ""He"" refers to ""young gentleman"".   The reason is that the pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to a male person, and in the context of the sentence, it is clear that the pony is a male animal. The sentence is likely referring to a male pony.   The phrase ""young gentleman"" is also a idiomatic expression meaning ""a young man"" or ""a male person of good breeding"". In this context, it is being used to describe the pony's age and sex."	108	
1760464865	1760464866	"I poured water from the bottle into the cup until it was full.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""the cup""? Explain your choice."	"In this sentence, ""it"" refers to ""the cup"". This is because ""it"" is a pronoun, and pronouns typically refer to the object or subject of a sentence. In this case, ""it"" is a pronoun that is performing the action of pouring water from the bottle into the cup, so it's referring to the cup.  If ""it"" were to refer to ""the cup"" (as in ""the cup is pouring water""), the sentence would be ambiguous, as it would be unclear which cup is being referred to."	114

"In the sentence, ""He"" refers to ""Bill"".   This is because the subject of the sentence is ""Dan"", and the pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to Dan because Dan is the one performing the action of stopping Bill from toying with the injured bird. In this context, ""he"" is a reflexive pronoun, which is used when the subject is the one performing the action, rather than the one being acted upon."	93

In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Goodman""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""he"" refers to ""Xenophanes"". This is because the pronoun ""he"" is a third-person singular pronoun, which is used to refer to a male person or a general. In this context, the pronoun ""he"" is likely referring to the Spartan general Xenophanes, as it is the more grammatically correct and commonly used form of address for a general in ancient Greek.  In ancient Greek, the first-person singular pronoun is ""io"" (Ἰω), which is used to refer to the speaker or the subject of the sentence. Using ""he"" instead of ""io"" would be incorrect in this context."	139

This is because ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, indicating that the toy belongs to Toby. In this context, ""his"" is used to show that the toy is something that belongs to Toby, rather than something that belongs to Billy.  The possessive pronoun ""his"" is used when we are describing something that belongs to someone, and it is typically followed by the name of the person. So, in this case, ""his"" is used to emphasize that the toy belongs to Toby, and it's the correct choice to use in this context."	129	
1760464868	1760464868	"Emma did not pass the ball to Janie although she was open.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Janie""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence ""Emma did not pass the ball to Janie although she was open,"" the pronoun ""she"" refers to ""Janie"".   This is because ""she"" is an object pronoun, which refers to a noun that is receiving the action of the verb.

So, ""she"" is used to describe Janie, the person receiving the action, whereas ""Emma"" is used to describe the one performing the action.

Explain your choice."	"The word ""it"" in the sentence refers to ""Sam's drawing"". This is because ""it"" is an object pronoun, and in this context, ""it"" is referring to the drawing, which is the object that is being hung.   The sentence implies that the drawing is being hung above Tina's, so it's logical that ""it"" refers to the drawing, not Sam's drawing."	83

I never saw him so angry before; but as Bill was still howling and whining, like the coward that he was, he did not give him any more punishment of that kind, but set him up on a stool for the rest of the afternoon, and said that he should not go out to play for that week.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""the master""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""he"" refers to ""the master"".   The pronoun ""he"" is a third-person singular pronoun, which is used to refer to a male person or animal.

Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""it"" refers to ""The roof"". This is because ""it"" is an object pronoun, and it is used to refer to a specific, tangible object. In this context, ""it"" is referring to the tree that fell down, which is an object.  In contrast, ""The roof"" is a noun phrase, and ""it"" is used to refer to the roof itself, rather than the tree.

This is an example of a pronoun reference, where ""it"" refers to a specific object, rather than the general category of ""roof""."	143

Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""his"" refers to ""old coachman"".   The reason for this choice is that ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, which is used to indicate that the subject (in this case, the old coachman) is the one performing the action (being pensioned off).   By saying ""his"", the sentence is emphasizing that the old coachman is the one who will be replaced by the new groom.

"In the sentence, ""it"" refers to ""The newspaper."" This is because the pronoun ""it"" is an object pronoun, and in this context, it is describing the object that you carried the newspaper over your backpack. In other words, ""it"" is the object that is being carried, rather than the subject (the newspaper itself).  In the sentence, ""it"" is used to refer to the thing that the speaker is doing (carrying the newspaper), rather than the newspaper itself. This is a common usage of object pronouns like ""it"" to refer to the object being acted upon."	126

The pronoun ""he"" is an object pronoun, which is used to refer to a person or thing that is the direct object of the verb in the sentence. In this case, ""he"" is referring to ""The con artist"" because it is the one who is doing the action of fooling Sam, and the sentence is stating that the outcome of this action is about The con artist.  It's worth noting that in this sentence, ""he"" is also a pronoun that can be used as a subject pronoun, but in this context, it's more likely that ""he"" is being used as an object pronoun to refer to The con artist, indicating that the outcome of the action is about The con artist."	189

1760464874	1760464874	"The fish ate the worm . It was tasty.  In the sentence above, does ""It"" refer to ""The worm""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence ""The fish ate the worm. It was tasty,"" the pronoun ""It"" refers to ""The worm.""   This is because ""It"" is a pronoun that is typically used as a subject or object in a sentence. In this case, ""It"" is the subject of the sentence, which is ""The fish."" Since ""The fish"" is the subject performing the action of eating the worm, ""It"" is used to refer to the action itself, not the worm.  The use of ""It"" here is a common and conventional way to refer to the subject of a sentence, especially when the subject is performing an action."	135

In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""Terpsichore""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""it"" refers to ""Terpsichore"". The pronoun ""it"" is an indefinite pronoun that can refer to either Terpsichore or Tina.   However, the context of the sentence suggests that ""it"" is referring to Terpsichore because it's a more formal or old-fashioned term for her. ""Terpsichore"" is a proper noun, and it's unlikely that ""it"" would refer to Tina directly in a casual or informal conversation.  So, while ""it"" could refer to Tina, the context and the formal tone of the sentence make ""Terpsichore"" a more likely choice."	136	
1760464875	1760464875	"So Mark slept. It was daylight when he woke with Warren 's hand upon his shoulder.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Warren""? Explain your choice."	"The correct pronoun to use in this sentence is ""him"", not ""his"".   The word ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, indicating that the subject (Mark) owns something. In this context, ""his"" is referring to Mark's body or physical body, as in ""his hand"".  The possessive pronoun ""his"" is used to show that the subject (Mark) has a particular thing or attribute, whereas ""him"" would refer to a different person altogether.  So, in this sentence, ""his"" is used to refer to Mark's body, making ""his"" the correct choice."	129

Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""his"" refers to ""old coachman"". The pronoun ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, which indicates that the subject of the sentence is something that belongs to the speaker (Clifford).   In this case, ""his"" refers to the old coachman because it shows that the speaker is referring to the person's property, specifically the old coachman. The phrase ""his ways"" is also a possessive phrase that indicates that the old coachman is a part of the old man's identity or characteristics."	113

"In the sentence, ""he"" refers to ""Joe"".   The pronoun ""he"" is a third-person singular pronoun, which is used to refer to a single person. Since Joe is the subject of the sentence and the subject pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to him, it's logical that ""he"" refers to Joe.  Here's an example:  - If ""he"" were to refer to ""Joe"", the sentence would be grammatically incorrect.  - The sentence ""I have written the report"" uses ""I"" as the subject pronoun, not ""he"".  In the case of the original sentence, the pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to Joe, making it clear that the speaker is talking about Joe."	157	
1760464877	1760464877	"As Andrea in the crop duster passed over Susan , she could see the landing strip.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Susan""? Explain your choice."

1760464877	1760464877	"Frank was upset with Tom because the toaster he had bought from him didn't work.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Tom""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""he"" refers to ""Tom"". The pronoun ""he"" is an object pronoun, which is used to refer to a person who has done or is performing an action, and in this case, Tom has done the action of buying a toaster from Frank.  The reason is that ""he"" is used as a direct object in the sentence, indicating that Frank is the one who owns the toaster. The sentence says ""Frank was upset with Tom because the toaster he had bought from him"", which shows that Tom is the one who has been the subject of the action (buying the toaster) and the one who is being blamed for the problem (Frank's upset).

The sentence structure is ""The cat is lying by the mouse hole"", and ""it"" is the subject of this clause.  In the context of the sentence, ""it"" is an objective pronoun because it is not the subject of the sentence, and it is used to describe the cat, rather than the cat itself."	140

Dexter Haven , a pallid young dandy holding a jade-handled walking stick, with a poodle asleep at his feet  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Haven""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""his"" refers to ""Haven"".   The possessive form of the pronoun ""his"" is used when referring to a noun that is already possessive, meaning it indicates that something belongs to the subject. In this case, ""his"" is referring to the person, ""Haven"", indicating that he is the owner or the subject of the sentence."	79	
1760464878	1760464879	"Sir Clifford wants me to find him a new groom , about twenty or twenty-one, who knows his business.
