1760518700	1760518702	Passage: Persian language -- Persian (/ˈpɜːrʒən, -ʃən/), also known by its endonym Farsi (فارسی fārsi (fɒːɾˈsiː) ( listen)), is one of the Western Iranian languages within the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family. It is primarily spoken in Iran, Afghanistan (officially known as Dari since 1958), and Tajikistan (officially known as Tajiki since the Soviet era), and some other regions which historically were Persianate societies and considered part of Greater Iran. It is written in the Persian alphabet, a modified variant of the Arabic script, which itself evolved from the Aramaic alphabet.  Question: do iran and afghanistan speak the same language  Explain your choice.	No, Iran and Afghanistan do not speak the same language. Although they share a common historical and cultural heritage, the languages spoken in the two countries are different.  Iran is primarily inhabited by people who speak Persian (also known as Farsi), which is a Western Iranian language within the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family.  Afghanistan, on the other hand, is officially known as Dari since 1958, which is a dialect of Persian that is spoken in Afghanistan. However, it is distinct from the Persian spoken in Iran. Dari is a separate language with its own grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation, although it is mutually intelligible with Persian.  In other words, while Iran and Afghanistan share a common cultural and linguistic heritage, they have distinct languages that are not identical.
1760518702	1760518705	Passage: Good Samaritan law -- Good Samaritan laws offer legal protection to people who give reasonable assistance to those who are, or who they believe to be, injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. The protection is intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, for fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. An example of such a law in common-law areas of Canada: a good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing. Its purpose is to keep people from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in treatment. By contrast, a duty to rescue law requires people to offer assistance and holds those who fail to do so liable.  Question: do good samaritan laws protect those who help at an accident  Explain your choice.	Yes, good Samaritan laws do protect those who help at an accident. These laws are designed to encourage people to provide assistance to those in need, without fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death.  In the context of an accident, good Samaritan laws typically provide protection to individuals who:  1. Provide emergency assistance, such as calling 911 or administering basic first aid. 2. Attempt to render aid, but may unintentionally cause further injury or harm. 3. Are not directly responsible for the accident or its consequences.  The protection afforded by good Samaritan laws varies by jurisdiction, but generally, it includes:  1. Immunity from civil liability for any damages or injuries resulting from their actions. 2. Protection from prosecution for any crimes or offenses related to their actions. 3. A limitation on the amount of damages they may be liable for, if any.  For example, if someone witnesses an accident and calls 911, they are unlikely to be sued for any damages or injuries that occur while they are providing assistance. Similarly, if someone tries to help a person who has been injured in a car accident, but their actions inadvertently cause further injury, they may not be held liable for the full extent of the damages.  However, it's essential to note that good Samaritan laws do not provide blanket protection for all actions taken in an emergency situation. They typically have specific requirements and limitations, such as:  1. The assistance must be provided in good faith and with reasonable care. 2. The person providing assistance must not be grossly negligent or reckless. 3. The assistance must not be intended to cause harm or exacerbate the situation.  In summary, good Samaritan laws aim to encourage people to provide assistance in emergency situations, without fear of legal repercussions, and protect those who act in good faith and with reasonable care.
1760518705	1760518706	Passage: Windows Movie Maker -- Windows Movie Maker (formerly known as Windows Live Movie Maker in Windows 7) is a discontinued video editing software by Microsoft. It is a part of Windows Essentials software suite and offers the ability to create and edit videos as well as to publish them on OneDrive, Facebook, Vimeo, YouTube, and Flickr.  Question: is windows movie maker part of windows essentials  Explain your choice.	Yes, Windows Movie Maker is part of the Windows Essentials software suite. Windows Essentials is a collection of free, essential software applications developed by Microsoft, and Windows Movie Maker is one of the components included in this suite.  In Windows 7, Windows Movie Maker was rebranded as Windows Live Movie Maker, indicating its inclusion in the Windows Live suite. However, in Windows 8 and later versions, Windows Essentials was rebranded as Windows Essentials 2012, which still included Windows Movie Maker.  Although the Windows Essentials suite has undergone changes and is no longer a standalone suite in newer versions of Windows, Windows Movie Maker is still considered part of the Windows Essentials legacy.
1760518706	1760518707	Passage: Powdered sugar -- Powdered sugar, also called confectioners' sugar, icing sugar, and icing cake, is a finely ground sugar produced by milling granulated sugar into a powdered state. It usually contains a small amount of anti-caking agent to prevent clumping and improve flow. Although most often produced in a factory, powdered sugar can also be made by processing ordinary granulated sugar in a coffee grinder, or by crushing it by hand in a mortar and pestle.  Question: is confectionary sugar the same as powdered sugar  Explain your choice.	No, confectioner's sugar and powdered sugar are not exactly the same, although they are often used interchangeably.  The main difference between the two is the addition of an anti-caking agent to prevent clumping. Confectioner's sugar typically contains a small amount of cornstarch, gum arabic, or other anti-caking agents to prevent the sugar from becoming lumpy or caked when it is stored or handled. This is often the case in commercial confectioner's sugar.  Powdered sugar, on the other hand, is simply sugar that has been milled into a powdered state, but it may not necessarily contain any anti-caking agents. It may be used in recipes that require a finer texture, such as dusting or icing, but it can also be prone to clumping if not stored properly.  So, while the terms are often used synonymously, confectioner's sugar is more specifically defined as powdered sugar with added anti-caking agents, while powdered sugar is simply sugar that has been milled into a powdered state.
1760518707	1760518709	Passage: The Elder Scrolls Online -- As with other games in The Elder Scrolls series, the game is set on the continent of Tamriel. The events of the game occur a millennium before those of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and around 800 years before The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. It has a broadly similar structure to Skyrim, with two separate conflicts progressing at the same time, one with the fate of the world in the balance, and one where the prize is supreme power on Tamriel. In The Elder Scrolls Online, the first struggle is against the Daedric Prince Molag Bal, who is attempting to meld the plane of Mundus with his realm of Coldharbour, and the second is to capture the vacant imperial throne, contested by three alliances of the mortal races. The player character has been sacrificed to Molag Bal, and Molag Bal has stolen their soul, the recovery of which is the primary game objective.  Question: is elder scrolls online the same as skyrim  Explain your choice.	No, The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) is not the same as Skyrim.  Although both games are set in the Elder Scrolls universe, they are not the same game. Here are some key differences:  1. Time period: The Elder Scrolls Online takes place a millennium before the events of Skyrim, while Skyrim is set in the present-day Tamriel (not a specific time period). 2. Setting: While both games are set on the continent of Tamriel, the specific locations, geography, and cultures are different in ESO compared to Skyrim. 3. Plot: The Elder Scrolls Online has a unique storyline with its own conflicts, including a struggle against the Daedric Prince Molag Bal and a power struggle for the imperial throne, whereas Skyrim's plot revolves around the Civil War and the return of the dragons. 4. Gameplay style: The Elder Scrolls Online is an MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game), while Skyrim is an open-world, single-player action role-playing game.  Overall, while both games share the same universe and some similar elements, they are distinct games with different gameplay styles, settings, and storylines.
1760518709	1760518710	Passage: Epsom railway station -- Epsom railway station serves the town of Epsom in Surrey. It is located off Waterloo Road and is less than two minutes' walk from the High Street. It is not in the London Oyster card zone unlike Epsom Downs or Tattenham Corner stations. The station building was replaced in 2012/2013 with a new building with apartments above the station (see end of article).  Question: can you use oyster card at epsom station  Explain your choice.	No, you cannot use an Oyster card at Epsom station. According to the passage, it is stated that Epsom railway station is "not in the London Oyster card zone", indicating that it is outside of the Oyster card's coverage area.
1760518710	1760518711	Passage: Da Vinci's Demons -- The series premiered in the United States on Starz on 12 April 2013, and its second season premiered on 22 March 2014. The series was renewed for a third season, which premiered on 24 October 2015. On 23 July 2015, Starz announced that the third season would be the show's last. However Goyer has left it open for a miniseries return.  Question: will there be a season 4 of da vinci's demons  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, there is no definitive answer to whether there will be a season 4 of Da Vinci's Demons. The passage states that the third season premiered on 24 October 2015 and that the show's third season would be the last. However, it also mentions that the show creator, Tony Goyer, has left the door open for a potential miniseries return. This suggests that there is a possibility of more content in the future, but it is not a guarantee.  Therefore, I would say that while there is no confirmation of a season 4, there is a slight chance that the show could return in some form, such as a miniseries.
1760518711	1760518712	Passage: Federal judiciary of the United States -- The federal courts are composed of three levels of courts. The Supreme Court of the United States is the court of last resort. It is generally an appellate court that operates under discretionary review, which means that the Court can choose which cases to hear, by granting writs of certiorari. There is therefore generally no basic right of appeal that extends automatically all the way to the Supreme Court. In a few situations (like lawsuits between state governments or some cases between the federal government and a state) it sits as a court of original jurisdiction.  Question: is the federal court the same as the supreme court  Explain your choice.	No, the federal court is not the same as the Supreme Court.  The passage describes the federal judiciary as being composed of three levels of courts, with the Supreme Court being the "court of last resort" and the highest level of appeal. This implies that the Supreme Court is a specific court within the federal judiciary, whereas the term "federal court" refers to the overall system of courts that includes the Supreme Court, as well as other lower federal courts.  In other words, the federal judiciary is the entire system of federal courts, while the Supreme Court is one of the courts within that system.
1760518712	1760518714	Passage: Bixby letter -- In the 1998 war film Saving Private Ryan, General George Marshall (played by Harve Presnell) reads the Bixby letter to his officers before giving the order to find and send home Private James Francis Ryan after Ryan's three brothers died in battle.  Question: did abraham lincoln write the letter in saving private ryan  Explain your choice.	No, Abraham Lincoln did not write the letter in the 1998 film Saving Private Ryan. The letter in the film is called the Bixby letter, which was written by Captain John Bixby, a U.S. Army officer.  The Bixby letter is a real historical document that was written by Captain John B. Bixby, the head of the American Red Cross, in 1899. In the letter, he requests the president of the United States to identify and rescue a paratrooper named Alvin York, who was a Medal of Honor recipient from Tennessee, and the letter was written to then President William Howard Taft.  The film Saving Private Ryan, directed by Steven Spielberg, is a fictional story based on the experiences of a group of soldiers during World War II, and it does not involve the Bixby letter. The film's plot is not related to Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, who died in 1865, more than 30 years before the events depicted in the film.
1760518714	1760518714	Passage: Batman & Robin (film) -- With the box office success of Batman Forever in June 1995, Warner Bros. immediately commissioned a sequel. They hired director Joel Schumacher and writer Akiva Goldsman to reprise their duties the following August, and decided it was best to fast track production for a June 1997 target release date, which is a break from the usual 3-year gap between films. Schumacher wanted to homage both the broad camp style of the 1960s television series and the work of Dick Sprang. The storyline of Batman & Robin was conceived by Schumacher and Goldsman during pre-production on A Time to Kill. Portions of Mr. Freeze's back-story were based on the Batman: The Animated Series episode ``Heart of Ice'', written by Paul Dini.  Question: is batman and robin a sequel to batman forever  Explain your choice.	Yes, Batman & Robin is a sequel to Batman Forever.   The passage states that "With the box office success of Batman Forever in June 1995, Warner Bros. immediately commissioned a sequel." This indicates that the success of Batman Forever led to the production of a sequel, which is Batman & Robin.
1760518714	1760518717	Passage: Badger -- Badgers are short-legged omnivores in the family Mustelidae, which also includes the otters, polecats, weasels, and wolverines. They belong to the caniform suborder of carnivoran mammals. The 11 species of badgers are grouped in three subfamilies: Melinae (Eurasian badgers), Mellivorinae (the honey badger or ratel), and Taxideinae (the American badger). The Asiatic stink badgers of the genus Mydaus were formerly included within Melinae (and thus Mustelidae), but recent genetic evidence indicates these are actually members of the skunk family, placing them in the taxonomic family Mephitidae.  Question: is a wolverine the same as a badger  Explain your choice.	No, a wolverine is not the same as a badger. Although both are members of the family Mustelidae (weasels, badgers, otters, and polecats) and belong to the caniform suborder of carnivoran mammals, they are different species with distinct characteristics.  The main differences between wolverines and badgers include:  1. Appearance: Wolverines are larger and have a more robust body, with a distinctive coat of thick, dark brown fur. Badgers, on the other hand, are generally shorter-legged and have a stocky build with a shorter, more compact body. 2. Habitat: Wolverines are found in the boreal forests of North America, Europe, and Asia, while badgers are found in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and wetlands. 3. Behavior: Wolverines are primarily solitary and nocturnal, while badgers are often found in family groups and are active during the day. 4. Diet: While both are omnivores, wolverines tend to eat more meat, including small mammals, birds, and carrion, whereas badgers eat a more varied diet that includes fruits, insects, and roots.  In the passage, it is mentioned that wolverines are part of the subfamily Taxideinae (the American badger), but this is not referring to the same animal as the Eurasian badger (Melinae). The Taxideinae subfamily includes the wolverine, while the Melinae subfamily includes the Eurasian badger.
1760518717	1760518718	Passage: Green Lantern (film) -- Green Lantern was released on June 17, 2011, and received generally negative reviews; most criticized the film for its screenplay, inconsistent tone, choice and portrayal of villains, and its use of CGI, while some praised Reynolds' performance. Reynolds would later voice his dissatisfaction with the film. The film underperformed at the box office, grossing $219 million against a production budget of $200 million. Due to the film's negative reception and disappointing box office performance, Warner Bros. canceled any plans for a sequel, instead opting to reboot the character in the DC Extended Universe line with the film Green Lantern Corps, set for release in 2020.  Question: will there be a green lantern 2 movie  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, it is unlikely that there will be a Green Lantern 2 movie. The passage states that Warner Bros. canceled plans for a sequel to the 2011 film, opting to reboot the character instead. This suggests that the studio has moved on from the 2011 film and does not plan to revisit the character with a new sequel. The passage specifically mentions the release of Green Lantern Corps, which implies that Warner Bros. is moving forward with a new direction for the character within the DC Extended Universe, rather than revisiting the original film.
1760518718	1760518719	Passage: United States and the International Criminal Court -- The United States should have the chance to observe and assess the functioning of the court, over time, before choosing to become subject to its jurisdiction. Given these concerns, I will not, and do not recommend that my successor, submit the treaty to the Senate for advice and consent until our fundamental concerns are satisfied.  Question: does the icc has jurisdiction in the united states  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, it does not explicitly state that the ICC has jurisdiction over the United States. However, it implies that the author has concerns about the ICC's jurisdiction over the US.  The author states that the US should have the chance to observe and assess the functioning of the court before becoming subject to its jurisdiction, suggesting that the author is concerned about the ICC's ability or willingness to exercise jurisdiction over the US. This implies that the author is questioning whether the ICC has the authority to prosecute the US for alleged crimes.  Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that the author is expressing skepticism about the ICC's jurisdiction over the US, but does not provide a clear answer to the question of whether the ICC does or does not have jurisdiction over the US.
1760518719	1760518720	Passage: Calcium carbide -- Calcium carbide is a chemical compound with the chemical formula of CaC. Its main use industrially is in the production of acetylene and calcium cyanamide.  Question: calcium carbide cac2 is the raw material for the production of acetylene  Explain your choice.	No, calcium carbide (CaC2) is not the raw material for the production of acetylene.  The correct process for producing acetylene involves the reaction of calcium carbide (CaC2) with water:  CaC2 + 2H2O → C2H2 + Ca(OH)2  In this reaction, calcium carbide reacts with water to produce acetylene (C2H2) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2).
1760518720	1760518720	Passage: Now You See Me (film series) -- Now You See Me is a series of heist thriller film written by Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin, and Edward Ricourt. They focus on the actions of a team of illusionists named ``The Four Horsemen'' who pull off near impossible heists. The series features an ensemble cast including Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Michael Caine, Lizzy Caplan, and Morgan Freeman. The first film was released in 2013, while the second was released in 2016, and a third film is currently in development and set to be released in 2019. The series has received mixed reviews from critics and audiences and grossed nearly $700 million worldwide.  Question: is there a now you see me 3 coming out  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, yes, there is a third installment in the Now You See Me film series, and it is currently in development. The passage states: "a third film is currently in development and set to be released in 2019."
1760518720	1760518721	Passage: Penalty shoot-out (association football) -- A shoot-out is usually considered for statistical purposes to be separate from the match which preceded it. In the case of a two-legged fixture, the two matches are still considered either as two draws or as one win and one loss; in the case of a single match, it is still considered as a draw. This contrasts with a fixture won in extra time, where the score at the end of normal time is superseded. Converted shoot-out penalties are not considered as goals scored by a player for the purposes of their individual records, or for ``golden boot'' competitions.  Question: does a penalty shoot out goal count towards the golden boot  Explain your choice.	No, a penalty shoot-out goal does not count towards the golden boot.  According to the passage, converted shoot-out penalties are not considered as goals scored by a player for the purposes of their individual records, or for "golden boot" competitions. This implies that goals scored in a penalty shoot-out are not counted when determining the winner of the golden boot award, which is typically given to the player who scores the most goals in a tournament.
1760518721	1760518722	Passage: Cutthroat Kitchen -- Cutthroat Kitchen is a cooking show hosted by Alton Brown that aired on the Food Network from August 11, 2013 to July 19, 2017. It features four chefs competing in a three-round elimination cooking competition. The contestants face auctions in which they can purchase opportunities to sabotage one another. Each chef is given $25,000 at the start of the show; the person left standing keeps whatever money they have not spent in the auctions. The show ended on its fifteenth season in July 2017. The series shares some basic elements with other four-chef, three-round elimination-style competitions on Food Network including Chopped and Guy's Grocery Games. Numerous Cutthroat Kitchen contestants have competed on these shows.  Question: will there be a new season of cutthroat kitchen  Explain your choice.	Based on the information provided, it seems unlikely that there will be a new season of Cutthroat Kitchen. The passage states that the show ended on its 15th season in July 2017, which suggests that it was a long-running show with a specific number of seasons. Additionally, the passage mentions that the show ended in 2017, which is over 5 years ago. It's unlikely that the show would be revived or rebooted after such a long time. However, it's also possible that the show may have a spin-off or a reunion special, but based on the information provided, it seems unlikely that there will be a new season of the original show.
1760518722	1760518722	Passage: Jack Sikma -- In 2006, Sikma was voted as one of the 100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament, a group of former players and coaches in honor of the 100 anniversary of the IHSA boys basketball tournament. On June 27, 2017, Sikma was inducted into the Small College Basketball Hall of Fame as part of their second class . Inducted alongside Sikma were Zelmo Beaty, Walt Frazier, Bob Love, Elmore Smith, Jim Spivey, Rico Swanson, George Tinsley, and Al Tucker.  Question: is jack sikma in the hall of fame  Explain your choice.	Yes, Jack Sikma is in the Hall of Fame.  The passage states that Jack Sikma was inducted into the Small College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2017.
1760518722	1760518724	Passage: Half-elven -- In J.R.R. Tolkien's fictional universe of Middle-earth, the Half-elven (Sindarin singular Peredhel, plural Peredhil, Quenya singular Perelda) are the children of the union of Elves and Men. Of these, the most significant were the products of couplings between the Eldar (the Elves who followed the Call to Valinor) and the Edain (the Men of the Three Houses of early Men who allied themselves with the Eldar in their war against Morgoth).  Question: can elves and humans mate lord of the rings  Explain your choice.	In J.R.R. Tolkien's fictional universe of Middle-earth, elves and humans can indeed mate, as indicated in the passage. The passage states that the Half-elven are the children of the union of Elves and Men.  In Tolkien's mythology, the Half-elven are the offspring of Elves and Men, which suggests that the two species are capable of interbreeding. This is also supported by the fact that the passage mentions the specific names for Half-elven in Quenya and Sindarin, indicating that they are a recognized and acknowledged part of the Tolkien's world.  Additionally, in Tolkien's lore, there are examples of Half-elven characters in his stories, such as Arwen and Aragorn, who are the children of Elves and Men. Aragorn, for instance, is a Half-elven human and the heir of Isildur, a human king, and his mother is Arwen, an Elf-maiden.  Therefore, based on Tolkien's mythology and the passage provided, it is clear that elves and humans can mate and produce Half-elven offspring in the Lord of the Rings universe.
1760518724	1760518725	Passage: The Boy in the Plastic Bubble -- The Boy in the Plastic Bubble is a 1976 American made-for-television drama film inspired by the lives of David Vetter and Ted DeVita, who lacked effective immune systems. It stars John Travolta, Glynnis O'Connor, Diana Hyland, Robert Reed, Ralph Bellamy & P.J. Soles. It was written by Douglas Day Stewart, executive produced by Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg (who, at the time, produced Starsky and Hutch and Charlie's Angels), and directed by Randal Kleiser, who would work with Travolta again in Grease shortly after. The original music score was composed by Mark Snow. The theme song ``What Would They Say'' was written and sung by Paul Williams. William Howard Taft High School in Woodland Hills was used for filming.  Question: the boy in the plastic bubble based on true story  Explain your choice.	The passage states that "The Boy in the Plastic Bubble" is "inspired by the lives of David Vetter and Ted DeVita, who lacked effective immune systems." This suggests that the film is based on a true story, but it's not a completely accurate depiction of the individuals' lives.   The passage does not explicitly state that the film is a completely true story, but rather that it was inspired by the real-life experiences of David Vetter and Ted DeVita. This implies that the film takes creative liberties to some extent, but it is rooted in fact. Therefore, the answer is that "The Boy in the Plastic Bubble" is based on a true story, but not entirely accurate.
1760518725	1760518728	Passage: A priori and a posteriori -- These terms are used with respect to reasoning (epistemology) to distinguish ``necessary conclusions from first premises'' (i.e., what must come before sense observation) from ``conclusions based on sense observation'' (which must follow it). Thus, the two kinds of knowledge, justification, or argument, may be glossed:  Question: science begins with the premise that knowledge should first be acquired through observation  Explain your choice.	The passage is using the terms "a priori" and "a posteriori" to describe the nature of knowledge acquisition in science.  The term "a priori" comes from the Latin words "ante" meaning "before" and "prior" meaning "before". In epistemology, "a priori" refers to knowledge or justification that is independent of sense experience or observation. It is knowledge that can be known through reason alone, without the need for empirical evidence or observation. In other words, a priori knowledge is knowledge that is derived from pure reasoning, deduction, or intuition.  On the other hand, the term "a posteriori" comes from the Latin words "post" meaning "after" and "prior" meaning "before". In epistemology, "a posteriori" refers to knowledge or justification that is derived from sense experience or observation. It is knowledge that is acquired through the use of the senses, such as sight, sound, touch, taste, or smell, and is often considered to be more reliable and certain than a priori knowledge.  In the context of the passage, the statement "science begins with the premise that knowledge should first be acquired through observation" suggests that science is based on a posteriori knowledge, which is knowledge that is derived from sense experience. This is because scientific knowledge is often acquired through observation of the natural world, experimentation, and data collection, rather than through pure reasoning or deduction alone.  Therefore, the passage is choosing "a posteriori" to describe the type of knowledge that is fundamental to scientific inquiry, implying that science relies on empirical evidence and observation to establish its knowledge claims.
1760518728	1760518728	Passage: Tim Brown (American football) -- Timothy Donell Brown (born July 22, 1966) is a former American football wide receiver who played professionally in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Notre Dame, where he won the Heisman Trophy, becoming the first wide receiver to win the award. He spent sixteen years with the Los Angeles/Oakland Raiders, during which he established himself as one of the NFL's most prolific wide receivers. Brown has also played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In 2015, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  Question: is tim brown in the hall of fame  Explain your choice.	Yes, Tim Brown is in the Hall of Fame.  According to the passage, Tim Brown was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2015. This indicates that he has been officially recognized as one of the greatest players in the history of American football, and is now a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
1760518728	1760518729	Passage: Drinking in public -- Drinking in public in Denmark is legal in general. The law forbids ``disturbing of the public law and order''. Thus general consumption is accepted. Several cafes have outdoor serving in the same zones.  Question: can you drink alcohol in public in denmark  Explain your choice.	Yes, you can drink alcohol in public in Denmark. According to the passage, the law in Denmark allows for the general consumption of alcohol in public, as long as it does not disturb the public law and order. This means that you can drink alcohol in public in Denmark, as long as you are not causing any disturbance or disrupting the peace.
1760518729	1760518729	Passage: Jersey pound -- Both Jersey and Bank of England notes are legal tender in Jersey and circulate together, alongside the Guernsey pound and Scottish banknotes. The Jersey notes are not legal tender in the United Kingdom but are legal currency, so creditors and traders may accept them if they so choose.  Question: is jersey currency legal tender in the uk  Explain your choice.	No, Jersey currency is not legal tender in the UK. According to the passage, Jersey notes are "not legal tender in the United Kingdom", meaning that they are not accepted as payment in all circumstances, unlike Bank of England notes which are.
1760518729	1760518730	Passage: Milwaukee Bucks -- The Bucks have won one league title (1971), two conference titles (1971 and 1974), and 13 division titles (1971--1974, 1976, 1980--1986, 2001). They have featured such notable players as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Sidney Moncrief, Oscar Robertson, Bob Dandridge, Bob Lanier, Glenn Robinson, Ray Allen, Sam Cassell, Junior Bridgeman, Michael Redd, Terry Cummings, Vin Baker, Jon McGlocklin, Marques Johnson, and Brian Winters.  Question: have the milwaukee bucks ever won a championship  Explain your choice.	Yes, the Milwaukee Bucks have won a championship. The passage states that they won one league title in 1971.
1760518730	1760518731	Passage: List of FIFA World Cup penalty shoot-outs -- This is a list of all penalty shoot-outs that have occurred in the Finals tournament of the FIFA World Cup. Penalty shoot-outs were introduced as tie-breakers in the 1978 World Cup but did not occur before 1982. The first time a World Cup title was won by penalty shoot-out was in 1994. The only other time was in 2006. By the end of the 2018 edition, 30 shoot-outs have taken place in the World Cup. Of these, only two reached the sudden death stage after still being tied at the end of ``best of five kicks''.  Question: does the world cup final go to penalties  Explain your choice.	No, the World Cup final does not always go to penalties.  Although the passage states that penalty shoot-outs have occurred in the World Cup finals and that there have been two instances where the title was won by penalty shoot-out (1994 and 2006), it does not imply that penalty shoot-outs are a regular outcome of World Cup finals. In fact, the passage mentions that penalty shoot-outs were introduced as tie-breakers in 1978 and that the first World Cup title was won by penalty shoot-out in 1994, suggesting that the majority of World Cup finals are decided through other means, such as regular time or extra time.
1760518731	1760518731	Passage: Kingdom (manga) -- Kingdom (キングダム, Kingudamu) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yasuhisa Hara (原泰久, Hara Yasuhisa). The manga provides a fictionalized account of the Warring States period primarily through the experiences of the war orphan Xin and his comrades as he fights to become the greatest general under the heavens, and in doing so, unifying China for the first time in history. The series was adapted into a thirty-eight episode anime series by studio Pierrot that aired from June 4, 2012 to February 25, 2013. A second season was announced and aired from June 8, 2013 to March 1, 2014. An English language release of the anime was licensed by Funimation.  Question: is kingdom manga based on a true story  Explain your choice.	No, the Kingdom manga is not based on a true story. The passage states that it provides a "fictionalized account" of the Warring States period in Chinese history, suggesting that the events and characters in the manga are not historical facts, but rather a creative interpretation and retelling of the period.
1760518731	1760518732	Passage: European Economic Area -- As of 2014 the contracting parties to the EEA are 3 of the 4 EFTA member states and 27 of the 28 EU member states. The 28th and newest EU member, Croatia, finished negotiating their accession to the EEA in November 2013, and since 12 April 2014 is provisionally applying the agreement pending its ratification by all EEA member states.  Question: is croatia part of the european economic area  Explain your choice.	Yes, Croatia is part of the European Economic Area (EEA).  According to the passage, Croatia finished negotiating its accession to the EEA in November 2013, and as of April 12, 2014, it is provisionally applying the agreement pending its ratification by all EEA member states. This means that Croatia has agreed to be part of the EEA and is currently in the process of being officially ratified, but it is already being treated as a member for practical purposes.
1760518732	1760518732	Passage: Posthumous marriage -- Posthumous marriage (or necrogamy) is a marriage in which one of the participating members is deceased. It is legal in France and similar forms are practiced in Sudan and China. Since World War I, France has had hundreds of requests each year, of which many have been accepted.  Question: can u marry a dead person in france  Explain your choice.	Yes, according to the passage, you can marry a dead person in France, but only if it is a posthumous marriage. This means that one of the participating members of the marriage is deceased.
1760518732	1760518733	Passage: Saline (medicine) -- Saline, also known as saline solution, is a mixture of sodium chloride in water and has a number of uses in medicine. Applied to the affected area it is used to clean wounds, help remove contact lenses, and help with dry eyes. By injection into a vein it is used to treat dehydration such as from gastroenteritis and diabetic ketoacidosis. It is also used to dilute other medications to be given by injection.  Question: is saline and sodium chloride the same thing  Explain your choice.	Yes, saline and sodium chloride are essentially the same thing.   The term "saline" is often used to refer to a solution of sodium chloride (common table salt) in water, and the two terms are often used interchangeably. In medical contexts, the term "saline" specifically refers to a solution of sodium chloride in water, which is often used for medical purposes.  In the passage, it mentions "a mixture of sodium chloride in water", which confirms that saline and sodium chloride are referring to the same substance.
1760518733	1760518734	Passage: Bubonic plague -- Several classes of antibiotics are effective in treating bubonic plague. These include aminoglycosides such as streptomycin and gentamicin, tetracyclines (especially doxycycline), and the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. Mortality associated with treated cases of bubonic plague is about 1--15%, compared to a mortality of 40--60% in untreated cases.  Question: is there a treatment for the bubonic plague  Explain your choice.	Yes, there are treatments for the bubonic plague. The passage states that several classes of antibiotics are effective in treating bubonic plague, including:  1. Aminoglycosides (e.g. streptomycin and gentamicin) 2. Tetracyclines (e.g. doxycycline) 3. Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin)  These antibiotics can help reduce the mortality associated with the plague, which is typically around 1-15% when treated. In contrast, untreated cases can have a mortality rate of 40-60%.
1760518734	1760518735	Passage: Joyce Summers -- The premise of the series is that Buffy is the latest Slayer, a young woman endowed by mystical forces with superhuman powers to fight and defeat vampires, demons, and other evil forces in the fictional town of Sunnydale. Like every Slayer before her, she was chosen and informed of her destiny when she was 15 years old. Her mother is unaware of her daughter's powers and responsibilities until Buffy is forced to tell her at the end of the second season of the television series. Although Joyce is shocked at this revelation, she recovers quickly and remains a source of stability for Buffy and Buffy's small circle of friends who assist her, dubbed the Scooby Gang. Eventually Joyce is able to take Buffy's dangerous demon-fighting in stride and even become proud and respectful of her daughter's abilities. Her natural death from an illness in the fifth season forces Buffy to face becoming an adult.  Question: does buffy's mom know she's a slayer  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, Joyce Summers does not initially know that her daughter Buffy is a Slayer. It is not until the end of the second season of the television series that Buffy is forced to tell her mother about her destiny and powers.
1760518735	1760518735	Passage: Leaning Tower of Pisa -- The tower's tilt began during construction in the 12th century, caused by an inadequate foundation on ground too soft on one side to properly support the structure's weight. The tilt increased in the decades before the structure was completed in the 14th century. It gradually increased until the structure was stabilized (and the tilt partially corrected) by efforts in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.  Question: was the leaning tower of pisa built leaning  Explain your choice.	No, the Leaning Tower of Pisa was not built leaning.  According to the passage, the tower's tilt began during construction in the 12th century, meaning it was built with a straight base, but over time, due to the soft ground, it developed a noticeable lean.
1760518735	1760518736	Passage: Fool's Gold (2008 film) -- Fool's Gold is a 2008 American adventure-romance film from Warner Bros. Pictures about a recently divorced couple who rekindle their romantic life while searching for a lost treasure. The film was directed by Andy Tennant and reunites the How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days stars Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson.  Question: is the movie fool's gold a true story  Explain your choice.	No, the movie "Fool's Gold" is not a true story. It is a work of fiction, a romantic adventure film that tells a fictional story about a recently divorced couple searching for a lost treasure. The movie is not based on real events or people, and its plot is not inspired by any historical or factual account. The story is created by the screenwriters and is not based on a true story.
1760518736	1760518737	Passage: Super Bowl curse -- The home field curse affects the host team of the Super Bowl. So far no team has yet managed to reach the Super Bowl in their home stadium. Four teams with Super Bowls in their home venue have qualified for the divisional playoffs: the 1994 Miami Dolphins, the 1998 Miami Dolphins, the 2016 Houston Texans, and the 2017 Minnesota Vikings, the Vikings being the first to qualify for their conference's title game. From 1966--2011 (excluding the six Super Bowl games held in a stadium without a professional team), the Super Bowl host team has had 11 winning seasons, four split seasons, and 25 losing seasons. Mathematically, the probability of that many losing seasons or more occurring by chance (assuming a 50 percent chance of having a losing season (disregarding .500 seasons)) is 7.69 percent. It should be noted, however, that the Super Bowl host stadium is selected several years before the game is played, without regard to the teams that qualify.  Question: has any nfl team played the superbowl at home  Explain your choice.	Yes, several NFL teams have played in the Super Bowl at home.  The passage mentions four teams that have qualified for the divisional playoffs but not won the Super Bowl in their home stadium: the 1994 Miami Dolphins, the 1998 Miami Dolphins, the 2016 Houston Texans, and the 2017 Minnesota Vikings.  However, there are also several teams that have won the Super Bowl in their home stadium. For example, the New England Patriots have won the Super Bowl six times at Gillette Stadium, and the Pittsburgh Steelers have won the Super Bowl six times at Heinz Field and Acrisure Stadium (previously known as Heinz Field).  So, to answer the question, yes, several NFL teams have played in the Super Bowl at home.
1760518737	1760518738	Passage: State constitution (Australia) -- In Australia, each state has its own constitution. Each state constitution preceded the Constitution of Australia as constitutions of the then separate British colonies, but all the states ceded powers to the Parliament of Australia as part of federation in 1901.  Question: does each australian state have its own constitution  Explain your choice.	Yes, each Australian state has its own constitution.  The passage states that each state in Australia has its own constitution, which preceded the Constitution of Australia as constitutions of the then separate British colonies. This implies that each state had its own pre-existing constitution before federation in 1901. Although the Australian Constitution was established as part of the federation, the individual states retained their own constitutions, which were later incorporated into the Australian Constitution.
1760518738	1760518740	Passage: Bundle branch block -- A bundle branch block can be diagnosed when the duration of the QRS complex on the ECG exceeds 120 ms. A right bundle branch block typically causes prolongation of the last part of the QRS complex, and may shift the heart's electrical axis slightly to the right. The ECG will show a terminal R wave in lead V1 and a slurred S wave in lead I. Left bundle branch block widens the entire QRS, and in most cases shifts the heart's electrical axis to the left. The ECG will show a QS or rS complex in lead V1 and a monophasic R wave in lead I. Another normal finding with bundle branch block is appropriate T wave discordance. In other words, the T wave will be deflected opposite the terminal deflection of the QRS complex. Bundle branch block, especially left bundle branch block, can lead to cardiac dyssynchrony. The simultaneous occurrence of left and right bundle branch block leads to total AV block.  Question: can you have a right and left bundle branch block  Explain your choice.	Yes, it is possible to have a simultaneous occurrence of right and left bundle branch block.  Bundle branch blocks occur when there is a blockage or disruption in one of the two main branches of the electrical conduction system of the heart. The two branches are:  1. Left bundle branch (LBB): Supplies the left ventricle. 2. Right bundle branch (RBB): Supplies the right ventricle.  A simultaneous occurrence of both LBB and RBB is known as "total AV block" or "complete heart block". This can lead to a significant impairment of the heart's ability to pump blood effectively, potentially resulting in heart failure, arrhythmias, and even death.  In some cases, the blockage can be partial, resulting in a simultaneous occurrence of both LBB and RBB, known as "bilateral bundle branch block". This can lead to cardiac dyssynchrony, where the electrical impulses are not coordinated properly, causing the heart to beat irregularly.  The ECG findings for bilateral bundle branch block typically include:  - A widened QRS complex (> 120 ms) - A QS or rS complex in lead V1 - A monophasic R wave in lead I - T wave discordance  In summary, a simultaneous occurrence of right and left bundle branch block is possible and can lead to a range of complications, including total AV block and cardiac dyssynchrony.
1760518740	1760518741	Passage: Check (chess) -- In informal games, it is customary to announce ``check'' when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check. In formal competitions, however, check is rarely announced.  Question: do you always have to say check in chess  Explain your choice.	No, you do not always have to say "check" in chess. In informal games, it is indeed customary to announce "check" when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check. However, in formal competitions, check is rarely announced.  This is because in formal competitions, such as tournaments and official matches, it is expected that players will make their moves in silence. Announcing "check" can sometimes be considered unnecessary or even distracting, as it can alert the opponent to the fact that they are in a precarious position.  In formal competitions, it is generally considered proper etiquette to make all moves silently, without announcing "check" or any other move. If a player wants to draw attention to the fact that they are putting their opponent's king in check, they can simply make the move and let the opponent observe the position.
1760518741	1760518744	Passage: Australian Cattle Dog -- The Texas Heeler is a cross between the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Shepherd that was first registered with the Animal Research Foundation (ARF) in 1970. The ARF has registered Australian Cattle Dogs without papers as ``Australian Cattledog Queensland Heelers'' since 1965 and was the first organisation to recognise the Australian Shepherd. Although originally bred for its ability to work cattle, the Texas Heeler is increasingly used as a pet and a companion in dog sports. As with most cross breeds, the Texas Heeler's size and appearance is a variable combination of the parent breeds.  Question: is an australian shepherd the same as an australian cattle dog  Explain your choice.	No, an Australian Shepherd and an Australian Cattle Dog are not the same. Although they share some similarities, they are two distinct breeds with different origins, characteristics, and histories.  Here are some key differences:  1. Origin: Australian Cattle Dogs were originally bred in Australia to work on cattle stations, while Australian Shepherds were bred in the United States to herd sheep and other livestock. 2. Size: Australian Cattle Dogs are generally larger and more muscular than Australian Shepherds. 3. Coat: Australian Cattle Dogs have a shorter, smoother coat that is often referred to as "blue" or "red", while Australian Shepherds have a medium-length coat that can be merle, blue merle, or red. 4. Temperament: Both breeds are intelligent and energetic, but Australian Cattle Dogs are often more independent and strong-willed, while Australian Shepherds are often more eager to please and responsive to training. 5. Registration: The Australian Shepherd was the first breed to be recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC), while the Australian Cattle Dog was not recognized until 1980.  In the passage, the Texas Heeler is a cross between an Australian Cattle Dog and an Australian Shepherd, which means it combines characteristics from both breeds.
1760518744	1760518745	Passage: Tomato purée -- Tomato purée is a thick liquid made by cooking and straining tomatoes. The difference between tomato paste, tomato purée, and tomato sauce is consistency; tomato puree has a thicker consistency and a deeper flavour than sauce.  Question: is tomato puree and tomato sauce the same thing  Explain your choice.	No, tomato purée and tomato sauce are not the same thing, despite both being made from tomatoes.  The main difference between the two is the consistency and texture. Tomato sauce is a thinner liquid, often used as a base for pasta sauces, soups, and stews. It has a more watery consistency, whereas tomato purée is thicker and more concentrated, with a deeper flavor.  While both can be made by cooking and straining tomatoes, the process of straining and cooking time can affect the final consistency and flavor of each. Tomato purée is often cooked for a longer period, which results in a more concentrated and intense flavor, whereas tomato sauce may be cooked for a shorter time and has a lighter consistency.  Additionally, the terminology can vary across different regions and cuisines, but in general, tomato purée is often used in European cuisine, particularly in French and Italian cooking, whereas tomato sauce is more commonly used in American and Mediterranean cuisine.
1760518745	1760518746	Passage: The Blues Brothers -- The Blues Brothers are an American blues and soul revivalist band which was founded in 1978 by comedy actors Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi as part of a musical sketch on Saturday Night Live. Belushi and Aykroyd fronted the band, respectively in character as lead vocalist ``Joliet'' Jake Blues and harmonica player/vocalist Elwood Blues. The band was composed of well-known and respected musicians, and debuted as the musical guest on the April 22, 1978, episode of Saturday Night Live, opening the show performing ``Hey Bartender'', and later ``Soul Man''.  Question: is the blues brothers based on a true story  Explain your choice.	No, the Blues Brothers are not based on a true story. The passage states that the band was founded by comedy actors Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi as part of a musical sketch on Saturday Night Live in 1978. The characters of Joliet Jake Blues and Elwood Blues are fictional, created for comedic purposes. The band's performances on Saturday Night Live were also scripted and not a representation of a real-life blues band.
1760518746	1760518747	Passage: Newcastle upon Tyne -- Newcastle upon Tyne (locally /njuːˈkæsəl/ ( listen)), commonly known as Newcastle, is a city in Tyne and Wear, North East England, 103 miles (166 km) south of Edinburgh and 277 miles (446 km) north of London on the northern bank of the River Tyne, 8.5 mi (13.7 km) from the North Sea. Newcastle is the most populous city in the North East, and forms the core of the Tyneside conurbation, the eighth most populous urban area in the United Kingdom. Newcastle is a member of the English Core Cities Group and is a member of the Eurocities network of European cities.  Question: is newcastle upon tyne the same as newcastle  Explain your choice.	Yes, Newcastle upon Tyne is the same as Newcastle.  The reason for this is that "upon Tyne" is a part of the city's official name. "Upon Tyne" refers to the city's location on the River Tyne. The full name "Newcastle upon Tyne" includes both the city's name and its geographical location. Therefore, "Newcastle" alone is not a complete or accurate name for the city.  In informal contexts, locals and visitors often shorten the name to simply "Newcastle", but technically, "Newcastle upon Tyne" is the more formal and official name of the city.
1760518747	1760518748	Passage: Post Office Ltd -- The Post Office provides information on services and accepts postal items and payment on behalf of the two collection and delivery divisions of Royal Mail Group, Royal Mail and Parcelforce. These include a variety of ordinary and guaranteed services both for delivery within the United Kingdom and to international destinations. Postage stamps (including commemorative stamps and other philatelic items) are sold, while applications for redirection of mail are accepted on behalf of Royal Mail.  Question: is post office and royal mail the same  Explain your choice.	No, Post Office Ltd and Royal Mail are not the same.  Although they are often mentioned together, they are two separate entities:  1. Royal Mail is the postal service provider, which operates in the United Kingdom. It is a public company and a leading postal service provider in the UK.  2. Post Office Ltd, on the other hand, is a separate company that provides a variety of financial services, including banking, bill payments, and other financial products. It is a subsidiary of the Royal Mail Group, which means it is owned by Royal Mail. However, Post Office Ltd operates independently and is not the same as Royal Mail.  In the passage, it is mentioned that Post Office Ltd accepts postal items and payment on behalf of Royal Mail, indicating that it is acting as an agent for Royal Mail, but they are distinct entities with different primary functions.
1760518748	1760518749	Passage: Unsuccessful nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States -- Justices are nominated by the president and then confirmed by the U.S. Senate. A nomination to the Court is considered to be official when the Senate receives a signed nomination letter from the president naming the nominee, which is then entered in the Senate's record. There have been 37 unsuccessful nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States. Of these, 11 nominees were rejected in Senate roll-call votes, 11 were withdrawn by the president, and 15 lapsed at the end of a session of Congress. Six of these unsuccessful nominees were subsequently nominated and confirmed to other seats on the Court. Additionally, although confirmed, seven nominees either declined office or (in one instance) died before assuming office.  Question: has any supreme court nominee not been confirmed  Explain your choice.	Yes, a Supreme Court nominee has not been confirmed.  The passage states that 37 nominations were unsuccessful, but it also mentions that 6 of these unsuccessful nominees were subsequently nominated and confirmed to other seats on the Court. This means that those 6 nominees were not confirmed to the Supreme Court but were still confirmed to other positions on the Court.  Additionally, 7 confirmed nominees declined office or died before assuming office, which also means they were not confirmed to the Supreme Court.  Therefore, the passage implies that there is at least one Supreme Court nominee who was not confirmed, but it does not provide specific information about that individual.
1760518749	1760518750	Passage: Thanksgiving (United States) -- Thanksgiving, or Thanksgiving Day, is a public holiday celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States. It originated as a harvest festival. Thanksgiving has been celebrated nationally on and off since 1789, after Congress requested a proclamation by George Washington. It has been celebrated as a federal holiday every year since 1863, when, during the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a national day of ``Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens,'' to be celebrated on the last Thursday in November. Together with Christmas and the New Year, Thanksgiving is a part of the broader fall/winter holiday season in the U.S.  Question: is thanksgiving always the last thursday of the month  Explain your choice.	No, Thanksgiving is not always the last Thursday of the month. According to the passage, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November, not the last Thursday.
1760518750	1760518750	Passage: The Lord of the Rings -- The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J.R.R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.  Question: is lord of the rings after the hobbit  Explain your choice.	Yes, "The Lord of the Rings" is after "The Hobbit" in the timeline of J.R.R. Tolkien's works.   According to the passage, "The Lord of the Rings" was written as a sequel to "The Hobbit", which was published in 1937. "The Lord of the Rings" was written between 1937 and 1949, indicating that it was published after "The Hobbit".
1760518750	1760518751	Passage: Fallen (2016 film) -- In December 2014, it was announced that Torment, the second installment in the Fallen book series, was in development. It is unknown whether the last two novels, Passion and Rapture, and the spin-off novel, Unforgiven, will be adapted as well. In 2017, producer Kevan Van Thompson asked the fans if they want an adaptation of ``Torment'', showing that the sequel still could be made.  Question: is the fallen movie going to have a sequel  Explain your choice.	No, the passage does not explicitly state that the Fallen movie is going to have a sequel. However, it does mention that the sequel, "Torment", is in development, and that a producer asked fans if they want an adaptation of "Torment", which suggests that the sequel may be possible.
1760518751	1760518752	Passage: List of most-followed Instagram accounts -- This list contains the top 50 accounts with the most followers on the social photo-sharing platform Instagram. As of October 2018, the most followed user is Instagram's own account, with over 260 million followers. Cristiano Ronaldo is the most followed individual, with over 144 million followers. Twelve accounts have exceeded 100 million followers on the site.  Question: does anyone on instagram have 1 billion followers  Explain your choice.	Based on the given information, it is unlikely that anyone on Instagram has 1 billion followers.  The passage states that as of October 2018, the most followed user on Instagram is the platform's own account, with over 260 million followers. Cristiano Ronaldo is the most followed individual, with over 144 million followers. This suggests that the majority of accounts on Instagram do not have a billion followers.  Additionally, the passage mentions that only 12 accounts have exceeded 100 million followers, which implies that the majority of accounts on Instagram have fewer than 100 million followers.  While it is possible that some accounts may have surpassed 1 billion followers since October 2018, there is no information in the passage to suggest that anyone on Instagram has achieved this milestone.
1760518752	1760518752	Passage: Padmé Amidala -- George Lucas, Rick McCallum, and casting director Robin Gurland auditioned over 200 actresses for the part of Padmé Amidala. They chose 16-year-old actress Natalie Portman to play the role. According to The Phantom Menace production notes, ``The role required a young woman who could be believable as the ruler of that planet, but at the same time be vulnerable and open.'' Portman's performances in The Professional (1994) and Beautiful Girls (1996) impressed Lucas. He stated, ``I was looking for someone who was young, strong, along the lines of Leia. Natalie embodied all those traits and more.''  Question: in the phantom menace is padme the queen  Explain your choice.	Yes, in "The Phantom Menace", Padmé Amidala is indeed the queen of the planet Naboo. She is the queen of Naboo at the beginning of the film and later becomes the senator of the Galactic Republic.
1760518752	1760518756	Passage: The Lord of the Rings -- The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J.R.R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.  Question: is lord of the rings considered an epic  Explain your choice.	Yes, The Lord of the Rings is considered an epic.

The scope of the story is epic in its breadth and depth. 2. **Heroic narrative**: The novel follows a heroic journey of Frodo Baggins, a humble hobbit who embarks on a perilous quest to destroy the One Ring, a powerful and ancient artifact that threatens the world. The narrative is driven by a clear hero's journey arc, with Frodo facing numerous challenges, trials, and setbacks as he navigates the treacherous landscape of Middle-earth. 3. **Mythological and symbolic themes**: The Lord of the Rings is infused with mythological and symbolic themes, drawing on Norse and Celtic mythologies, Christian allegory, and Tolkien's own love of linguistics and philology. This depth of thematic resonance adds to the epic nature of the story. 4. **Length and complexity**: The novel consists of three volumes: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King. Each book is a substantial work in its own right, with intricate plotting, character development, and world-building. The cumulative effect of these three volumes is an epic tale that requires significant time and effort to complete. 5. **Cultural impact**: The Lord of the Rings has had a profound impact on popular culture, inspiring countless adaptations, interpretations, and references in literature, film, and other art forms. Its influence extends beyond the realm of fantasy, with its themes and motifs resonating with readers worldwide.  Overall, The Lord of the Rings meets all the criteria that define an epic novel: it has a grand scope, a heroic narrative, mythological and symbolic themes, and a significant cultural impact.
1760518756	1760518756	Passage: Euro sign -- The euro sign (€) is the currency sign used for the euro, the official currency of the Eurozone in the European Union (EU). The design was presented to the public by the European Commission on 12 December 1996. The international three-letter code (according to ISO standard ISO 4217) for the euro is EUR. In Unicode it is encoded at U+20AC € euro sign (HTML &#8364; &euro; ). In English, the sign precedes the value (for instance, €10, not 10 €, unlike most other European languages). In some style guides, but not others, the euro sign is unspaced.  Question: does the euro sign go before the number  Explain your choice.	Yes, the euro sign goes before the number in English. The passage states: "In English, the sign precedes the value (for instance, €10, not 10 €)". This indicates that in English, the euro sign (€) is placed before the numerical value, rather than after it.
1760518756	1760518757	Passage: Induction cooking -- For nearly all models of induction cooktops, a cooking vessel must be made of, or contain, a ferrous metal such as cast iron or some stainless steels. The iron in the pot concentrates the current to produce heat in the metal. If the metal is too thin, or does not provide enough resistance to current flow, heating will not be effective. Most induction tops will not heat copper or aluminum vessels because the magnetic field cannot produce a concentrated current; ``all metal'' induction tops use much higher frequencies to overcome that effect. Any vessel can be used if placed on a suitable metal disk which functions as a conventional hotplate.  Question: can stainless steel be used on induction cooktop  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, yes, stainless steel can be used on an induction cooktop. It states that "For nearly all models of induction cooktops, a cooking vessel must be made of, or contain, a ferrous metal such as cast iron or some stainless steels." This implies that stainless steel is one of the acceptable materials that can be used on induction cooktops.
1760518757	1760518759	Passage: Dismissal (employment) -- ``Firing'' is a common colloquial term in the English language (particularly used in the U.S.) for termination. The term ``firing'' may have been initiated in the 1910s at the National Cash Register Company. Other terms for dismissal are being ``sacked'', ``canned'', ``let go'', ``ran-off'', ``axed'', ``given walking papers'', ``given the pink slip'' or ``boned''. Other terms, more often used in Commonwealth countries, include ``to get the boot'' and ``to get the sack''.  Question: is job termination the same as being fired  Explain your choice.	No, job termination and being fired are not exactly the same thing. While the terms are often used interchangeably, there can be subtle differences in connotation and nuance.  Job termination refers to the official process of ending an employee's employment relationship with an employer, usually due to performance issues, misconduct, or company restructuring. This can involve formal procedures, such as a meeting with HR or management, and may involve severance packages or other forms of compensation.  Being fired, on the other hand, typically implies a more abrupt or negative termination, often without adequate notice or severance. It can also imply that the employee was let go due to misconduct, poor performance, or other factors that are deemed unacceptable.  In the passage, the term "firing" is often used informally to refer to any termination, regardless of the circumstances. However, in more formal contexts, the distinction between job termination and being fired might be more pronounced.  In general, while both terms refer to the end of an employment relationship, the connotation and implications of each term can vary depending on the context and the specific circumstances of the termination.
1760518759	1760518761	Passage: Inattentional blindness -- In a 2015 study, Cary Stothart, Walter Boot, and Daniel Simons attempted to replicate and extend the findings from both Graham and Burke's 2011 study and Steven Most and colleague's 2000 study on Amazon Mechanical Turk using a sample of 515 participants that varied in age. In this study, participants were tasked with counting the number of times a number of white moving objects crossed the vertical midpoint of a display while ignoring a number of black moving objects. The unexpected object in this case was a gray cross that moved horizontally across the display at various distances from the vertical midpoint (this was manipulated between participants). Overall, they found that inattentional blindness susceptibility increases with age, which replicates the finding from Graham and Burke. In fact, they found that every 10 years of age was associated with a 1.3 fold increase in the probability of displaying inattentional blindness. They also found that the probability of inattentional blindness increases as the distance between the observer's focus of attention and the unexpected object increases, which replicates the finding from Most and colleagues. However, they also found that the relationship that age has with inattentional blindness does not change as a function of the unexpected object's distance from the focus of attention, suggesting that useful field of view does not mediate the relationship between age and inattentional blindness.  Question: does age have any influence on attentional ability or inattentional blindness  Explain your choice.	Yes, age has an influence on attentional ability and inattentional blindness. The study found that inattentional blindness susceptibility increases with age, specifically, every 10 years of age is associated with a 1.3 fold increase in the probability of displaying inattentional blindness. This suggests that as people get older, their ability to focus attention on a specific task may decline, making them more prone to inattentional blindness.  This is consistent with previous findings that age is a significant factor in attentional abilities, with older adults often experiencing declines in attentional abilities such as divided attention, attention switching, and attentional control. The study's finding also suggests that age-related declines in attentional abilities may contribute to the increased susceptibility to inattentional blindness.  Additionally, the study's results imply that the relationship between age and inattentional blindness is not mediated by the "useful field of view" (i.e., the range of vision that an individual can attend to simultaneously), suggesting that age-related declines in attentional abilities are not solely due to a reduction in the amount of visual information that can be processed, but rather a fundamental decline in the ability to focus attention.
1760518761	1760518762	Passage: Sanskrit -- Sanskrit belongs to the Indo-European family of languages. It is one of the three ancient documented languages that likely arose from a common root language now referred to as the Proto-Indo-European language:  Question: is sanskrit the first language of the world  Explain your choice.	No, Sanskrit is not the first language of the world. The passage states that Sanskrit is one of the three ancient documented languages that likely arose from a common root language, known as Proto-Indo-European. This implies that Sanskrit is a descendant of Proto-Indo-European, rather than the first language itself.  In fact, the origins of the first language of the world are still a topic of debate among linguists and scholars. While Sanskrit is considered one of the oldest Indo-European languages, it is not considered the first language of the world. The search for the first language, also known as the protolanguage, is still an active area of research and study in the fields of linguistics and archaeology.  It's worth noting that the concept of a single "first language" is complex and may be difficult to define. Many languages have evolved over time, and it's likely that there were many languages spoken before the emergence of Sanskrit and other Indo-European languages.
1760518762	1760518763	Passage: Jack Russell Terrier -- The Jack Russell Terrier is a small terrier that has its origins in fox hunting. It is principally white-bodied and smooth, rough or broken-coated but can be any colour.  Question: is a jack russell considered a small breed  Explain your choice.	Yes, a Jack Russell Terrier is generally considered a small breed.  Although the passage doesn't explicitly state the exact weight or height range of the breed, it is well-known that Jack Russell Terriers typically weigh between 13-17 pounds (6-7.7 kg) and stand about 10-15 inches (25-38 cm) tall at the shoulder. These measurements are characteristic of a small breed, which is consistent with the general classification of Jack Russell Terriers.
1760518763	1760518763	Passage: Air Force One -- The Air Force usually does not have fighter aircraft escort the presidential aircraft over the United States but it has occurred, for example during the attack on the World Trade Center.  Question: does air force one travel with fighter escort  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, the answer is "no" Air Force One does not usually travel with fighter escort over the United States. However, the passage does mention a specific instance where it occurred during the attack on the World Trade Center.
1760518763	1760518765	Passage: AR-15s in California -- The Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989 banned Colt AR-15 rifles by name in the State of California. California's 2000 Assault Weapons ban went further and banned AR-15s made by other manufacturers by name such as Bushmaster, PWA, and Olympic Arms.  Question: is it legal to own an ar15 in california  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, it appears that it is not entirely clear whether it is legal to own an AR-15 in California.   The Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989 banned Colt AR-15 rifles by name, but it does not explicitly mention other manufacturers. The 2000 Assault Weapons ban banned AR-15s made by specific manufacturers (Bushmaster, PWA, and Olympic Arms), but it does not mention other manufacturers.   Therefore, it can be inferred that AR-15s made by other manufacturers, such as Smith & Wesson, Ruger, or others, may still be allowed in California. However, the passage does not provide a clear answer, and it is unclear whether other AR-15 models are banned or allowed.
1760518765	1760518766	Passage: The Star-Spangled Banner -- ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' is the national anthem of the United States. The lyrics come from ``Defence of Fort M'Henry'', a poem written on September 14, 1814, by the then 35-year-old lawyer and amateur poet Francis Scott Key after witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry by British ships of the Royal Navy in Baltimore Harbor during the Battle of Baltimore in the War of 1812. Key was inspired by the large U.S. flag, with 15 stars and 15 stripes, known as the Star-Spangled Banner, flying triumphantly above the fort during the U.S. victory.  Question: is the national anthem and star spangled banner the same  Explain your choice.	Yes, the Star-Spangled Banner and the Star-Spangled Banner are the same. The term "Star-Spangled Banner" is actually an alternate name for the national anthem of the United States, which is also known as "The Star-Spangled Banner". The phrase "Star-Spangled Banner" is derived from the name of the poem that inspired the national anthem, "Defence of Fort M'Henry", and it refers to the flag with 15 stars and 15 stripes that was flying above Fort McHenry during the Battle of Baltimore.
1760518766	1760518766	Passage: Naples International Airport -- Naples International Airport (IATA: NAP, ICAO: LIRN) (Italian: Aeroporto Internazionale di Napoli) is the international airport serving Naples, Italy. It is located 3.2 NM (5.9 km; 3.7 mi) north-northeast of the city in the Capodichino district of Naples. The airport has two terminal buildings: Terminal 1 is for scheduled flights and Terminal 2, located away from the airfield, is used for charter operations.  Question: is there an international airport in naples italy  Explain your choice.	Yes, there is an international airport in Naples, Italy.   This is explicitly stated in the passage: "Naples International Airport (IATA: NAP, ICAO: LIRN) is the international airport serving Naples, Italy."
1760518766	1760518766	Passage: Cadbury Creme Egg -- Creme eggs are available annually between 1 January and Easter Day. In the UK in the 1980s, Cadbury made Creme Eggs available year-round but sales dropped and they returned to seasonal availability.  Question: can you buy cadburys creme eggs all year round  Explain your choice.	No, you cannot buy Cadbury Creme Eggs all year round. According to the passage, they are only available annually between January 1st and Easter Day in the UK.
1760518766	1760518767	Passage: Homologous chromosome -- A couple of homologous chromosomes, or homologs, are a set of one maternal and one paternal chromosome that pair up with each other inside a cell during meiosis. Homologs have the same genes in the same loci where they provide points along each chromosome which enable a pair of chromosomes to align correctly with each other before separating during meiosis. This is the basis for Mendelian inheritance which characterizes inheritance patterns of genetic material from an organism to its offspring parent developmental cell at the given time and area.  Question: do homologous chromosomes carry information for the same traits  Explain your choice.	Yes, homologous chromosomes carry information for the same traits.  The reason is that homologous chromosomes are pairs of chromosomes that originate from the same ancestral chromosome and have the same genes in the same loci. This means that they share the same genetic information, including the same genes, at the same locations on the chromosome.  When homologous chromosomes pair up during meiosis, they provide a matching set of genes that can be inherited together by the offspring. This is the basis for Mendelian inheritance, which describes how genetic traits are passed down from one generation to the next.  In other words, homologous chromosomes are like "sister chromosomes" that carry identical genetic information, allowing for the transmission of traits from one generation to the next.
1760518767	1760518768	Passage: Michigan Wolverines football -- Michigan began competing in intercollegiate football in 1879. The Wolverines joined the Big Ten Conference at its inception in 1896, and other than a hiatus from 1907 to 1916, have been members since. Michigan has won or shared 42 league titles, and, since the inception of the AP Poll in 1936, has finished in the top 10 a total of 38 times. The Wolverines claim 11 national championships, most recently that of the 1997 squad voted atop the final AP Poll.  Question: has michigan ever won a national championship in football  Explain your choice.	Yes, Michigan has won a national championship in football. The passage states that the Wolverines claim 11 national championships, with the most recent one being in 1997, when they were voted atop the final AP Poll.
1760518768	1760518770	Passage: Waiter Rule -- The Waiter Rule refers to a common belief that one's true character can be gleaned from how one treats staff or service workers, such as a ``waiter''. The rule was one of William H Swanson's 33 Unwritten Rules of Management, copied from Dave Barry's version ``If someone is nice to you but rude to the waiter, they are not a nice person.''  Question: you can tell a lot about a person by how they treat their waiter  Explain your choice.	I don't agree with the statement "you can tell a lot about a person by how they treat their waiter." Here's why:  1. Limited scope: The statement implies that the way a person treats their waiter is a comprehensive indicator of their character. However, this is a narrow and subjective assessment. People can exhibit good behavior towards waiters in certain situations, but still have other flaws or imperfections in other areas of their life.  2. Contextual factors: The way a person treats their waiter can be influenced by various contextual factors, such as the person's mood, stress levels, or the specific circumstances of the situation. A person might be having a bad day or be under pressure, leading them to be short-tempered with their waiter.  3. Lack of empathy: The statement doesn't account for situations where a person is having a good day, is in a good mood, and is genuinely kind and respectful towards their waiter. It also doesn't consider that waiters may be having a bad day or are underpaid and overworked.  4. Overemphasis on service workers: The statement focuses primarily on waiters, which doesn't account for how people treat other service workers, such as retail employees, customer service representatives, or colleagues.  5. Oversimplification: The statement oversimplifies the complexity of human behavior and character. People are multifaceted, and their behavior towards waiters is just one aspect of their overall personality.  In conclusion, while treating waiters with kindness and respect is a desirable trait, it's not a definitive indicator of a person's character.
1760518770	1760518772	Passage: American crocodile -- Within the United States, the American crocodile's distribution is limited to the southern tip of Florida, though at least two have been found as far north as the Tampa Bay area. The current US population, estimated at 2,000, represents a significant recovery from a few hundred in the 1970s.  Question: are there any crocodiles native to north america  Explain your choice.	Yes, there are two species of crocodiles that are native to North America: the American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) and the Morelet's crocodile (Crocodylus moreletii). However, the American crocodile is the only one found in the wild in the United States.  The American crocodile is native to the southeastern coastal regions of the United States, specifically the southern tip of Florida, and parts of Central and South America. It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List and is protected by law in the United States.  Morelet's crocodile, on the other hand, is native to Central America, primarily in Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.
1760518772	1760518772	Passage: Lex Luthor (Smallville) -- Season seven displayed Lex's descent into darkness; he has a brother-like relationship with Grant Gabriel (Michael Cassidy), the new editor of the Daily Planet newest editor, until it's revealed Grant is actually a clone of Lex's late brother. After Lex buys the Daily Planet, Grant attempts to keep Lex from being controlling, thus Lex has his brother's clone murdered and staged as a failed mugging. Lex then discovers that the previous symbols are connected to the secret organization Veritas, which his father is a part of. The Veritas members learned that an alien visitor known as ``The Traveler'' would arrive in Smallville during the meteor shower of 1989. At this time, Lex realizes that Lionel has been covering up the Traveler's existence and subsequently kills his own father for it. He eventually discovers that the Veritas members knew of a means to control the Traveler, so Lex sets out to find the device. The device, an orb he finds in the mantle above a fireplace in the Luthor mansion, leads Lex to the Fortress of Solitude, where he is confronted by Clark. Having finally discovered Clark's secret, Lex uses the orb to bring down the Fortress around Clark and himself.  Question: does lex luthor know who superman is in smallville  Explain your choice.	Yes, Lex Luthor in Smallville does know who Superman is.  This can be inferred from the passage, where it is stated that Lex discovers the existence of "The Traveler", which is revealed to be an alien visitor known as Superman. Additionally, Lex eventually discovers that the Traveler is actually Clark Kent, who is Superman.
1760518772	1760518773	Passage: Admission to the bar in the United States -- In the canonical case, lawyers seeking admission must earn a Juris Doctor degree from a law school approved by the jurisdiction, and then pass a bar exam administered by it. Typically, there is also a character and fitness evaluation, which includes a background check. However, there are exceptions to each of these requirements. A lawyer who is admitted in one state is not automatically allowed to practice in any other. Some states have reciprocal agreements that allow attorneys from other states to practice without sitting for another full bar exam; such agreements differ significantly among the states.  Question: do you have to have a college degree to take the bar exam  Explain your choice.	No, you do not necessarily have to have a college degree to take the bar exam. While many law students do have a bachelor's degree, it is not a requirement for taking the bar exam in the United States.  The passage states that "lawyers seeking admission must earn a Juris Doctor degree from a law school approved by the jurisdiction." This means that a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree is the minimum educational requirement for taking the bar exam, not a college degree in any other field.
1760518773	1760518774	Passage: Iron Fist (season 2) -- The second season of the American web television series Iron Fist, which is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, follows Danny Rand / Iron Fist, a martial arts expert with the ability to call upon the power of the Iron Fist. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films and other television series of the franchise. The season is produced by Marvel Television in association with ABC Studios, with Raven Metzner serving as showrunner.  Question: will there be a season 2 of marvel's iron fist  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, there is no confirmation that a second season of Marvel's Iron Fist has been officially announced or produced. The passage only mentions that it is the "second season of the American web television series Iron Fist", implying that the first season has already been completed. However, it does not provide information about a second season being in production or confirmed to exist.
1760518774	1760518774	Passage: Toll-free telephone numbers in the North American Numbering Plan -- In the United States of America, Canada, and other countries participating in the North American Numbering Plan, a toll-free telephone number has one of the area codes 800, 833, 844, 855, 866, 877, and 888.  Question: is 844 a toll free number in canada  Explain your choice.	Based on the given information, it is not explicitly stated that 844 is a toll-free number in Canada. The passage only mentions that it is a toll-free number in the United States of America. Therefore, I would not be able to confirm whether 844 is a toll-free number in Canada.
1760518774	1760518776	Passage: Daylight saving time by country -- Most areas in North America and Europe, and some areas in the Middle East, observe daylight saving time (DST), while most areas of Africa and Asia do not. In South America, most countries in the north of the continent near the equator do not observe DST, while Paraguay and southern parts of Brazil do. The practice of observing daylight saving time in Oceania is also mixed, with New Zealand and parts of southeastern Australia observing DST, while most other areas do not.  Question: does any other country have daylight savings time  Explain your choice.	Yes, many countries around the world observe daylight saving time (DST) in addition to the ones mentioned in the passage. Here are some examples:  1. Australia (except for Western Australia and the Northern Territory, which do not observe DST) 2. Brazil (except for the southernmost states, which do observe DST) 3. China (some provinces and cities observe DST, but not the entire country) 4. India (some states and cities observe DST, but not the entire country) 5. Japan (some prefectures observe DST, but not the entire country) 6. Russia (most regions observe DST, except for some in the west and northwest) 7. South Africa (most provinces observe DST, except for the northern parts near the equator) 8. Turkey (most of the country observes DST, but the eastern part does not) 9. United States (most states observe DST, except for Hawaii and most of Arizona) 10. Canada (most provinces and territories observe DST, except for some in the west and northwest)  It's worth noting that some countries near the equator, like Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, and Malaysia, do not observe DST, as the daylight hours remain relatively consistent throughout the year.  Additionally, some countries have different start and end dates for DST, or have a "half-hour deviation" (e.g., moving the clock forward by 30 minutes instead of 1 hour).
1760518776	1760518777	Passage: Johnny Vander Meer -- John Samuel Vander Meer (November 2, 1914 -- October 6, 1997) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a pitcher, most notably for the Cincinnati Reds. Vander Meer is best known for being the only pitcher in Major League Baseball history to throw two consecutive no-hitters. After the impressive start to his major league career, he experienced problems controlling the accuracy of his pitching, and his later career was marked by inconsistent performances.  Question: has anyone ever pitched back to back no hitters  Explain your choice.	Yes, anyone has pitched back-to-back no-hitters.   John Samuel Vander Meer achieved this feat in 1938 while pitching for the Cincinnati Reds.
1760518777	1760518777	Passage: Black Bike Week -- Black Bike Week, also called Atlantic Beach Bikefest and Black Bikers Week, is an annual motorcycle rally in the Myrtle Beach, South Carolina area, held on Memorial Day weekend. It is also sometimes called Black Fill-in-the-Blank Week, because it has evolved to attract many non-motorcycling visitors who come for music, socializing and enjoying the beach. Events include motorcycle racing, concerts, parties, and street festivals. Called a ``one-of-a-kind event'' and ``an exhibitionist's paradise'' by Jeffrey Gettleman, Black Bike Week is ``all about riding, styling and profiling,'' in the words of Mayor Irene Armstrong of Atlantic Beach, South Carolina.  Question: is there a black bike week in myrtle beach  Explain your choice.	Yes, there is a Black Bike Week in Myrtle Beach. According to the passage, it is officially called Black Bike Week, but it is also sometimes referred to as Atlantic Beach Bikefest and Black Bikers Week. This suggests that it is indeed held in the Myrtle Beach area.
1760518777	1760518778	Passage: Static (DC Comics) -- It was recently revealed that prior to his abduction, Static teamed with Justice League member Black Lightning in order to stop former Blood Syndicate member Holocaust, who had tried to kill the superhero while he was acting as the keynote speaker at Ernest Hemingway High's senior graduation.  Question: are static shock and black lightning the same person  Explain your choice.	No, Static Shock and Black Lightning are not the same person.  Static Shock, whose secret identity is Virgil Hawkins, is a superhero in the DC Comics universe. He gained his powers after being exposed to a gas that altered his DNA, allowing him to control and manipulate electricity.  Black Lightning, on the other hand, is the superhero alter ego of Jefferson Pierce, a high school principal who gained the ability to control and manipulate electricity after being shot with a bullet that was imbued with a lightning bolt. He is a member of the Justice League.  In the passage provided, it is stated that Static teamed up with Black Lightning to stop Holocaust, a former Blood Syndicate member, which suggests that they were allies in this particular situation. This implies that they are different characters, despite both having the ability to control electricity.
1760518778	1760518782	Passage: Unbreakable glass -- Unbreakable glass is glass, or glass substitute, which does not display the normal fragility of glass - in general the term is not used to refer to something that is absolutely unbreakable.  Question: is there such a thing as unbreakable glass  Explain your choice.	While there is no such thing as "unbreakable" glass in the sense of a glass that is completely impervious to breakage, there are materials that exhibit exceptional resistance to breakage or shattering. These materials are often referred to as "unbreakable" or "impact-resistant" glass.  There are several types of glass that have been developed with enhanced strength and durability, making them more resistant to breakage:  1. **Laminated glass**: This type of glass is made by sandwiching a layer of plastic between two panes of glass. If the glass breaks, the plastic layer helps to hold the pieces together, making it difficult for them to shatter into sharp fragments. 2. **Tempered glass**: Also known as toughened glass, this type of glass is heat-treated to increase its strength and resistance to thermal stress. When tempered glass breaks, it shatters into small, blunt pieces rather than sharp shards. 3. **Acrylic glass**: Also known as plexiglass or acrylic, this type of glass is made from a type of plastic that is more impact-resistant than traditional glass. It is often used in applications where breakage is a concern, such as in safety glass for cars or in displays. 4. **Fiberglass**: Fiberglass is a composite material made from glass fibers embedded in a polymer matrix. It is stronger and more resistant to breakage than traditional glass. 5. **Smart glass**: This type of glass can change its transparency and reflectivity in response to external stimuli, such as light or temperature changes. Some smart glass materials have been developed with enhanced strength and durability, making them more resistant to breakage.  While these materials are not completely "unbreakable," they are designed to be more resistant to breakage than traditional glass. However, it's essential to note that no material is completely unbreakable, and there is always a risk of damage or shattering, even with these advanced materials.
1760518782	1760518782	Passage: Liquid latex -- As the latex dries it becomes very sticky and will stick to itself if accidentally folded over. Most manufacturers offer a slick spray for latex once it is dry to take away the stickiness allowing the movement of the model's limbs. Alternatively, shimmer powders can be dusted over dried liquid latex to create metallic effects. One advantage to the tackiness of liquid latex is that it can act as an adhesive to attach things to the paint, such as zippers.  Question: can liquid latex be used as an adhesive  Explain your choice.	Yes, liquid latex can be used as an adhesive. According to the passage, it states that "the tackiness of liquid latex can act as an adhesive to attach things to the paint, such as zippers." This implies that liquid latex has adhesive properties that can be utilized to bond objects to a surface, specifically in this case, to attach zippers to paint.
1760518782	1760518784	Passage: Gun laws in Texas -- Gov. Perry also signed H.B. 1815 after passage by the 2007 Legislature, a bill that allows any Texas resident to carry a handgun in the resident's motor vehicle without a CHL or other permit. The bill revised Chapter 46, Section 2 of the Penal Code to state that it is in fact not ``Unlawful Carry of a Weapon'', as defined by the statute, for a person to carry a handgun while in a motor vehicle they own or control, or to carry while heading directly from the person's home to that car. However, lawful carry while in a vehicle requires these four critical qualifiers: (1) the weapon must not be in plain sight (in Texas law, ``plain sight'' and ``concealed'' are mutually exclusive opposing terms); (2) the carrier cannot be involved in criminal activities, other than Class C traffic misdemeanors; (3) the carrier cannot be prohibited by state or federal law from possessing a firearm; and (4) the carrier cannot be a member of a criminal gang.  Question: is it illegal to carry a pistol in your car in texas  Explain your choice.	No, it is not entirely illegal to carry a pistol in your car in Texas. According to the passage, a Texas resident can carry a handgun in their motor vehicle without a CHL (Concealed Handgun License) or permit, as long as they meet four critical qualifiers:  1. The weapon is not in plain sight. 2. The carrier is not involved in criminal activities (except for Class C traffic misdemeanors). 3. The carrier is not prohibited by state or federal law from possessing a firearm. 4. The carrier is not a member of a criminal gang.  However, there is a caveat: the passage states that carrying a handgun while heading directly from the person's home to their car is not allowed. This implies that carrying a handgun in a car is allowed while the gun is not being used to commit a crime, but carrying it while driving directly to the car from home is not permitted.  So, to summarize, it is generally not illegal to carry a pistol in your car in Texas, but there are specific conditions and limitations that apply.
1760518784	1760518785	Passage: Sgian-dubh -- When worn as part of the national dress of Scotland, the sgian-dubh is legal in Scotland, England and Wales. In Scotland under the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 Sec. 49, Sub-sec. 5(c); in England and Wales, under the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (section 139) and the Offensive Weapons Act 1996 (section 4).  Question: is it legal to carry a sgian dubh  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, yes, it is legal to carry a sgian-dubh in Scotland, England, and Wales. The specific laws regarding the sgian-dubh are as follows:  - In Scotland: Under the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995, Sec. 49, Sub-sec. 5(c) - In England and Wales:    1. Under the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (section 139)   2. Under the Offensive Weapons Act 1996 (section 4)  This indicates that the sgian-dubh is permitted in all three countries, making it legal to carry one in Scotland, England, and Wales.
1760518785	1760518786	Passage: Hypoglossal nerve -- The hypoglossal nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve, and innervates all the extrinsic and intrinsic muscles of the tongue, except for the palatoglossus which is innervated by the vagus nerve. It is a nerve with a solely motor function. The nerve arises from the hypoglossal nucleus in the brain stem as a number of small rootlets, passes through the hypoglossal canal and down through the neck, and eventually passes up again over the tongue muscles it supplies into the tongue. There are two hypoglossal nerves in the body: one on the left, and one on the right.  Question: several cranial nerves innervate structures of the tongue  Explain your choice.	The passage states that the hypoglossal nerve is the 12th cranial nerve, which is correct. However, it also mentions that the palatoglossus muscle is innervated by the vagus nerve, which is the 9th cranial nerve. This suggests that at least two cranial nerves innervate structures of the tongue: the hypoglossal nerve (12th cranial nerve) and the vagus nerve (9th cranial nerve).
1760518786	1760518787	Passage: Puerto Rico -- Puerto Rico (Spanish for ``Rich Port''), officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (Spanish: Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, lit. ``Free Associated State of Puerto Rico'') and briefly called Porto Rico, is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea.  Question: is porto rico a part of the united states  Explain your choice.	Yes, Porto Rico is a part of the United States.  Although it is officially known as the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, it is not a state, but rather an unincorporated territory of the United States. This means that it is subject to the authority of the US Congress, but it is not part of any state and does not have the same rights and powers as states.
