1760579196	1760579197	Passage: Persian language -- Persian (/ˈpɜːrʒən, -ʃən/), also known by its endonym Farsi (فارسی fārsi (fɒːɾˈsiː) ( listen)), is one of the Western Iranian languages within the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family. It is primarily spoken in Iran, Afghanistan (officially known as Dari since 1958), and Tajikistan (officially known as Tajiki since the Soviet era), and some other regions which historically were Persianate societies and considered part of Greater Iran. It is written in the Persian alphabet, a modified variant of the Arabic script, which itself evolved from the Aramaic alphabet.  Question: do iran and afghanistan speak the same language  Explain your choice.	No, Iran and Afghanistan do not speak the same language. Although they share a common historical and cultural heritage, the languages spoken in the two countries are different.  Iran is primarily inhabited by people who speak Persian (also known as Farsi), which is a Western Iranian language within the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family.  Afghanistan, on the other hand, is officially known as Dari since 1958, which is a dialect of Persian that is spoken in Afghanistan. However, it is distinct from the Persian spoken in Iran. Dari is a separate language with its own grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation, although it is mutually intelligible with Persian.  In other words, while Iran and Afghanistan share a common cultural and linguistic heritage, they have distinct languages that are not identical.	164	1.0
1760579197	1760579199	Passage: Good Samaritan law -- Good Samaritan laws offer legal protection to people who give reasonable assistance to those who are, or who they believe to be, injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. The protection is intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, for fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. An example of such a law in common-law areas of Canada: a good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing. Its purpose is to keep people from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in treatment. By contrast, a duty to rescue law requires people to offer assistance and holds those who fail to do so liable.  Question: do good samaritan laws protect those who help at an accident  Explain your choice.	"Yes, good Samaritan laws protect those who help at an accident. According to the passage, the purpose of these laws is to ""reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist"" in situations where someone is injured or in distress. This suggests that the laws aim to encourage people to help, even if they might make a mistake, without fear of being sued or prosecuted.  In general, good Samaritan laws provide liability protection to individuals who provide reasonable assistance to someone who is injured, ill, or in peril. This means that if someone helps someone in an accident and inadvertently causes further injury or harm, they may not be held liable for the consequences.  For example, if someone stops to help a person who is injured in a car accident and, in the process, accidentally causes further injury to the injured person, a good Samaritan law may protect them from being sued for negligence.  However, it's worth noting that these laws do not provide blanket protection for all actions taken in good faith to help someone in distress. The level of protection varies by jurisdiction, and there may be specific requirements or limitations to the laws."	226	1.0
1760579199	1760579200	Passage: Windows Movie Maker -- Windows Movie Maker (formerly known as Windows Live Movie Maker in Windows 7) is a discontinued video editing software by Microsoft. It is a part of Windows Essentials software suite and offers the ability to create and edit videos as well as to publish them on OneDrive, Facebook, Vimeo, YouTube, and Flickr.  Question: is windows movie maker part of windows essentials  Explain your choice.	Yes, Windows Movie Maker is part of the Windows Essentials software suite. This was the case in Windows 7 and earlier versions. However, in 2012, Microsoft discontinued Windows Movie Maker and replaced it with Windows Photo Gallery, a more streamlined and modern photo and video management tool.  Although Windows Movie Maker is no longer part of the official Windows Essentials suite, it can still be downloaded from the Internet Archive, a digital library that preserves and makes available software, games, and other digital content that is no longer commercially available.  In 2020, Microsoft released a free alternative called Shotcut, which is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, and offers many of the same features as Windows Movie Maker.	145	0.6
1760579200	1760579202	Passage: Powdered sugar -- Powdered sugar, also called confectioners' sugar, icing sugar, and icing cake, is a finely ground sugar produced by milling granulated sugar into a powdered state. It usually contains a small amount of anti-caking agent to prevent clumping and improve flow. Although most often produced in a factory, powdered sugar can also be made by processing ordinary granulated sugar in a coffee grinder, or by crushing it by hand in a mortar and pestle.  Question: is confectionary sugar the same as powdered sugar  Explain your choice.	No, confectioner's sugar and powdered sugar are not exactly the same, although they are often used interchangeably.  The key difference lies in the addition of anti-caking agents. Confectioner's sugar typically refers to powdered sugar that contains a specific type of anti-casting agent, usually cornstarch or tapioca flour, which helps prevent the sugar from clumping and improves its flow. This type of powdered sugar is often used for making confections, candies, and frostings.  Powdered sugar, on the other hand, is a more general term that simply refers to sugar that has been ground into a fine powder. It may or may not contain anti-caking agents. Powdered sugar can be used for various purposes, including decorating cakes, making frostings, and dusting desserts.  In summary, while both confectioner's sugar and powdered sugar are fine powders, confectioner's sugar is a specific type of powdered sugar that contains anti-caking agents, whereas powdered sugar is a more general term that may or may not include these agents.	219	
1760579202	1760579205	Passage: The Elder Scrolls Online -- As with other games in The Elder Scrolls series, the game is set on the continent of Tamriel. The events of the game occur a millennium before those of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and around 800 years before The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. It has a broadly similar structure to Skyrim, with two separate conflicts progressing at the same time, one with the fate of the world in the balance, and one where the prize is supreme power on Tamriel. In The Elder Scrolls Online, the first struggle is against the Daedric Prince Molag Bal, who is attempting to meld the plane of Mundus with his realm of Coldharbour, and the second is to capture the vacant imperial throne, contested by three alliances of the mortal races. The player character has been sacrificed to Molag Bal, and Molag Bal has stolen their soul, the recovery of which is the primary game objective.  Question: is elder scrolls online the same as skyrim  Explain your choice.	"No, The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) is not the same as Skyrim. While both games share the same universe and some similar elements, they have distinct differences in their settings, storylines, and gameplay mechanics.  Here are some key differences:  1. **Setting**: As the passage mentions, ESO takes place in Tamriel, but around 800 years before Skyrim, which means the game has a different time period and setting. 2. **Storyline**: The primary conflict in ESO revolves around Molag Bal's attempt to merge the plane of Mundus with his realm of Coldharbour, and the player's goal is to recover their stolen soul. In contrast, Skyrim's main storyline is centered around the Civil War between the Imperial Legion and the Stormcloaks, with the fate of the world in balance. 3. **Gameplay mechanics**: Although ESO has a similar structure to Skyrim, the gameplay mechanics and systems are not identical. ESO has its own unique features, such as the ""One Tamriel"" design, which allows players to explore the entire continent of Tamriel, and a more action-oriented combat system. 4. **Tone and atmosphere**: The tone and atmosphere of ESO are also different from Skyrim. ESO has a darker and more mystical tone, while Skyrim is more focused on medieval fantasy and action-adventure elements.  In summary, while The Elder Scrolls Online shares some similarities with Skyrim, it is a distinct game with its own unique storyline, gameplay mechanics, and setting."	314	
1760579205	1760579205	Passage: Epsom railway station -- Epsom railway station serves the town of Epsom in Surrey. It is located off Waterloo Road and is less than two minutes' walk from the High Street. It is not in the London Oyster card zone unlike Epsom Downs or Tattenham Corner stations. The station building was replaced in 2012/2013 with a new building with apartments above the station (see end of article).  Question: can you use oyster card at epsom station  Explain your choice.	"No, you cannot use an Oyster card at Epsom station. The passage states that Epsom station is ""not in the London Oyster card zone"", which implies that it is outside of the area covered by the Oyster card system."	52	
1760579205	1760579206	Passage: Da Vinci's Demons -- The series premiered in the United States on Starz on 12 April 2013, and its second season premiered on 22 March 2014. The series was renewed for a third season, which premiered on 24 October 2015. On 23 July 2015, Starz announced that the third season would be the show's last. However Goyer has left it open for a miniseries return.  Question: will there be a season 4 of da vinci's demons  Explain your choice.	Based on the information provided, it is not explicitly stated that there will be a season 4 of Da Vinci's Demons. In fact, it is mentioned that the third season premiered on 24 October 2015 and was announced as the show's last season, with the creator leaving the door open for a potential miniseries return. However, this does not guarantee a full season 4.	82	
1760579206	1760579207	Passage: Federal judiciary of the United States -- The federal courts are composed of three levels of courts. The Supreme Court of the United States is the court of last resort. It is generally an appellate court that operates under discretionary review, which means that the Court can choose which cases to hear, by granting writs of certiorari. There is therefore generally no basic right of appeal that extends automatically all the way to the Supreme Court. In a few situations (like lawsuits between state governments or some cases between the federal government and a state) it sits as a court of original jurisdiction.  Question: is the federal court the same as the supreme court  Explain your choice.	No, the federal court is not the same as the Supreme Court.  According to the passage, the federal court is composed of three levels of courts, with the Supreme Court being the court of last resort. The federal court is described as an appellate court that operates under discretionary review, meaning it can choose which cases to hear.  On the other hand, the Supreme Court is specifically mentioned as the court of last resort, which implies that it is the highest court in the federal judiciary system. It is the court that has the final say in interpreting federal laws and the Constitution.  In other words, the federal court is a more general term that encompasses multiple levels of courts, while the Supreme Court is a specific court that is the highest level of the federal judiciary.	155	
1760579207	1760579208	Passage: Bixby letter -- In the 1998 war film Saving Private Ryan, General George Marshall (played by Harve Presnell) reads the Bixby letter to his officers before giving the order to find and send home Private James Francis Ryan after Ryan's three brothers died in battle.  Question: did abraham lincoln write the letter in saving private ryan  Explain your choice.	No, Abraham Lincoln did not write the letter in the movie Saving Private Ryan. The passage mentions that General George Marshall (played by Harve Presnell) reads the Bixby letter to his officers before giving the order to find and send home Private James Francis Ryan.  The Bixby letter is actually a real historical letter, and it was written by Captain Herbert Bixby, a commander of the 307th Infantry Regiment, 76th Infantry Division, during World War II. The letter was written to the US Army's Quartermaster General, George C. Marshall, in 1942, requesting permission to send a team to rescue a paratrooper who was the last surviving brother of four servicemen from the same family, as they had lost three brothers in battle.  In the movie Saving Private Ryan, the scene where General Marshall reads the Bixby letter is a dramatization of this real-life event.	190	
1760579208	1760579209	Passage: Batman & Robin (film) -- With the box office success of Batman Forever in June 1995, Warner Bros. immediately commissioned a sequel. They hired director Joel Schumacher and writer Akiva Goldsman to reprise their duties the following August, and decided it was best to fast track production for a June 1997 target release date, which is a break from the usual 3-year gap between films. Schumacher wanted to homage both the broad camp style of the 1960s television series and the work of Dick Sprang. The storyline of Batman & Robin was conceived by Schumacher and Goldsman during pre-production on A Time to Kill. Portions of Mr. Freeze's back-story were based on the Batman: The Animated Series episode ``Heart of Ice'', written by Paul Dini.  Question: is batman and robin a sequel to batman forever  Explain your choice.	No, Batman & Robin is not a direct sequel to Batman Forever. While both films are part of the same film series and share the same character of Batman, they were released six months apart (1995 and 1997) and have distinct storylines.  The passage mentions that Warner Bros. commissioned a sequel to Batman Forever, indicating that Batman & Robin was created as a new film, rather than a direct continuation of the story from Batman Forever.	92	
1760579209	1760579210	Passage: Badger -- Badgers are short-legged omnivores in the family Mustelidae, which also includes the otters, polecats, weasels, and wolverines. They belong to the caniform suborder of carnivoran mammals. The 11 species of badgers are grouped in three subfamilies: Melinae (Eurasian badgers), Mellivorinae (the honey badger or ratel), and Taxideinae (the American badger). The Asiatic stink badgers of the genus Mydaus were formerly included within Melinae (and thus Mustelidae), but recent genetic evidence indicates these are actually members of the skunk family, placing them in the taxonomic family Mephitidae.  Question: is a wolverine the same as a badger  Explain your choice.	No, a wolverine is not the same as a badger. Although both are members of the family Mustelidae and the caniform suborder of carnivoran mammals, they belong to different subfamilies and genera.  Wolverines belong to the subfamily Melinae, which also includes Eurasian badgers, whereas badgers are divided into three subfamilies: Melinae, Mellivorinae, and Taxideinae. The key difference lies in their genetic classification, with wolverines being part of a distinct family (Gulo) within the Mustelidae family, not the same subfamily as badgers.  So, while wolverines and badgers share some similarities, they are not the same species or even closely related enough to be considered the same.	160	
1760579210	1760579212	Passage: Green Lantern (film) -- Green Lantern was released on June 17, 2011, and received generally negative reviews; most criticized the film for its screenplay, inconsistent tone, choice and portrayal of villains, and its use of CGI, while some praised Reynolds' performance. Reynolds would later voice his dissatisfaction with the film. The film underperformed at the box office, grossing $219 million against a production budget of $200 million. Due to the film's negative reception and disappointing box office performance, Warner Bros. canceled any plans for a sequel, instead opting to reboot the character in the DC Extended Universe line with the film Green Lantern Corps, set for release in 2020.  Question: will there be a green lantern 2 movie  Explain your choice.	Based on the information provided, it appears that there will not be a Green Lantern 2 movie. The passage states that Warner Bros. canceled plans for a sequel to the 2011 film due to its negative reception and disappointing box office performance. This suggests that the studio decided not to pursue a follow-up film.  Additionally, the passage mentions that the character was rebooted in the DC Extended Universe with a new film, Green Lantern Corps, which was released in 2020. This implies that the character has been reimagined and rebranded, rather than continuing the story of the original film.  Therefore, it is likely that there will not be a Green Lantern 2 movie, at least not as a direct sequel to the 2011 film.	155	
1760579212	1760579213	Passage: United States and the International Criminal Court -- The United States should have the chance to observe and assess the functioning of the court, over time, before choosing to become subject to its jurisdiction. Given these concerns, I will not, and do not recommend that my successor, submit the treaty to the Senate for advice and consent until our fundamental concerns are satisfied.  Question: does the icc has jurisdiction in the united states  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, it appears that the author does not think the International Criminal Court (ICC) has jurisdiction over the United States. The author states that the US should have the ""chance to observe and assess the functioning of the court"" before becoming subject to its jurisdiction, implying that the author is hesitant to submit the treaty to the Senate for ratification until the author's concerns about the ICC's jurisdiction are addressed. This suggests that the author believes the ICC does not have jurisdiction over the United States, or at least not yet."	109	
1760579213	1760579214	Passage: Calcium carbide -- Calcium carbide is a chemical compound with the chemical formula of CaC. Its main use industrially is in the production of acetylene and calcium cyanamide.  Question: calcium carbide cac2 is the raw material for the production of acetylene  Explain your choice.	The statement is incorrect. The correct chemical formula for calcium carbide is CaC2, not CaC.  Calcium carbide, CaC2, is a compound made up of one calcium atom and two carbon atoms.   In the production of acetylene, calcium carbide is actually the raw material, not calcium carbide (CaC). The reaction between calcium carbide (CaC2) and water (H2O) produces acetylene (C2H2) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2):  CaC2 + 2H2O -> C2H2 + Ca(OH)2  So, the correct statement should be: Calcium carbide (CaC2) is the raw material for the production of acetylene.	162	
1760579214	1760579214	Passage: Now You See Me (film series) -- Now You See Me is a series of heist thriller film written by Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin, and Edward Ricourt. They focus on the actions of a team of illusionists named ``The Four Horsemen'' who pull off near impossible heists. The series features an ensemble cast including Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Michael Caine, Lizzy Caplan, and Morgan Freeman. The first film was released in 2013, while the second was released in 2016, and a third film is currently in development and set to be released in 2019. The series has received mixed reviews from critics and audiences and grossed nearly $700 million worldwide.  Question: is there a now you see me 3 coming out  Explain your choice.	Yes, according to the passage, there is a third film in the Now You See Me series currently in development and set to be released in 2019.	33	
1760579214	1760579215	Passage: Penalty shoot-out (association football) -- A shoot-out is usually considered for statistical purposes to be separate from the match which preceded it. In the case of a two-legged fixture, the two matches are still considered either as two draws or as one win and one loss; in the case of a single match, it is still considered as a draw. This contrasts with a fixture won in extra time, where the score at the end of normal time is superseded. Converted shoot-out penalties are not considered as goals scored by a player for the purposes of their individual records, or for ``golden boot'' competitions.  Question: does a penalty shoot out goal count towards the golden boot  Explain your choice.	"No, a penalty shoot-out goal does not count towards the golden boot.  According to the passage, ""Converted shoot-out penalties are not considered as goals scored by a player for the purposes of their individual records, or for ``golden boot'' competitions."" This suggests that penalty shoot-out goals are not included in the tally for the golden boot award, which is given to the player with the most goals scored during a competition."	86	
1760579215	1760579216	Passage: Cutthroat Kitchen -- Cutthroat Kitchen is a cooking show hosted by Alton Brown that aired on the Food Network from August 11, 2013 to July 19, 2017. It features four chefs competing in a three-round elimination cooking competition. The contestants face auctions in which they can purchase opportunities to sabotage one another. Each chef is given $25,000 at the start of the show; the person left standing keeps whatever money they have not spent in the auctions. The show ended on its fifteenth season in July 2017. The series shares some basic elements with other four-chef, three-round elimination-style competitions on Food Network including Chopped and Guy's Grocery Games. Numerous Cutthroat Kitchen contestants have competed on these shows.  Question: will there be a new season of cutthroat kitchen  Explain your choice.	Based on the information provided, it is unlikely that there will be a new season of Cutthroat Kitchen. The passage states that the show ended on its 15th season in July 2017, which suggests that the show has been cancelled. There is no mention of any plans for a revival or a new season, and the passage does not provide any information about the show's current status or any potential future episodes.	85	
1760579216	1760579216	Passage: Jack Sikma -- In 2006, Sikma was voted as one of the 100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament, a group of former players and coaches in honor of the 100 anniversary of the IHSA boys basketball tournament. On June 27, 2017, Sikma was inducted into the Small College Basketball Hall of Fame as part of their second class . Inducted alongside Sikma were Zelmo Beaty, Walt Frazier, Bob Love, Elmore Smith, Jim Spivey, Rico Swanson, George Tinsley, and Al Tucker.  Question: is jack sikma in the hall of fame  Explain your choice.	Yes, Jack Sikma is in the Hall of Fame.   This is supported by the information in the passage, which states that he was inducted into the Small College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2017, as part of their second class.	51	
1760579216	1760579219	Passage: Half-elven -- In J.R.R. Tolkien's fictional universe of Middle-earth, the Half-elven (Sindarin singular Peredhel, plural Peredhil, Quenya singular Perelda) are the children of the union of Elves and Men. Of these, the most significant were the products of couplings between the Eldar (the Elves who followed the Call to Valinor) and the Edain (the Men of the Three Houses of early Men who allied themselves with the Eldar in their war against Morgoth).  Question: can elves and humans mate lord of the rings  Explain your choice.	In J.R.R. Tolkien's fictional universe of Middle-earth, the concept of elven-human interbreeding is indeed possible, but it is not a common or widespread practice. However, it is not entirely ruled out either.  According to Tolkien's mythology, the Half-elven (Peredhel) are the offspring of Elves and Men. This occurs when an Elf, typically an Elf-lord or an Elf-maiden, has a child with a mortal Man, usually a member of the Edain (Men of the Three Houses). The most significant Half-elven are those who are the product of couplings between the Eldar (the Elves who followed the Call to Valinor) and the Edain.  However, it is worth noting that Tolkien's mythology does not describe the process of elven-human mating as a common or natural occurrence. Elves are depicted as being inherently different from Men, with their own distinct biology, culture, and destiny. The union between Elves and Men is often portrayed as a rare and exceptional event, usually resulting from circumstances such as war, exile, or diplomatic alliances.  In the context of The Lord of the Rings, there are a few instances of elven-human relationships and marriages, such as the union between Arwen and Aragorn (although Arwen is a Half-elven, and her mother is an Elf-maiden). However, these relationships are not depicted as being the norm or the result of a deliberate attempt to produce Half-elven offspring.  In summary, while it is possible for Elves and Men to mate and produce Half-elven offspring in Tolkien's universe, this is not a common occurrence and is often depicted as a rare and exceptional event.	348	
1760579219	1760579221	Passage: The Boy in the Plastic Bubble -- The Boy in the Plastic Bubble is a 1976 American made-for-television drama film inspired by the lives of David Vetter and Ted DeVita, who lacked effective immune systems. It stars John Travolta, Glynnis O'Connor, Diana Hyland, Robert Reed, Ralph Bellamy & P.J. Soles. It was written by Douglas Day Stewart, executive produced by Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg (who, at the time, produced Starsky and Hutch and Charlie's Angels), and directed by Randal Kleiser, who would work with Travolta again in Grease shortly after. The original music score was composed by Mark Snow. The theme song ``What Would They Say'' was written and sung by Paul Williams. William Howard Taft High School in Woodland Hills was used for filming.  Question: the boy in the plastic bubble based on true story  Explain your choice.	"The Boy in the Plastic Bubble is based on the true story of David Vetter, a young boy who was born with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), also known as ""bubble boy syndrome."" This rare genetic disorder made him extremely susceptible to infections and illnesses, forcing him to live in a plastic bubble to prevent exposure to germs.  The film's plot is inspired by the real-life experiences of David Vetter, who spent most of his life in a plastic bubble, surrounded by sterile conditions, to protect him from infections. The movie takes creative liberties with the story, but it is largely based on the true story of David Vetter's life and his struggles with SCID.  The film's portrayal of David's life, including his interactions with his family and medical team, is based on real events and people, including his relationship with his mother, Jean Vetter, and his interactions with his doctor, Dr. Joseph Murray. However, some artistic liberties were taken to dramatize the story for the screen.  Therefore, the answer to the question is yes, The Boy in the Plastic Bubble is based on a true story."	232	
1760579221	1760579223	Passage: A priori and a posteriori -- These terms are used with respect to reasoning (epistemology) to distinguish ``necessary conclusions from first premises'' (i.e., what must come before sense observation) from ``conclusions based on sense observation'' (which must follow it). Thus, the two kinds of knowledge, justification, or argument, may be glossed:  Question: science begins with the premise that knowledge should first be acquired through observation  Explain your choice.	"The passage is describing the distinction between ""a priori"" and ""a posteriori"" in the context of epistemology, which is the branch of philosophy that deals with the nature, sources, and limits of knowledge.  The passage explains that ""a priori"" refers to knowledge or reasoning that is based on principles or assumptions that do not rely on sense observation. In other words, a priori knowledge is what must be true independently of empirical evidence or observation. Examples of a priori knowledge include mathematical truths, logical principles, and metaphysical concepts.  On the other hand, ""a posteriori"" refers to knowledge or reasoning that is based on sense observation or empirical evidence. A posteriori knowledge is what follows from sense observation and experience. Examples of a posteriori knowledge include scientific theories, historical facts, and observational data.  In the context of the passage, the statement ""science begins with the premise that knowledge should first be acquired through observation"" suggests that scientific knowledge is based on a posteriori knowledge. This means that scientific theories and principles are derived from empirical evidence and observation, rather than from a priori reasoning or principles.  In other words, the passage is arguing that scientific knowledge is based on sense observation, rather than on independent a priori principles. This is consistent with the scientific method, which emphasizes the importance of empirical evidence and observation in the development of scientific theories and principles."	285	
1760579223	1760579223	Passage: Tim Brown (American football) -- Timothy Donell Brown (born July 22, 1966) is a former American football wide receiver who played professionally in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Notre Dame, where he won the Heisman Trophy, becoming the first wide receiver to win the award. He spent sixteen years with the Los Angeles/Oakland Raiders, during which he established himself as one of the NFL's most prolific wide receivers. Brown has also played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In 2015, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  Question: is tim brown in the hall of fame  Explain your choice.	"Yes, Tim Brown is in the Hall of Fame.  According to the passage, it states: ""In 2015, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame."" This directly confirms that Tim Brown has been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame."	57	
1760579223	1760579224	Passage: Drinking in public -- Drinking in public in Denmark is legal in general. The law forbids ``disturbing of the public law and order''. Thus general consumption is accepted. Several cafes have outdoor serving in the same zones.  Question: can you drink alcohol in public in denmark  Explain your choice.	Yes, you can drink alcohol in public in Denmark, but with certain restrictions. The passage states that drinking in public is generally accepted, as long as it does not disturb the public law and order. This means that you can consume alcohol in public places, such as cafes, as long as you are not causing any disturbance or disrupting the peace. However, it's worth noting that there may be specific areas or zones where drinking is not allowed, and it's always a good idea to check local rules and regulations before consuming alcohol in public.	109	
1760579224	1760579224	Passage: Jersey pound -- Both Jersey and Bank of England notes are legal tender in Jersey and circulate together, alongside the Guernsey pound and Scottish banknotes. The Jersey notes are not legal tender in the United Kingdom but are legal currency, so creditors and traders may accept them if they so choose.  Question: is jersey currency legal tender in the uk  Explain your choice.	"No, Jersey currency is not legal tender in the UK. According to the passage, it states that Jersey notes are ""not legal tender in the United Kingdom""."	33	
1760579224	1760579225	Passage: Milwaukee Bucks -- The Bucks have won one league title (1971), two conference titles (1971 and 1974), and 13 division titles (1971--1974, 1976, 1980--1986, 2001). They have featured such notable players as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Sidney Moncrief, Oscar Robertson, Bob Dandridge, Bob Lanier, Glenn Robinson, Ray Allen, Sam Cassell, Junior Bridgeman, Michael Redd, Terry Cummings, Vin Baker, Jon McGlocklin, Marques Johnson, and Brian Winters.  Question: have the milwaukee bucks ever won a championship  Explain your choice.	Yes, the Milwaukee Bucks have won a league title. According to the passage, they won one league title in 1971.	27	
1760579225	1760579225	Passage: List of FIFA World Cup penalty shoot-outs -- This is a list of all penalty shoot-outs that have occurred in the Finals tournament of the FIFA World Cup. Penalty shoot-outs were introduced as tie-breakers in the 1978 World Cup but did not occur before 1982. The first time a World Cup title was won by penalty shoot-out was in 1994. The only other time was in 2006. By the end of the 2018 edition, 30 shoot-outs have taken place in the World Cup. Of these, only two reached the sudden death stage after still being tied at the end of ``best of five kicks''.  Question: does the world cup final go to penalties  Explain your choice.	No, the World Cup final does not always go to penalties. According to the passage, penalty shoot-outs were introduced as a tie-breaker in the 1978 World Cup, but they only occurred for the first time in 1994, and only occurred twice (1994 and 2006) by the end of the 2018 edition. This suggests that most World Cup finals were decided by other means, such as regular play or other tie-breakers.	95	
1760579225	1760579227	Passage: Kingdom (manga) -- Kingdom (キングダム, Kingudamu) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yasuhisa Hara (原泰久, Hara Yasuhisa). The manga provides a fictionalized account of the Warring States period primarily through the experiences of the war orphan Xin and his comrades as he fights to become the greatest general under the heavens, and in doing so, unifying China for the first time in history. The series was adapted into a thirty-eight episode anime series by studio Pierrot that aired from June 4, 2012 to February 25, 2013. A second season was announced and aired from June 8, 2013 to March 1, 2014. An English language release of the anime was licensed by Funimation.  Question: is kingdom manga based on a true story  Explain your choice.	The Kingdom manga is not based on a true story. Although the series is set during the Warring States period of ancient China, a time of significant historical events, the story itself is fictionalized and not based on real historical figures or events.  The manga is an original work by Yasuhisa Hara, and while it draws inspiration from Chinese history and culture, it is not a direct retelling of actual events. The main character, Xin, and his comrades' experiences are not based on historical records, and the story is meant to be an imaginative interpretation of what life might have been like during that time period.  Therefore, it is classified as a work of fiction, rather than a historically accurate depiction of the Warring States period.	151	
1760579227	1760579227	Passage: European Economic Area -- As of 2014 the contracting parties to the EEA are 3 of the 4 EFTA member states and 27 of the 28 EU member states. The 28th and newest EU member, Croatia, finished negotiating their accession to the EEA in November 2013, and since 12 April 2014 is provisionally applying the agreement pending its ratification by all EEA member states.  Question: is croatia part of the european economic area  Explain your choice.	No, Croatia is not part of the European Economic Area (EEA) yet.  Although Croatia is a member of the European Union (EU) and has finished negotiating its accession to the EEA, its accession to the EEA is pending ratification by all EEA member states. As of 12 April 2014, Croatia is only provisionally applying the agreement, meaning it is not yet a full member of the EEA.	90	
1760579227	1760579228	Passage: Posthumous marriage -- Posthumous marriage (or necrogamy) is a marriage in which one of the participating members is deceased. It is legal in France and similar forms are practiced in Sudan and China. Since World War I, France has had hundreds of requests each year, of which many have been accepted.  Question: can u marry a dead person in france  Explain your choice.	Yes, it is possible to marry a dead person in France. According to the passage, posthumous marriage (or necrogamy) is legal in France.	34	
1760579228	1760579229	Passage: Saline (medicine) -- Saline, also known as saline solution, is a mixture of sodium chloride in water and has a number of uses in medicine. Applied to the affected area it is used to clean wounds, help remove contact lenses, and help with dry eyes. By injection into a vein it is used to treat dehydration such as from gastroenteritis and diabetic ketoacidosis. It is also used to dilute other medications to be given by injection.  Question: is saline and sodium chloride the same thing  Explain your choice.	"Yes, saline and sodium chloride are essentially the same thing.   Sodium chloride is the chemical name for table salt, which is composed of sodium and chlorine. Saline, on the other hand, is a colloquial or informal term that refers to a solution of sodium chloride in water. In other words, saline is simply a mixture of sodium chloride dissolved in water.  In medical contexts, the terms ""saline"" and ""sodium chloride"" are often used interchangeably, as they refer to the same substance. So, in the passage, ""saline"" and ""sodium chloride"" are referring to the same thing."	129	
1760579229	1760579229	Passage: Bubonic plague -- Several classes of antibiotics are effective in treating bubonic plague. These include aminoglycosides such as streptomycin and gentamicin, tetracyclines (especially doxycycline), and the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. Mortality associated with treated cases of bubonic plague is about 1--15%, compared to a mortality of 40--60% in untreated cases.  Question: is there a treatment for the bubonic plague  Explain your choice.	Yes, there are treatments for the bubonic plague. According to the passage, several classes of antibiotics are effective in treating the disease, including aminoglycosides (such as streptomycin and gentamicin), tetracyclines (especially doxycycline), and fluoroquinolones (such as ciprofloxacin).	74	
1760579229	1760579230	Passage: Joyce Summers -- The premise of the series is that Buffy is the latest Slayer, a young woman endowed by mystical forces with superhuman powers to fight and defeat vampires, demons, and other evil forces in the fictional town of Sunnydale. Like every Slayer before her, she was chosen and informed of her destiny when she was 15 years old. Her mother is unaware of her daughter's powers and responsibilities until Buffy is forced to tell her at the end of the second season of the television series. Although Joyce is shocked at this revelation, she recovers quickly and remains a source of stability for Buffy and Buffy's small circle of friends who assist her, dubbed the Scooby Gang. Eventually Joyce is able to take Buffy's dangerous demon-fighting in stride and even become proud and respectful of her daughter's abilities. Her natural death from an illness in the fifth season forces Buffy to face becoming an adult.  Question: does buffy's mom know she's a slayer  Explain your choice.	No, Buffy's mom, Joyce Summers, does not know that Buffy is a Slayer at the beginning of the series.   The passage states that Joyce is shocked when Buffy informs her of her destiny as a Slayer at the end of the second season, indicating that she was unaware of her daughter's powers and responsibilities until then.	66	
1760579230	1760579230	Passage: Leaning Tower of Pisa -- The tower's tilt began during construction in the 12th century, caused by an inadequate foundation on ground too soft on one side to properly support the structure's weight. The tilt increased in the decades before the structure was completed in the 14th century. It gradually increased until the structure was stabilized (and the tilt partially corrected) by efforts in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.  Question: was the leaning tower of pisa built leaning  Explain your choice.	No, the Leaning Tower of Pisa was not built leaning.  According to the passage, the tower's tilt began during construction in the 12th century, which means that it was originally built upright. The tilt occurred over time due to an inadequate foundation, causing the structure to lean as it was built. So, the tower was built upright, but it developed a noticeable lean over the centuries due to the foundation issues.	88	
1760579230	1760579232	Passage: Fool's Gold (2008 film) -- Fool's Gold is a 2008 American adventure-romance film from Warner Bros. Pictures about a recently divorced couple who rekindle their romantic life while searching for a lost treasure. The film was directed by Andy Tennant and reunites the How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days stars Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson.  Question: is the movie fool's gold a true story  Explain your choice.	"No, the movie ""Fool's Gold"" (2008) is not a true story. While the film is an adventure-romance that features a treasure hunt, it is a work of fiction.  The movie is a romantic comedy that was created to entertain and not based on real events. The plot, characters, and the treasure hunt itself are fictional. The film's storyline revolves around a fictional treasure, and the couple's journey is not based on actual people or events.  There is no historical or factual basis for the story of ""Fool's Gold"" being a true account of a lost treasure hunt or a rekindled romance between Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson. The film is an original screenplay written by Andy Tennant, and its purpose is to engage the audience with a fictional narrative."	167	
1760579232	1760579232	Passage: Super Bowl curse -- The home field curse affects the host team of the Super Bowl. So far no team has yet managed to reach the Super Bowl in their home stadium. Four teams with Super Bowls in their home venue have qualified for the divisional playoffs: the 1994 Miami Dolphins, the 1998 Miami Dolphins, the 2016 Houston Texans, and the 2017 Minnesota Vikings, the Vikings being the first to qualify for their conference's title game. From 1966--2011 (excluding the six Super Bowl games held in a stadium without a professional team), the Super Bowl host team has had 11 winning seasons, four split seasons, and 25 losing seasons. Mathematically, the probability of that many losing seasons or more occurring by chance (assuming a 50 percent chance of having a losing season (disregarding .500 seasons)) is 7.69 percent. It should be noted, however, that the Super Bowl host stadium is selected several years before the game is played, without regard to the teams that qualify.  Question: has any nfl team played the superbowl at home  Explain your choice.	"No, no NFL team has played the Super Bowl at home. The passage states that ""no team has yet managed to reach the Super Bowl in their home stadium,"" which implies that the Super Bowl is always played at a neutral site, not at the home stadium of the participating teams."	58	
1760579232	1760579233	Passage: State constitution (Australia) -- In Australia, each state has its own constitution. Each state constitution preceded the Constitution of Australia as constitutions of the then separate British colonies, but all the states ceded powers to the Parliament of Australia as part of federation in 1901.  Question: does each australian state have its own constitution  Explain your choice.	Yes, each Australian state has its own constitution.   The passage states that each state has its own constitution, which preceded the Constitution of Australia. This means that prior to the formation of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901, each state had its own separate constitution. Although they eventually ceded powers to the Parliament of Australia as part of federation, they still retain their individual constitutions.	79	
1760579233	1760579236	Passage: Bundle branch block -- A bundle branch block can be diagnosed when the duration of the QRS complex on the ECG exceeds 120 ms. A right bundle branch block typically causes prolongation of the last part of the QRS complex, and may shift the heart's electrical axis slightly to the right. The ECG will show a terminal R wave in lead V1 and a slurred S wave in lead I. Left bundle branch block widens the entire QRS, and in most cases shifts the heart's electrical axis to the left. The ECG will show a QS or rS complex in lead V1 and a monophasic R wave in lead I. Another normal finding with bundle branch block is appropriate T wave discordance. In other words, the T wave will be deflected opposite the terminal deflection of the QRS complex. Bundle branch block, especially left bundle branch block, can lead to cardiac dyssynchrony. The simultaneous occurrence of left and right bundle branch block leads to total AV block.  Question: can you have a right and left bundle branch block  Explain your choice.	"Yes, it is possible to have both right and left bundle branch block (RBBB and LBBB) simultaneously.  When both RBBB and LBBB occur, it is known as ""bilateral bundle branch block"" or ""bilateral bundle branch block."" This condition can occur in various contexts, such as:  1. Congenital conditions: Some people are born with bilateral bundle branch block, which can be present from birth. 2. Trauma or injury: Severe chest trauma can cause damage to the bundle of His, leading to bilateral bundle branch block. 3. Cardiac disease: Certain conditions, such as myocardial infarction (heart attack), can cause damage to the bundle of His, leading to bilateral bundle branch block. 4. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT): In some cases, patients with heart failure or other cardiac conditions may require CRT, which involves implanting a device to coordinate the heartbeat. CRT can sometimes cause bilateral bundle branch block.  Having both RBBB and LBBB can lead to cardiac dyssynchrony, which can worsen heart failure symptoms and reduce the effectiveness of CRT. Therefore, it is essential to diagnose and manage bilateral bundle branch block promptly to prevent complications.  The ECG findings for bilateral bundle branch block typically include:  * Widened QRS complexes in all leads (V1-V6) * Terminal R wave in lead V1 and a slurred S wave in lead I (for RBBB) * Monophasic R wave in lead I and a QS or rS complex in lead V1 (for LBBB) * T wave discordance, where the T wave is deflected opposite the terminal deflection of the QRS complex  It is crucial to note that a simultaneous diagnosis of RBBB and LBBB can be challenging, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed to confirm the diagnosis."	399	
1760579236	1760579237	Passage: Check (chess) -- In informal games, it is customary to announce ``check'' when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check. In formal competitions, however, check is rarely announced.  Question: do you always have to say check in chess  Explain your choice.	"No, you do not always have to say ""check"" in chess. According to the rules of chess, the announcement of ""check"" is not mandatory, especially in formal competitions. In fact, as the passage states, check is rarely announced in formal competitions.  However, in informal games, it is customary to announce ""check"" when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check. This is more of a social convention to help the opponent know that they are in danger of losing the game.  So, while it is not required by the rules, it is generally considered polite and sportsmanlike to announce ""check"" in informal games to alert the opponent. In formal competitions, the focus is on the gameplay and the outcome, and the announcement of ""check"" is not necessary."	163	
1760579237	1760579240	Passage: Australian Cattle Dog -- The Texas Heeler is a cross between the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Shepherd that was first registered with the Animal Research Foundation (ARF) in 1970. The ARF has registered Australian Cattle Dogs without papers as ``Australian Cattledog Queensland Heelers'' since 1965 and was the first organisation to recognise the Australian Shepherd. Although originally bred for its ability to work cattle, the Texas Heeler is increasingly used as a pet and a companion in dog sports. As with most cross breeds, the Texas Heeler's size and appearance is a variable combination of the parent breeds.  Question: is an australian shepherd the same as an australian cattle dog  Explain your choice.	No, an Australian Shepherd and an Australian Cattle Dog are not the same. Although they share a common ancestry and are often confused with each other, they are distinct breeds.  The main differences between the two breeds are:  1. Origin: Australian Cattle Dogs were originally bred in Australia to work on cattle stations, while Australian Shepherds were developed in the United States to herd sheep and other livestock. 2. Size: Australian Shepherds are generally smaller than Australian Cattle Dogs, with a typical weight range of 30-50 pounds (14-23 kg) compared to the Australian Cattle Dog's 30-60 pounds (14-27 kg). 3. Appearance: Australian Cattle Dogs have a more rugged and rough coat, with a distinctive blue or red speckled pattern, while Australian Shepherds have a medium-length coat with a merle or blue merle pattern. 4. Temperament: While both breeds are intelligent and energetic, Australian Cattle Dogs are known for their strong herding instinct and can be more independent and strong-willed, while Australian Shepherds are often more outgoing and people-oriented.  The Texas Heeler, mentioned in the passage, is a cross between an Australian Cattle Dog and an Australian Shepherd, which explains the variability in size and appearance.	270	
1760579240	1760579241	Passage: Tomato purée -- Tomato purée is a thick liquid made by cooking and straining tomatoes. The difference between tomato paste, tomato purée, and tomato sauce is consistency; tomato puree has a thicker consistency and a deeper flavour than sauce.  Question: is tomato puree and tomato sauce the same thing  Explain your choice.	No, tomato purée and tomato sauce are not the same thing. While both are made from tomatoes, the main difference lies in their consistency and flavor.  Tomato sauce is typically thinner and more liquidy, often used as a base for various dishes such as pasta sauces, soups, and stews. It's often cooked for a longer period to achieve a thinner consistency.  On the other hand, tomato purée is thicker and has a deeper flavor, often used in dishes where a more intense tomato flavor is desired, such as soups, sauces, and braising liquids. The cooking time for tomato purée is usually shorter, resulting in a thicker consistency.  So, while both are made from tomatoes, the key differences lie in their consistency and flavor profiles, making them distinct ingredients with different uses in cooking.	167	
1760579241	1760579242	Passage: The Blues Brothers -- The Blues Brothers are an American blues and soul revivalist band which was founded in 1978 by comedy actors Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi as part of a musical sketch on Saturday Night Live. Belushi and Aykroyd fronted the band, respectively in character as lead vocalist ``Joliet'' Jake Blues and harmonica player/vocalist Elwood Blues. The band was composed of well-known and respected musicians, and debuted as the musical guest on the April 22, 1978, episode of Saturday Night Live, opening the show performing ``Hey Bartender'', and later ``Soul Man''.  Question: is the blues brothers based on a true story  Explain your choice.	"No, the Blues Brothers are not based on a true story. While the band was inspired by the blues music and the Blues Brothers characters were fictional, they were created by comedy actors Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi as part of a musical sketch on Saturday Night Live. The characters of ""Joliet"" Jake Blues and Elwood Blues are composites of various blues musicians, but the story itself is not based on actual events or people."	92	
1760579242	1760579243	Passage: Newcastle upon Tyne -- Newcastle upon Tyne (locally /njuːˈkæsəl/ ( listen)), commonly known as Newcastle, is a city in Tyne and Wear, North East England, 103 miles (166 km) south of Edinburgh and 277 miles (446 km) north of London on the northern bank of the River Tyne, 8.5 mi (13.7 km) from the North Sea. Newcastle is the most populous city in the North East, and forms the core of the Tyneside conurbation, the eighth most populous urban area in the United Kingdom. Newcastle is a member of the English Core Cities Group and is a member of the Eurocities network of European cities.  Question: is newcastle upon tyne the same as newcastle  Explain your choice.	"Yes, Newcastle upon Tyne and Newcastle are the same city. The name ""Newcastle upon Tyne"" is an official name of the city, but it is commonly referred to as simply ""Newcastle"".  The name ""Newcastle upon Tyne"" is a geographical description, indicating that the city is located on the River Tyne. ""Upon Tyne"" is an old English phrase meaning ""on the Tyne"", and it was added to the city's name to distinguish it from other places with similar names (e.g. Newcastle-under-Lyme, Newcastle-under-May).  However, in modern usage, the city is usually referred to as Newcastle, and ""Newcastle upon Tyne"" is often used as a full name only when referring to the city's formal or official identity. So, while the two names are not exactly the same, they are interchangeable and refer to the same city."	183	
1760579243	1760579244	Passage: Post Office Ltd -- The Post Office provides information on services and accepts postal items and payment on behalf of the two collection and delivery divisions of Royal Mail Group, Royal Mail and Parcelforce. These include a variety of ordinary and guaranteed services both for delivery within the United Kingdom and to international destinations. Postage stamps (including commemorative stamps and other philatelic items) are sold, while applications for redirection of mail are accepted on behalf of Royal Mail.  Question: is post office and royal mail the same  Explain your choice.	No, Post Office Ltd and Royal Mail are not the same.  While they are related, they are two separate entities with distinct roles and functions.  Royal Mail is the UK's postal service provider, responsible for delivering mail and parcels across the United Kingdom and internationally. It is a trading brand of the Royal Mail Group.  Post Office Ltd, on the other hand, is a separate company that provides a range of financial services, including banking, bill payments, and money transfers. It operates a network of Post Office branches across the UK, which are authorized to accept postal items and provide a range of services, including the sale of postage stamps, redirection of mail, and payment processing.  While Post Office Ltd operates under the Royal Mail brand in some areas, such as accepting postal items and redirection of mail, it is a distinct business with its own separate identity and functions.	177	
1760579244	1760579246	Passage: Unsuccessful nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States -- Justices are nominated by the president and then confirmed by the U.S. Senate. A nomination to the Court is considered to be official when the Senate receives a signed nomination letter from the president naming the nominee, which is then entered in the Senate's record. There have been 37 unsuccessful nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States. Of these, 11 nominees were rejected in Senate roll-call votes, 11 were withdrawn by the president, and 15 lapsed at the end of a session of Congress. Six of these unsuccessful nominees were subsequently nominated and confirmed to other seats on the Court. Additionally, although confirmed, seven nominees either declined office or (in one instance) died before assuming office.  Question: has any supreme court nominee not been confirmed  Explain your choice.	Yes, a Supreme Court nominee has not been confirmed.  Although the passage states that 7 nominees declined office or died before assuming office, it does not necessarily mean that they were not confirmed. Confirmation is the process of the Senate approving the nomination, and it's possible that these nominees were confirmed but did not take office.  However, it's worth noting that the passage states that 11 nominees were rejected in Senate roll-call votes, which implies that they were not confirmed. Additionally, 15 nominations lapsed at the end of a session of Congress, which also means they were not confirmed.  So, there is at least one case where a nominee was not confirmed (the 15 nominations that lapsed at the end of a session of Congress), but there is no information provided about any nominee being confirmed and then declining office or dying before taking office.	174	
1760579246	1760579246	Passage: Thanksgiving (United States) -- Thanksgiving, or Thanksgiving Day, is a public holiday celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States. It originated as a harvest festival. Thanksgiving has been celebrated nationally on and off since 1789, after Congress requested a proclamation by George Washington. It has been celebrated as a federal holiday every year since 1863, when, during the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a national day of ``Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens,'' to be celebrated on the last Thursday in November. Together with Christmas and the New Year, Thanksgiving is a part of the broader fall/winter holiday season in the U.S.  Question: is thanksgiving always the last thursday of the month  Explain your choice.	No, Thanksgiving is not always the last Thursday of the month. According to the passage, it is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. This means that the date of Thanksgiving can vary between the 22nd and the 28th of November, as the fourth Thursday of November can fall on any date between these two days.	67	
1760579246	1760579247	Passage: The Lord of the Rings -- The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J.R.R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.  Question: is lord of the rings after the hobbit  Explain your choice.	"Yes, ""The Lord of the Rings"" is after ""The Hobbit"". The passage states that ""The Lord of the Rings"" is a sequel to ""The Hobbit"", which implies that ""The Hobbit"" came first. Therefore, ""The Lord of the Rings"" is the second book in the series, written by J.R.R. Tolkien."	73	
1760579247	1760579248	Passage: Fallen (2016 film) -- In December 2014, it was announced that Torment, the second installment in the Fallen book series, was in development. It is unknown whether the last two novels, Passion and Rapture, and the spin-off novel, Unforgiven, will be adapted as well. In 2017, producer Kevan Van Thompson asked the fans if they want an adaptation of ``Torment'', showing that the sequel still could be made.  Question: is the fallen movie going to have a sequel  Explain your choice.	"No, there is no indication in the passage that the Fallen movie has a sequel. In fact, the passage states that the second installment, ""Torment"", is in development, which implies that a sequel is being planned. However, it does not confirm that the movie has already been made or released. The passage also mentions that the status of the last two novels and the spin-off novel is unknown, which suggests that the sequel may not be a movie, but rather a book."	98	
1760579248	1760579248	Passage: List of most-followed Instagram accounts -- This list contains the top 50 accounts with the most followers on the social photo-sharing platform Instagram. As of October 2018, the most followed user is Instagram's own account, with over 260 million followers. Cristiano Ronaldo is the most followed individual, with over 144 million followers. Twelve accounts have exceeded 100 million followers on the site.  Question: does anyone on instagram have 1 billion followers  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, there is no information provided about anyone on Instagram having 1 billion followers. The passage only mentions that Cristiano Ronaldo has over 144 million followers, and Instagram's own account has over 260 million followers, but it does not mention anyone having 1 billion followers.	59	
1760579248	1760579248	Passage: Padmé Amidala -- George Lucas, Rick McCallum, and casting director Robin Gurland auditioned over 200 actresses for the part of Padmé Amidala. They chose 16-year-old actress Natalie Portman to play the role. According to The Phantom Menace production notes, ``The role required a young woman who could be believable as the ruler of that planet, but at the same time be vulnerable and open.'' Portman's performances in The Professional (1994) and Beautiful Girls (1996) impressed Lucas. He stated, ``I was looking for someone who was young, strong, along the lines of Leia. Natalie embodied all those traits and more.''  Question: in the phantom menace is padme the queen  Explain your choice.	"Yes, in ""The Phantom Menace"", Padmé Amidala is indeed the Queen of Naboo."	22

The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.  Question: is lord of the rings considered an epic  Explain your choice.	"Yes, ""The Lord of the Rings"" is considered an epic. Here's why:  1. **Scope and scale**: The story spans multiple continents, features a vast array of characters, and involves a grand struggle between good and evil on a universal scale, making it a sweeping narrative that encompasses a wide range of themes and settings.  2. **Hero's journey**: The story follows a classic hero's journey, with Frodo Baggins embarking on a perilous quest to destroy the One Ring, a perilous and transformative journey that tests his courage, loyalty, and resolve.  3. **Mythological and symbolic significance**: The novel is deeply rooted in mythology, drawing on Norse, Celtic, and Christian influences, and is rich in symbolism, with the One Ring serving as a powerful symbol of the corrupting influence of power and the struggle between good and evil.  4. **Epic length and complexity**: The novel is a long and intricate work, consisting of three volumes (The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King) that together span over 1,200 pages, making it a substantial and immersive read.  5. **Enduring popularity**: The novel's enduring popularity and influence, with over 150 million copies sold, is a testament to its epic scope and the depth of its storytelling, which continues to captivate readers to this day.  Overall, the combination of its grand scope, complex characters, mythological significance, and enduring popularity all contribute to ""The Lord of the Rings"" being considered an epic novel."	328	
1760579251	1760579252	Passage: Euro sign -- The euro sign (€) is the currency sign used for the euro, the official currency of the Eurozone in the European Union (EU). The design was presented to the public by the European Commission on 12 December 1996. The international three-letter code (according to ISO standard ISO 4217) for the euro is EUR. In Unicode it is encoded at U+20AC € euro sign (HTML &#8364; &euro; ). In English, the sign precedes the value (for instance, €10, not 10 €, unlike most other European languages). In some style guides, but not others, the euro sign is unspaced.  Question: does the euro sign go before the number  Explain your choice.	"Yes, the euro sign (€) is typically placed before the number, as in ""€10"". This is in line with the way it is written in English, according to the passage. This is also in contrast to how the sign is written in most other European languages, where the number comes before the sign."	65	
1760579252	1760579252	Passage: Induction cooking -- For nearly all models of induction cooktops, a cooking vessel must be made of, or contain, a ferrous metal such as cast iron or some stainless steels. The iron in the pot concentrates the current to produce heat in the metal. If the metal is too thin, or does not provide enough resistance to current flow, heating will not be effective. Most induction tops will not heat copper or aluminum vessels because the magnetic field cannot produce a concentrated current; ``all metal'' induction tops use much higher frequencies to overcome that effect. Any vessel can be used if placed on a suitable metal disk which functions as a conventional hotplate.  Question: can stainless steel be used on induction cooktop  Explain your choice.	"Yes, stainless steel can be used on induction cooktops. According to the passage, ""some stainless steels"" can be used, implying that not all stainless steels are suitable, but at least some types of stainless steel are compatible with induction cooking."	53	
1760579252	1760579254	Passage: Dismissal (employment) -- ``Firing'' is a common colloquial term in the English language (particularly used in the U.S.) for termination. The term ``firing'' may have been initiated in the 1910s at the National Cash Register Company. Other terms for dismissal are being ``sacked'', ``canned'', ``let go'', ``ran-off'', ``axed'', ``given walking papers'', ``given the pink slip'' or ``boned''. Other terms, more often used in Commonwealth countries, include ``to get the boot'' and ``to get the sack''.  Question: is job termination the same as being fired  Explain your choice.	No, job termination is not exactly the same as being fired. While the terms are often used interchangeably, there is a subtle difference between the two.  Job termination refers to the formal process of ending an employee's employment contract or relationship with an organization. It is a formal process that involves a company's decision to end an employee's employment, usually due to various reasons such as underperformance, misconduct, or restructuring. Job termination typically involves official procedures, notifications, and sometimes even severance packages.  Being fired, on the other hand, is a more colloquial term that implies a sudden or unexpected termination of employment. It can be a sudden dismissal without prior notice or warning, often due to poor performance or misconduct. Being fired can be a more abrupt and informal process, and it may not always involve the same level of formal procedures as job termination.  In other words, job termination is a formal process, while being fired is a more informal term that can imply a more sudden or unexpected outcome.	205	
1760579254	1760579256	Passage: Inattentional blindness -- In a 2015 study, Cary Stothart, Walter Boot, and Daniel Simons attempted to replicate and extend the findings from both Graham and Burke's 2011 study and Steven Most and colleague's 2000 study on Amazon Mechanical Turk using a sample of 515 participants that varied in age. In this study, participants were tasked with counting the number of times a number of white moving objects crossed the vertical midpoint of a display while ignoring a number of black moving objects. The unexpected object in this case was a gray cross that moved horizontally across the display at various distances from the vertical midpoint (this was manipulated between participants). Overall, they found that inattentional blindness susceptibility increases with age, which replicates the finding from Graham and Burke. In fact, they found that every 10 years of age was associated with a 1.3 fold increase in the probability of displaying inattentional blindness. They also found that the probability of inattentional blindness increases as the distance between the observer's focus of attention and the unexpected object increases, which replicates the finding from Most and colleagues. However, they also found that the relationship that age has with inattentional blindness does not change as a function of the unexpected object's distance from the focus of attention, suggesting that useful field of view does not mediate the relationship between age and inattentional blindness.  Question: does age have any influence on attentional ability or inattentional blindness  Explain your choice.	Yes, age has an influence on attentional ability and inattentional blindness. The study found that inattentional blindness susceptibility increases with age, with every 10 years of age being associated with a 1.3 fold increase in the probability of displaying inattentional blindness. This suggests that older adults are more prone to inattentional blindness, which is the inability to perceive and process certain stimuli that are within our visual field due to a lack of attention.  This increased susceptibility to inattentional blindness in older adults may be due to various factors, such as:  1. Decreased visual acuity: Older adults may have reduced visual acuity, making it harder to detect subtle changes or details in the visual field. 2. Reduced attentional resources: As people age, they may have less cognitive resources available for attention, leading to a greater likelihood of inattentional blindness. 3. Changes in the brain: Aging can affect the structure and function of the brain, particularly in areas responsible for attention, leading to decreased attentional abilities. 4. Decreased ability to divide attention: Older adults may have difficulty dividing their attention between multiple tasks or stimuli, leading to a greater likelihood of inattentional blindness.  Overall, the study suggests that age is a significant factor in attentional ability and inattentional blindness, with older adults being more susceptible to inattentional blindness due to a combination of visual and cognitive changes.	293	
1760579256	1760579258	Passage: Sanskrit -- Sanskrit belongs to the Indo-European family of languages. It is one of the three ancient documented languages that likely arose from a common root language now referred to as the Proto-Indo-European language:  Question: is sanskrit the first language of the world  Explain your choice.	No, Sanskrit is not the first language of the world. According to the passage, Sanskrit is a member of the Indo-European family of languages, which suggests that it evolved from a common root language known as the Proto-Indo-European language. This implies that Proto-Indo-European was the earliest known ancestor of the Indo-European languages, including Sanskrit.  In other words, Sanskrit is a descendant of Proto-Indo-European, not the first language of the world. The passage does not provide information about the origins of the first language of the world, as language origins are often a topic of debate and research among linguists and scholars.  However, some languages that are considered to be among the oldest languages in the world include:  * Sumerian (spoken in ancient Mesopotamia around 4500-1900 BCE) * Ancient Egyptian (spoken in ancient Egypt around 3200-300 BCE) * Tamil (spoken in southern India and Sri Lanka around 2000 BCE) * Chinese (spoken in China around 1200 BCE)  These languages are often considered to be among the oldest continuously spoken languages in the world, but it is difficult to determine which one is the very first language ever spoken.	253	
1760579258	1760579259	Passage: Jack Russell Terrier -- The Jack Russell Terrier is a small terrier that has its origins in fox hunting. It is principally white-bodied and smooth, rough or broken-coated but can be any colour.  Question: is a jack russell considered a small breed  Explain your choice.	Yes, a Jack Russell Terrier is considered a small breed.  Although the passage doesn't explicitly state the exact weight or height range of the Jack Russell Terrier, general information about the breed is available. Jack Russell Terriers typically weigh between 13-17 pounds (6-7.7 kg) and stand between 10-15 inches (25-38 cm) tall at the shoulder.  Considering these characteristics, the Jack Russell Terrier is generally classified as a small breed of dog.	102	
1760579259	1760579260	Passage: Air Force One -- The Air Force usually does not have fighter aircraft escort the presidential aircraft over the United States but it has occurred, for example during the attack on the World Trade Center.  Question: does air force one travel with fighter escort  Explain your choice.	No, the Air Force One typically does not travel with fighter escort over the United States.   The reason is that Air Force One, the presidential aircraft, is escorted by fighter aircraft primarily for its own protection and security when it is not on a domestic flight. However, when Air Force One is on a domestic flight over the United States, the aircraft is usually escorted by fighter jets, but only when the flight is in a sensitive or potentially high-risk environment, such as when the President is traveling to a high-profile event or location.   In general, when Air Force One is flying over the United States, it is typically escorted by F-15 or F-16 fighter jets from the 121st Air Refueling Wing, but not all domestic flights require an escort. The primary purpose of the escort is to provide an added layer of security and protection for the President, the First Family, and the crew.	184	
1760579260	1760579262	Passage: AR-15s in California -- The Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989 banned Colt AR-15 rifles by name in the State of California. California's 2000 Assault Weapons ban went further and banned AR-15s made by other manufacturers by name such as Bushmaster, PWA, and Olympic Arms.  Question: is it legal to own an ar15 in california  Explain your choice.	"Based on the provided passage, it appears that it is not entirely clear-cut whether it is legal to own an AR-15 in California.   The Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989 banned Colt AR-15 rifles by name in California. However, the 2000 Assault Weapons ban went further and banned AR-15s made by other manufacturers by name, such as Bushmaster, PWA, and Olympic Arms.   This implies that not all AR-15s are banned in California, only those made by specific manufacturers (Colt, Bushmaster, PWA, and Olympic Arms) that are designated as ""assault weapons"" under the 2000 ban.  Therefore, if you own an AR-15 that is not made by one of these specific manufacturers, it may not be banned. However, if you own one of these specific models, it would be considered an assault weapon and may be subject to restrictions or ban in California.  It is essential to note that firearms laws are subject to change, and this information may not be comprehensive or up-to-date. For accurate and current information, it's recommended to consult with a firearms expert or the relevant California authorities."	245	
1760579262	1760579263	Passage: The Star-Spangled Banner -- ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' is the national anthem of the United States. The lyrics come from ``Defence of Fort M'Henry'', a poem written on September 14, 1814, by the then 35-year-old lawyer and amateur poet Francis Scott Key after witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry by British ships of the Royal Navy in Baltimore Harbor during the Battle of Baltimore in the War of 1812. Key was inspired by the large U.S. flag, with 15 stars and 15 stripes, known as the Star-Spangled Banner, flying triumphantly above the fort during the U.S. victory.  Question: is the national anthem and star spangled banner the same  Explain your choice.	"Yes, the Star-Spangled Banner and The Star-Spangled Banner are the same.   The term ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" refers to the U.S. flag, which was described in Francis Scott Key's poem ""Defence of Fort M'Henry."" Later, this poem was set to the tune of the British song ""To Anacreon in Heaven,"" and it became the national anthem of the United States. The title ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" is also the title of the song, which is now the national anthem of the United States."	118	
1760579263	1760579263	Passage: Naples International Airport -- Naples International Airport (IATA: NAP, ICAO: LIRN) (Italian: Aeroporto Internazionale di Napoli) is the international airport serving Naples, Italy. It is located 3.2 NM (5.9 km; 3.7 mi) north-northeast of the city in the Capodichino district of Naples. The airport has two terminal buildings: Terminal 1 is for scheduled flights and Terminal 2, located away from the airfield, is used for charter operations.  Question: is there an international airport in naples italy  Explain your choice.	Yes, there is an international airport in Naples, Italy. The passage explicitly states that Naples International Airport is the international airport serving Naples, Italy.	30	
1760579263	1760579264	Passage: Cadbury Creme Egg -- Creme eggs are available annually between 1 January and Easter Day. In the UK in the 1980s, Cadbury made Creme Eggs available year-round but sales dropped and they returned to seasonal availability.  Question: can you buy cadburys creme eggs all year round  Explain your choice.	No, you cannot buy Cadbury Creme Eggs all year round. According to the passage, they are only available annually between 1 January and Easter Day.	33	
1760579264	1760579265	Passage: Homologous chromosome -- A couple of homologous chromosomes, or homologs, are a set of one maternal and one paternal chromosome that pair up with each other inside a cell during meiosis. Homologs have the same genes in the same loci where they provide points along each chromosome which enable a pair of chromosomes to align correctly with each other before separating during meiosis. This is the basis for Mendelian inheritance which characterizes inheritance patterns of genetic material from an organism to its offspring parent developmental cell at the given time and area.  Question: do homologous chromosomes carry information for the same traits  Explain your choice.	"Yes, homologous chromosomes carry information for the same traits. This is because homologous chromosomes are pairs of chromosomes that have the same genes in the same loci, meaning they have the same DNA sequence and genetic information.  In other words, homologous chromosomes are ""identical"" in terms of their genetic content, except for one small difference - the location of the difference is on a different chromosome. This difference is known as a crossover point, where one chromosome has a different version of a gene, while the other has the same version.  When these homologous chromosomes pair up during meiosis, they can exchange genetic material at the crossover points, which can lead to genetic variation and diversity. However, they share the same genetic information for many traits, which is why they are called homologous chromosomes.  This concept is a fundamental principle of Mendelian inheritance, which describes how genetic traits are passed down from parents to offspring. Homologous chromosomes play a crucial role in this process, as they provide a basis for the inheritance patterns of many genetic traits."	219	
1760579265	1760579266	Passage: Michigan Wolverines football -- Michigan began competing in intercollegiate football in 1879. The Wolverines joined the Big Ten Conference at its inception in 1896, and other than a hiatus from 1907 to 1916, have been members since. Michigan has won or shared 42 league titles, and, since the inception of the AP Poll in 1936, has finished in the top 10 a total of 38 times. The Wolverines claim 11 national championships, most recently that of the 1997 squad voted atop the final AP Poll.  Question: has michigan ever won a national championship in football  Explain your choice.	Yes, Michigan has won a national championship in football, according to the passage. The passage states that the 1997 squad was voted atop the final AP Poll, indicating that they were declared the national champions.	43	
1760579266	1760579268	Passage: Waiter Rule -- The Waiter Rule refers to a common belief that one's true character can be gleaned from how one treats staff or service workers, such as a ``waiter''. The rule was one of William H Swanson's 33 Unwritten Rules of Management, copied from Dave Barry's version ``If someone is nice to you but rude to the waiter, they are not a nice person.''  Question: you can tell a lot about a person by how they treat their waiter  Explain your choice.	I disagree with the passage. The passage suggests that one can tell a lot about a person by how they treat their waiter, but I believe this is an oversimplification.  While it's true that how someone treats service workers, such as waiters, can provide insight into their character, it's not a definitive indicator. Treating a waiter rudely or poorly may be a result of various factors, such as:  1. Bad day or stress: A person may be having a terrible day and take out their frustrations on the waiter, rather than being a reflection of their true character. 2. Cultural or personal differences: Different cultures or individuals may have varying expectations and norms for interacting with service workers, leading to misunderstandings or misinterpretations. 3. Lack of knowledge or training: A person may not know how to interact with service workers politely and professionally, leading to unintentionally rude behavior. 4. Stress or overwork: Service workers may be overwhelmed or exhausted, leading to mistakes or a lack of enthusiasm, which can be misinterpreted as rudeness.  Furthermore, the passage implies that treating a waiter rudely is a clear indicator of a person's true character, which is not necessarily the case. A person can be kind and polite to a waiter but still have other flaws or negative qualities.  In conclusion, while treating a waiter with respect and kindness can be a positive trait, it's not a definitive indicator of a person's character. Other factors and complexities should be considered when making judgments about someone's character.	314	
1760579268	1760579269	Passage: American crocodile -- Within the United States, the American crocodile's distribution is limited to the southern tip of Florida, though at least two have been found as far north as the Tampa Bay area. The current US population, estimated at 2,000, represents a significant recovery from a few hundred in the 1970s.  Question: are there any crocodiles native to north america  Explain your choice.	Yes, the American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) is native to North America. Although its population is limited to the southern tip of Florida, it is indeed native to this region. Additionally, there have been records of sightings in the Tampa Bay area, which is located in northern Florida. The fact that there have been at least two sightings as far north as the Tampa Bay area suggests that the American crocodile's range extends further north than previously thought.	96	
1760579269	1760579270	Passage: Lex Luthor (Smallville) -- Season seven displayed Lex's descent into darkness; he has a brother-like relationship with Grant Gabriel (Michael Cassidy), the new editor of the Daily Planet newest editor, until it's revealed Grant is actually a clone of Lex's late brother. After Lex buys the Daily Planet, Grant attempts to keep Lex from being controlling, thus Lex has his brother's clone murdered and staged as a failed mugging. Lex then discovers that the previous symbols are connected to the secret organization Veritas, which his father is a part of. The Veritas members learned that an alien visitor known as ``The Traveler'' would arrive in Smallville during the meteor shower of 1989. At this time, Lex realizes that Lionel has been covering up the Traveler's existence and subsequently kills his own father for it. He eventually discovers that the Veritas members knew of a means to control the Traveler, so Lex sets out to find the device. The device, an orb he finds in the mantle above a fireplace in the Luthor mansion, leads Lex to the Fortress of Solitude, where he is confronted by Clark. Having finally discovered Clark's secret, Lex uses the orb to bring down the Fortress around Clark and himself.  Question: does lex luthor know who superman is in smallville  Explain your choice.	Yes, Lex Luthor in Smallville does know who Superman is.   The passage states that Lex is driven by his desire to find and control the Traveler, an alien visitor that is connected to Superman's existence. When Lex discovers the orb that leads to the Fortress of Solitude, he is met with Clark Kent, who is Superman. This implies that Lex has already pieced together the connection between the Traveler and Superman, and has been searching for Superman throughout the series.	98	
1760579270	1760579271	Passage: Admission to the bar in the United States -- In the canonical case, lawyers seeking admission must earn a Juris Doctor degree from a law school approved by the jurisdiction, and then pass a bar exam administered by it. Typically, there is also a character and fitness evaluation, which includes a background check. However, there are exceptions to each of these requirements. A lawyer who is admitted in one state is not automatically allowed to practice in any other. Some states have reciprocal agreements that allow attorneys from other states to practice without sitting for another full bar exam; such agreements differ significantly among the states.  Question: do you have to have a college degree to take the bar exam  Explain your choice.	No, you don't necessarily have to have a college degree to take the bar exam. While many law students do have a college degree, it is not a requirement for admission to the bar exam. In the United States, admission to the bar typically requires a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from a law school approved by the jurisdiction, as mentioned in the passage. This means that the focus is on earning a law degree, rather than a college degree.	94	
1760579271	1760579272	Passage: Iron Fist (season 2) -- The second season of the American web television series Iron Fist, which is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, follows Danny Rand / Iron Fist, a martial arts expert with the ability to call upon the power of the Iron Fist. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films and other television series of the franchise. The season is produced by Marvel Television in association with ABC Studios, with Raven Metzner serving as showrunner.  Question: will there be a season 2 of marvel's iron fist  Explain your choice.	"No, there will not be a season 2 of Marvel's Iron Fist.  Although the passage does not explicitly state that there will not be a season 2, it does mention that the second season of Iron Fist is a completed season, as indicated by the phrase ""The second season of the American web television series Iron Fist"". This suggests that the second season has already been produced and released.  Additionally, the passage mentions that the show is part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), but it does not mention any plans for future seasons. The passage also mentions that Raven Metzner served as showrunner, which suggests that the show has been cancelled.  It's worth noting that the passage is from 2023, and since then, there have been no official announcements from Marvel about a revival or continuation of Iron Fist."	171	
1760579272	1760579273	Passage: Toll-free telephone numbers in the North American Numbering Plan -- In the United States of America, Canada, and other countries participating in the North American Numbering Plan, a toll-free telephone number has one of the area codes 800, 833, 844, 855, 866, 877, and 888.  Question: is 844 a toll free number in canada  Explain your choice.	No, 844 is not a toll-free number in Canada.  According to the passage, the toll-free numbers in the North American Numbering Plan are 800, 833, 844, 855, 866, 877, and 888. The passage specifically states that 844 is a toll-free number in the United States of America. However, it does not mention Canada.  In Canada, toll-free numbers typically start with 1-800, but 844 is not one of them. In Canada, the toll-free prefix is 1-800, 1-855, 1-866, 1-877, or 1-888.	139	
1760579273	1760579275	Passage: Daylight saving time by country -- Most areas in North America and Europe, and some areas in the Middle East, observe daylight saving time (DST), while most areas of Africa and Asia do not. In South America, most countries in the north of the continent near the equator do not observe DST, while Paraguay and southern parts of Brazil do. The practice of observing daylight saving time in Oceania is also mixed, with New Zealand and parts of southeastern Australia observing DST, while most other areas do not.  Question: does any other country have daylight savings time  Explain your choice.	Yes, many countries have daylight saving time (DST). The passage mentions that:  - North America (most areas) - Europe (most areas) - Middle East (some areas) - New Zealand - Parts of southeastern Australia  Additionally, some countries not mentioned in the passage also observe DST, such as:  - Many countries in the United States (not mentioned in the passage) - Canada (not mentioned in the passage) - Australia (not mentioned in the passage, but most of the country observes DST) - Some countries in South America, such as Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, in addition to Paraguay and southern Brazil - Some countries in Africa, such as South Africa and Egypt - Some countries in Asia, such as India, Japan, and South Korea  It's worth noting that DST is not observed in many countries, including:  - Most areas of Africa - Most areas of Asia - Most areas of South America (near the equator) - Oceania (most areas, except for New Zealand and parts of southeastern Australia)  In general, DST is observed in many countries around the world, but the specifics can vary greatly depending on the region and location.	239	
1760579275	1760579276	Passage: Johnny Vander Meer -- John Samuel Vander Meer (November 2, 1914 -- October 6, 1997) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a pitcher, most notably for the Cincinnati Reds. Vander Meer is best known for being the only pitcher in Major League Baseball history to throw two consecutive no-hitters. After the impressive start to his major league career, he experienced problems controlling the accuracy of his pitching, and his later career was marked by inconsistent performances.  Question: has anyone ever pitched back to back no hitters  Explain your choice.	Yes, someone else has pitched back-to-back no-hitters. In 2012, Philip Humber of the Chicago White Sox threw a perfect game against the Seattle Mariners, and the next day, Dallas Braden of the Oakland Athletics pitched a no-hitter against the Tampa Bay Rays.  This is the only instance in Major League Baseball history where a pitcher has achieved consecutive no-hitters, unlike Johnny Vander Meer who achieved consecutive no-hitters in 1938.	95	
1760579276	1760579276	Passage: Black Bike Week -- Black Bike Week, also called Atlantic Beach Bikefest and Black Bikers Week, is an annual motorcycle rally in the Myrtle Beach, South Carolina area, held on Memorial Day weekend. It is also sometimes called Black Fill-in-the-Blank Week, because it has evolved to attract many non-motorcycling visitors who come for music, socializing and enjoying the beach. Events include motorcycle racing, concerts, parties, and street festivals. Called a ``one-of-a-kind event'' and ``an exhibitionist's paradise'' by Jeffrey Gettleman, Black Bike Week is ``all about riding, styling and profiling,'' in the words of Mayor Irene Armstrong of Atlantic Beach, South Carolina.  Question: is there a black bike week in myrtle beach  Explain your choice.	Yes, according to the passage, there is a Black Bike Week in the Myrtle Beach area, specifically in Atlantic Beach, South Carolina. The passage states that Black Bike Week is an annual motorcycle rally held on Memorial Day weekend, and it has evolved to attract visitors for music, socializing, and enjoying the beach.	65	
1760579276	1760579277	Passage: Static (DC Comics) -- It was recently revealed that prior to his abduction, Static teamed with Justice League member Black Lightning in order to stop former Blood Syndicate member Holocaust, who had tried to kill the superhero while he was acting as the keynote speaker at Ernest Hemingway High's senior graduation.  Question: are static shock and black lightning the same person  Explain your choice.	"No, Static Shock and Black Lightning are not the same person.  Static Shock is a superhero in the DC Comics universe, and his real name is Virgil Hawkins. He gained his powers after being exposed to chemicals during a riot, which gave him superhuman abilities such as superhuman strength, speed, and agility.  Black Lightning, on the other hand, is also a DC Comics superhero, and his real name is Jefferson Pierce. He is a high school principal who gained superhuman speed after being shot with a Kevlar bullet. He uses his powers to fight crime and protect his community.  While both characters share the name ""Lightning"" in their superhero names, they are two separate and distinct characters with different powers and backgrounds."	151	
1760579277	1760579280	Passage: Unbreakable glass -- Unbreakable glass is glass, or glass substitute, which does not display the normal fragility of glass - in general the term is not used to refer to something that is absolutely unbreakable.  Question: is there such a thing as unbreakable glass  Explain your choice.	"While there isn't a type of glass that is completely unbreakable in the sense that it can withstand any impact or force without shattering, there are types of glass that exhibit significantly improved strength and resistance to breakage.  These types of glass are often referred to as ""unbreakable"" or ""impact-resistant"" glass. Some examples include:  1. Tempered glass: This type of glass is heat-treated to increase its strength and resistance to thermal shock. It can withstand sudden temperature changes and is often used in shower doors, bathtub enclosures, and other applications where safety is a concern. 2. Laminated glass: This type of glass is made by sandwiching a layer of plastic or polymer between two layers of glass. The plastic layer helps to absorb the impact of a break, reducing the likelihood of the glass shattering into sharp shards. 3. Fiberglass-reinforced glass: This type of glass is made by adding fibers to the glass matrix, which increases its strength and resistance to breakage. 4. Borosilicate glass: This type of glass is made with a specific type of oxide that reduces its thermal expansion, making it more resistant to thermal shock and less prone to breakage. 5. Ballistic glass: This type of glass is designed to withstand high-velocity impacts, such as those from bullets or other projectiles.  While these types of glass are not completely unbreakable, they are significantly more resistant to breakage than regular glass. However, it's essential to note that no glass is completely unbreakable, and proper installation, maintenance, and handling are still necessary to ensure the glass remains intact.  In summary, while there isn't a type of glass that is completely unbreakable, there are types of glass that exhibit improved strength and resistance to breakage, making them suitable for various applications where safety and durability are crucial."	387	
1760579280	1760579281	Passage: Liquid latex -- As the latex dries it becomes very sticky and will stick to itself if accidentally folded over. Most manufacturers offer a slick spray for latex once it is dry to take away the stickiness allowing the movement of the model's limbs. Alternatively, shimmer powders can be dusted over dried liquid latex to create metallic effects. One advantage to the tackiness of liquid latex is that it can act as an adhesive to attach things to the paint, such as zippers.  Question: can liquid latex be used as an adhesive  Explain your choice.	"Yes, liquid latex can be used as an adhesive. According to the passage, it states that ""One advantage to the tackiness of liquid latex is that it can act as an adhesive to attach things to the paint, such as zippers."" This suggests that liquid latex can be used to attach objects to a surface, specifically in this case to a painted surface."	74	
1760579281	1760579283	Passage: Gun laws in Texas -- Gov. Perry also signed H.B. 1815 after passage by the 2007 Legislature, a bill that allows any Texas resident to carry a handgun in the resident's motor vehicle without a CHL or other permit. The bill revised Chapter 46, Section 2 of the Penal Code to state that it is in fact not ``Unlawful Carry of a Weapon'', as defined by the statute, for a person to carry a handgun while in a motor vehicle they own or control, or to carry while heading directly from the person's home to that car. However, lawful carry while in a vehicle requires these four critical qualifiers: (1) the weapon must not be in plain sight (in Texas law, ``plain sight'' and ``concealed'' are mutually exclusive opposing terms); (2) the carrier cannot be involved in criminal activities, other than Class C traffic misdemeanors; (3) the carrier cannot be prohibited by state or federal law from possessing a firearm; and (4) the carrier cannot be a member of a criminal gang.  Question: is it illegal to carry a pistol in your car in texas  Explain your choice.	"Based on the passage, it appears that, yes, it is generally not entirely illegal to carry a pistol in your car in Texas, but there are certain conditions and qualifiers that must be met.  According to the passage, a Texas resident can carry a handgun in their motor vehicle without a CHL or other permit, as long as they meet four critical qualifiers:  1. The handgun is not in plain sight. 2. The carrier is not involved in criminal activities, other than Class C traffic misdemeanors. 3. The carrier is not prohibited by state or federal law from possessing a firearm. 4. The carrier is not a member of a criminal gang.  However, the passage specifically states that carrying a handgun in a vehicle is not considered ""Unlawful Carry of a Weapon"" under the statute, as defined by the Penal Code. This suggests that carrying a handgun in a vehicle, in and of itself, is not illegal, but rather, it's a matter of meeting the specified qualifiers.  Therefore, if you meet the four qualifiers, it is not entirely illegal to carry a pistol in your car in Texas. However, it's always a good idea to familiarize yourself with the specific laws and regulations regarding concealed carry in Texas, as there may be additional requirements or nuances that apply to your situation."	270	
1760579283	1760579285	Passage: Sgian-dubh -- When worn as part of the national dress of Scotland, the sgian-dubh is legal in Scotland, England and Wales. In Scotland under the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 Sec. 49, Sub-sec. 5(c); in England and Wales, under the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (section 139) and the Offensive Weapons Act 1996 (section 4).  Question: is it legal to carry a sgian dubh  Explain your choice.	Based on the information provided, it appears that the legality of carrying a sgian-dubh (also known as a dagger) varies by country:  - In Scotland: Yes, it is legal to carry a sgian-dubh in Scotland, as per the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 Sec. 49, Sub-sec. 5(c). - In England and Wales: The information provided does not explicitly state it is illegal to carry a sgian-dubh in England and Wales, but it does mention that there is an Offensive Weapons Act 1996 (section 4), which might imply some restrictions on carrying certain types of daggers or offensive weapons. However, it does not specifically mention the sgian-dubh.  Therefore, the most accurate answer is that it is legal to carry a sgian-dubh in Scotland, but the laws regarding its carry in England and Wales are not explicitly stated as illegal, but could be restricted.	205	
1760579285	1760579286	Passage: Hypoglossal nerve -- The hypoglossal nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve, and innervates all the extrinsic and intrinsic muscles of the tongue, except for the palatoglossus which is innervated by the vagus nerve. It is a nerve with a solely motor function. The nerve arises from the hypoglossal nucleus in the brain stem as a number of small rootlets, passes through the hypoglossal canal and down through the neck, and eventually passes up again over the tongue muscles it supplies into the tongue. There are two hypoglossal nerves in the body: one on the left, and one on the right.  Question: several cranial nerves innervate structures of the tongue  Explain your choice.	"Although the passage states that the hypoglossal nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve and is the only nerve that innervates the tongue, it is not entirely accurate to say that it is the only cranial nerve that innervates the tongue.  The passage also mentions that the palatoglossus muscle is innervated by the vagus nerve (the tenth cranial nerve). This means that there are two cranial nerves (the hypoglossal nerve and the vagus nerve) that innervate structures of the tongue.  So, the correct statement would be: ""several cranial nerves innervate structures of the tongue"", rather than the hypoglossal nerve being the only one."	149	
1760579286	1760579288	Passage: Puerto Rico -- Puerto Rico (Spanish for ``Rich Port''), officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (Spanish: Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, lit. ``Free Associated State of Puerto Rico'') and briefly called Porto Rico, is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea.  Question: is porto rico a part of the united states  Explain your choice.	Yes, Puerto Rico is part of the United States.  Although Puerto Rico is not a state, it is an unincorporated territory of the United States. This means that it is subject to the authority of the US government, but it does not have the same rights and powers as states. Puerto Rico is not part of the 50 states and does not have voting representation in the US Congress, but it is not governed by the US federal government in the same way that states are.  Puerto Rico's status as a territory is a result of a treaty between the US and Spain in 1898, after Spain ceded the island to the US as a result of the Spanish-American War. The island has been a US territory ever since, and while there have been several votes in which Puerto Ricans have considered seeking statehood, independence, or other forms of self-governance, its status remains unchanged.	186

In addition, due to the large number of Native American sovereign nations located within the state, sales-tax rates, if any, can vary based on state treaties with each nation.  Question: is there sales tax in the state of washington  Explain your choice.	Yes, there is a sales tax in the state of Washington. The statewide sales tax rate is 6.50%. However, local rates can vary based on location, and in some cases, there may be additional sales tax rates due to state treaties with Native American sovereign nations.	57
