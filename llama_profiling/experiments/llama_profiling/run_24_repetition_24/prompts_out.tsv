1760474277	1760474278	Passage: Persian language -- Persian (/ˈpɜːrʒən, -ʃən/), also known by its endonym Farsi (فارسی fārsi (fɒːɾˈsiː) ( listen)), is one of the Western Iranian languages within the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family. It is primarily spoken in Iran, Afghanistan (officially known as Dari since 1958), and Tajikistan (officially known as Tajiki since the Soviet era), and some other regions which historically were Persianate societies and considered part of Greater Iran. It is written in the Persian alphabet, a modified variant of the Arabic script, which itself evolved from the Aramaic alphabet.  Question: do iran and afghanistan speak the same language  Explain your choice.	No, Iran and Afghanistan do not speak the same language. Although they share a common historical and cultural heritage, the languages spoken in the two countries are different.  Iran is primarily inhabited by people who speak Persian (also known as Farsi), which is a Western Iranian language within the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family.  Afghanistan, on the other hand, is officially known as Dari since 1958, which is a dialect of Persian that is spoken in Afghanistan. However, it is distinct from the Persian spoken in Iran. Dari is a separate language with its own grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation, although it is mutually intelligible with Persian.  In other words, while Iran and Afghanistan share a common cultural and linguistic heritage, they have distinct languages that are not identical.
1760474278	1760474280	Passage: Good Samaritan law -- Good Samaritan laws offer legal protection to people who give reasonable assistance to those who are, or who they believe to be, injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. The protection is intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, for fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. An example of such a law in common-law areas of Canada: a good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing. Its purpose is to keep people from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in treatment. By contrast, a duty to rescue law requires people to offer assistance and holds those who fail to do so liable.  Question: do good samaritan laws protect those who help at an accident  Explain your choice.	Yes, good Samaritan laws protect those who help at an accident. According to the passage, the purpose of these laws is to "reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist" in emergency situations, implying that they provide legal protection to people who give reasonable assistance to those who are injured, ill, or in peril.  In other words, good Samaritan laws shield individuals who provide assistance in emergency situations, such as an accident, from being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. This means that if someone helps someone in distress after an accident and makes a reasonable effort to provide assistance, they are generally protected from liability, as long as they did not act with reckless disregard for the person's safety.  However, it's essential to note that the protection provided by good Samaritan laws varies by jurisdiction, and the specific laws and regulations can differ depending on the location. Additionally, the laws do not provide blanket protection, and there may be exceptions or limitations to the protection offered.
1760474280	1760474280	Passage: Windows Movie Maker -- Windows Movie Maker (formerly known as Windows Live Movie Maker in Windows 7) is a discontinued video editing software by Microsoft. It is a part of Windows Essentials software suite and offers the ability to create and edit videos as well as to publish them on OneDrive, Facebook, Vimeo, YouTube, and Flickr.  Question: is windows movie maker part of windows essentials  Explain your choice.	Yes, Windows Movie Maker is part of the Windows Essentials software suite.   The reason for this is that Windows Essentials is a set of Microsoft software applications that are designed to work together to provide a suite of tools for home users. Windows Movie Maker was one of the applications included in Windows Essentials until it was discontinued.
1760474280	1760474282	Passage: Powdered sugar -- Powdered sugar, also called confectioners' sugar, icing sugar, and icing cake, is a finely ground sugar produced by milling granulated sugar into a powdered state. It usually contains a small amount of anti-caking agent to prevent clumping and improve flow. Although most often produced in a factory, powdered sugar can also be made by processing ordinary granulated sugar in a coffee grinder, or by crushing it by hand in a mortar and pestle.  Question: is confectionary sugar the same as powdered sugar  Explain your choice.	No, confectioner's sugar and powdered sugar are not exactly the same, although they are often used interchangeably. The difference lies in the size of the sugar particles and the presence of anti-caking agents.  Confectioner's sugar is a type of powdered sugar that has a finer texture and is often used for decorating and dusting baked goods, such as cakes and pastries. It is usually made from granulated sugar that has been milled to a finer powder, resulting in a smoother and more even texture.  Powdered sugar, on the other hand, is a more general term that can refer to either confectioner's sugar or a coarser, more granular powdered sugar that may not be as finely milled. Powdered sugar may also contain anti-caking agents to prevent clumping, but it may not be as fine as confectioner's sugar.  In summary, confectioner's sugar is a specific type of powdered sugar with a finer texture, while powdered sugar is a more general term that can refer to either confectioner's sugar or a coarser variety.
1760474282	1760474284	Passage: The Elder Scrolls Online -- As with other games in The Elder Scrolls series, the game is set on the continent of Tamriel. The events of the game occur a millennium before those of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and around 800 years before The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. It has a broadly similar structure to Skyrim, with two separate conflicts progressing at the same time, one with the fate of the world in the balance, and one where the prize is supreme power on Tamriel. In The Elder Scrolls Online, the first struggle is against the Daedric Prince Molag Bal, who is attempting to meld the plane of Mundus with his realm of Coldharbour, and the second is to capture the vacant imperial throne, contested by three alliances of the mortal races. The player character has been sacrificed to Molag Bal, and Molag Bal has stolen their soul, the recovery of which is the primary game objective.  Question: is elder scrolls online the same as skyrim  Explain your choice.	No, The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) is not the same as Skyrim. Although they share some similarities, they are two distinct games in the Elder Scrolls series. Here's why:  1. **Time period**: As mentioned in the passage, the events of ESO occur around 800 years before the events of Skyrim, which means they take place in a different era of Tamriel's history. 2. **Storyline**: The two games have separate storylines, with ESO focusing on the struggle against Daedric Prince Molag Bal and the recovery of the player's soul, while Skyrim's storyline revolves around the return of the Dragonborn and the fight against Alduin the World-Eater. 3. **Gameplay structure**: While both games have a similar structure with multiple conflicts happening simultaneously, the specifics of these conflicts and the player's role in them differ. 4. **Setting**: Although both games are set in the continent of Tamriel, the specific locations, factions, and geography are distinct in each game.  In summary, The Elder Scrolls Online is a separate game with its own unique story, setting, and gameplay mechanics, even if it shares some similarities with Skyrim.
1760474284	1760474285	Passage: Epsom railway station -- Epsom railway station serves the town of Epsom in Surrey. It is located off Waterloo Road and is less than two minutes' walk from the High Street. It is not in the London Oyster card zone unlike Epsom Downs or Tattenham Corner stations. The station building was replaced in 2012/2013 with a new building with apartments above the station (see end of article).  Question: can you use oyster card at epsom station  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, it is not possible to use an Oyster card at Epsom railway station. The passage states that Epsom railway station is "not in the London Oyster card zone". This indicates that Epsom station is outside of the London Oyster card area, and therefore, Oyster cards are not accepted.
1760474285	1760474286	Passage: Da Vinci's Demons -- The series premiered in the United States on Starz on 12 April 2013, and its second season premiered on 22 March 2014. The series was renewed for a third season, which premiered on 24 October 2015. On 23 July 2015, Starz announced that the third season would be the show's last. However Goyer has left it open for a miniseries return.  Question: will there be a season 4 of da vinci's demons  Explain your choice.	Based on the information provided in the passage, it is unlikely that there will be a Season 4 of Da Vinci's Demons. The passage states that the show was announced to be the last season (Season 3) in 2015, and there is no mention of any plans for a revival or continuation of the series.  However, it's worth noting that the passage does mention that screenwriter Tom Wheeler has left the door open for a potential miniseries return, which could potentially revive the series in the future. But as of the provided information, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that Season 4 is in production or planned.  Therefore, based on the information provided, the most likely answer is that there will not be a Season 4 of Da Vinci's Demons.
1760474286	1760474287	Passage: Federal judiciary of the United States -- The federal courts are composed of three levels of courts. The Supreme Court of the United States is the court of last resort. It is generally an appellate court that operates under discretionary review, which means that the Court can choose which cases to hear, by granting writs of certiorari. There is therefore generally no basic right of appeal that extends automatically all the way to the Supreme Court. In a few situations (like lawsuits between state governments or some cases between the federal government and a state) it sits as a court of original jurisdiction.  Question: is the federal court the same as the supreme court  Explain your choice.	No, the federal court is not the same as the Supreme Court.  According to the passage, the federal courts are composed of three levels of courts, with the Supreme Court being the "court of last resort" and the highest level. The federal court is a broader term that encompasses all three levels of federal courts, while the Supreme Court is a specific court that operates under discretionary review and is the final arbiter in most cases.  In other words, all federal courts are part of the federal judiciary, but not all federal courts are the Supreme Court.
1760474287	1760474288	Passage: Bixby letter -- In the 1998 war film Saving Private Ryan, General George Marshall (played by Harve Presnell) reads the Bixby letter to his officers before giving the order to find and send home Private James Francis Ryan after Ryan's three brothers died in battle.  Question: did abraham lincoln write the letter in saving private ryan  Explain your choice.	No, Abraham Lincoln did not write the letter in the 1998 film Saving Private Ryan.  The passage actually states that General George Marshall reads the Bixby letter to his officers before giving the order to find and send home Private James Francis Ryan.   The Bixby letter is likely referring to the 1863 letter from Private Henry Bixby to Colonel Robert Allan, in which Bixby asks Allan to find and rescue Private James Francis Ryan, a soldier from Illinois who was the last surviving brother of four servicemen from the same family, all of whom had died in action during World War II.  Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, died in 1865, more than 80 years before the events depicted in Saving Private Ryan, which took place during World War II.
1760474288	1760474289	Passage: Batman & Robin (film) -- With the box office success of Batman Forever in June 1995, Warner Bros. immediately commissioned a sequel. They hired director Joel Schumacher and writer Akiva Goldsman to reprise their duties the following August, and decided it was best to fast track production for a June 1997 target release date, which is a break from the usual 3-year gap between films. Schumacher wanted to homage both the broad camp style of the 1960s television series and the work of Dick Sprang. The storyline of Batman & Robin was conceived by Schumacher and Goldsman during pre-production on A Time to Kill. Portions of Mr. Freeze's back-story were based on the Batman: The Animated Series episode ``Heart of Ice'', written by Paul Dini.  Question: is batman and robin a sequel to batman forever  Explain your choice.	Yes, "Batman & Robin" is a sequel to "Batman Forever".   The passage states that the box office success of "Batman Forever" led to the decision to commission a sequel, with Joel Schumacher and Akiva Goldsman rejoining the team to reprise their duties. This indicates a direct continuation of the story and characters from the previous film, making it a sequel.
1760474289	1760474290	Passage: Badger -- Badgers are short-legged omnivores in the family Mustelidae, which also includes the otters, polecats, weasels, and wolverines. They belong to the caniform suborder of carnivoran mammals. The 11 species of badgers are grouped in three subfamilies: Melinae (Eurasian badgers), Mellivorinae (the honey badger or ratel), and Taxideinae (the American badger). The Asiatic stink badgers of the genus Mydaus were formerly included within Melinae (and thus Mustelidae), but recent genetic evidence indicates these are actually members of the skunk family, placing them in the taxonomic family Mephitidae.  Question: is a wolverine the same as a badger  Explain your choice.	No, a wolverine is not the same as a badger. Although both are members of the same family (Mustelidae) and suborder (Carnivora), they belong to different genera and are distinct species.  Wolverines belong to the genus Gulo, while badgers belong to the genera various species within the three subfamilies: Melinae (Eurasian badgers), Mellivorinae (honey badger or ratel), and Taxideinae (American badger).  Additionally, wolverines are more closely related to weasels and otters, whereas badgers are more closely related to polecats. The passage also mentions that wolverines are not part of the same taxonomic group as badgers, as they are not in the same genus (Gulo is not in the genus Melinae, Mellivorinae, or Taxideinae).
1760474290	1760474291	Passage: Green Lantern (film) -- Green Lantern was released on June 17, 2011, and received generally negative reviews; most criticized the film for its screenplay, inconsistent tone, choice and portrayal of villains, and its use of CGI, while some praised Reynolds' performance. Reynolds would later voice his dissatisfaction with the film. The film underperformed at the box office, grossing $219 million against a production budget of $200 million. Due to the film's negative reception and disappointing box office performance, Warner Bros. canceled any plans for a sequel, instead opting to reboot the character in the DC Extended Universe line with the film Green Lantern Corps, set for release in 2020.  Question: will there be a green lantern 2 movie  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, it is unlikely that there will be a Green Lantern 2 movie. The passage states that Warner Bros. canceled any plans for a sequel to the 2011 film, and instead opted to reboot the character in the DC Extended Universe with the film Green Lantern Corps, set for release in 2020. This suggests that the original film was deemed unworthy of a sequel, and that the studio is instead choosing to start anew with a new film.
1760474291	1760474292	Passage: United States and the International Criminal Court -- The United States should have the chance to observe and assess the functioning of the court, over time, before choosing to become subject to its jurisdiction. Given these concerns, I will not, and do not recommend that my successor, submit the treaty to the Senate for advice and consent until our fundamental concerns are satisfied.  Question: does the icc has jurisdiction in the united states  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, it can be inferred that the ICC (International Criminal Court) does not have jurisdiction in the United States. The passage states that the speaker will not recommend submitting the treaty to the Senate for advice and consent until the US has had a chance to "observe and assess the functioning of the court" over time, implying that the US has reservations about the ICC's jurisdiction.  This suggests that the US is hesitant to submit to the ICC's jurisdiction, and the passage does not explicitly state that the ICC has jurisdiction over the US. In fact, the US has historically been opposed to the ICC's jurisdiction over its citizens and territories, and the passage reflects this opposition.
1760474292	1760474293	Passage: Calcium carbide -- Calcium carbide is a chemical compound with the chemical formula of CaC. Its main use industrially is in the production of acetylene and calcium cyanamide.  Question: calcium carbide cac2 is the raw material for the production of acetylene  Explain your choice.	I would say that the statement is not entirely accurate.  The correct chemical formula for calcium carbide is actually CaC2, not CaC. Calcium carbide is a chemical compound composed of calcium (Ca) and carbon (C) in a 2:1 ratio.  The reaction to produce acetylene from calcium carbide is:  CaC2 + 2CaC → 2Ca + C2H2 (acetylene)  So, calcium carbide (CaC2) is indeed a raw material for the production of acetylene, but the correct chemical formula for calcium carbide is CaC2, not CaC.
1760474293	1760474294	Passage: Now You See Me (film series) -- Now You See Me is a series of heist thriller film written by Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin, and Edward Ricourt. They focus on the actions of a team of illusionists named ``The Four Horsemen'' who pull off near impossible heists. The series features an ensemble cast including Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Michael Caine, Lizzy Caplan, and Morgan Freeman. The first film was released in 2013, while the second was released in 2016, and a third film is currently in development and set to be released in 2019. The series has received mixed reviews from critics and audiences and grossed nearly $700 million worldwide.  Question: is there a now you see me 3 coming out  Explain your choice.	Yes, there is a Now You See Me 3 coming out. According to the passage, it states that a third film in the series is currently in development and set to be released in 2019.
1760474294	1760474294	Passage: Penalty shoot-out (association football) -- A shoot-out is usually considered for statistical purposes to be separate from the match which preceded it. In the case of a two-legged fixture, the two matches are still considered either as two draws or as one win and one loss; in the case of a single match, it is still considered as a draw. This contrasts with a fixture won in extra time, where the score at the end of normal time is superseded. Converted shoot-out penalties are not considered as goals scored by a player for the purposes of their individual records, or for ``golden boot'' competitions.  Question: does a penalty shoot out goal count towards the golden boot  Explain your choice.	No, a penalty shoot-out goal does not count towards the "golden boot" competitions.  According to the passage, converted shoot-out penalties are not considered as goals scored by a player for the purposes of their individual records, or for "golden boot" competitions.
1760474294	1760474295	Passage: Cutthroat Kitchen -- Cutthroat Kitchen is a cooking show hosted by Alton Brown that aired on the Food Network from August 11, 2013 to July 19, 2017. It features four chefs competing in a three-round elimination cooking competition. The contestants face auctions in which they can purchase opportunities to sabotage one another. Each chef is given $25,000 at the start of the show; the person left standing keeps whatever money they have not spent in the auctions. The show ended on its fifteenth season in July 2017. The series shares some basic elements with other four-chef, three-round elimination-style competitions on Food Network including Chopped and Guy's Grocery Games. Numerous Cutthroat Kitchen contestants have competed on these shows.  Question: will there be a new season of cutthroat kitchen  Explain your choice.	Based on the given information, it is unlikely that there will be a new season of Cutthroat Kitchen. The passage states that the show ended on its 15th season in July 2017. This suggests that the show has been canceled and there are no plans for a new season.  Additionally, the passage mentions that the show shares elements with other Food Network shows, such as Chopped and Guy's Grocery Games, which may be airing new seasons, but there is no indication that Cutthroat Kitchen will be revived. The passage also mentions that numerous Cutthroat Kitchen contestants have competed on other shows, which may suggest that the show has concluded its run.  Therefore, based on the available information, it is unlikely that there will be a new season of Cutthroat Kitchen.
1760474295	1760474296	Passage: Jack Sikma -- In 2006, Sikma was voted as one of the 100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament, a group of former players and coaches in honor of the 100 anniversary of the IHSA boys basketball tournament. On June 27, 2017, Sikma was inducted into the Small College Basketball Hall of Fame as part of their second class . Inducted alongside Sikma were Zelmo Beaty, Walt Frazier, Bob Love, Elmore Smith, Jim Spivey, Rico Swanson, George Tinsley, and Al Tucker.  Question: is jack sikma in the hall of fame  Explain your choice.	Yes, Jack Sikma is in the hall of fame.   This is confirmed by the passage, which states that Jack Sikma was inducted into the Small College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2017.
1760474296	1760474298	Passage: Half-elven -- In J.R.R. Tolkien's fictional universe of Middle-earth, the Half-elven (Sindarin singular Peredhel, plural Peredhil, Quenya singular Perelda) are the children of the union of Elves and Men. Of these, the most significant were the products of couplings between the Eldar (the Elves who followed the Call to Valinor) and the Edain (the Men of the Three Houses of early Men who allied themselves with the Eldar in their war against Morgoth).  Question: can elves and humans mate lord of the rings  Explain your choice.	According to J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium, elves and humans can indeed interbreed, resulting in Half-Elves. However, the passage provided does not explicitly mention that elves and humans can mate with a "Lord of the Rings" character.  In Tolkien's world, the Half-Elves are the offspring of Elves and Men, as stated in the passage. There is no indication that a specific character referred to as a "Lord of the Rings" exists in this context.  In the context of The Lord of the Rings, the term "Lord of the Rings" refers to the One Ring, a powerful and central plot element in the story. The main characters in the book are not referred to as "Lords of the Rings." If you are referring to the characters in The Lord of the Rings, such as Aragorn, Legolas, or Gimli, they are all Half-Elves or other specific types of characters, but not specifically referred to as "Lords of the Rings."  Therefore, it is not possible to determine the mating of elves and humans with a character referred to as a "Lord of the Rings" based on the provided passage.
1760474298	1760474299	Passage: The Boy in the Plastic Bubble -- The Boy in the Plastic Bubble is a 1976 American made-for-television drama film inspired by the lives of David Vetter and Ted DeVita, who lacked effective immune systems. It stars John Travolta, Glynnis O'Connor, Diana Hyland, Robert Reed, Ralph Bellamy & P.J. Soles. It was written by Douglas Day Stewart, executive produced by Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg (who, at the time, produced Starsky and Hutch and Charlie's Angels), and directed by Randal Kleiser, who would work with Travolta again in Grease shortly after. The original music score was composed by Mark Snow. The theme song ``What Would They Say'' was written and sung by Paul Williams. William Howard Taft High School in Woodland Hills was used for filming.  Question: the boy in the plastic bubble based on true story  Explain your choice.	Yes, "The Boy in the Plastic Bubble" is based on a true story. The film is inspired by the lives of David Vetter and Ted DeVita, who both suffered from severe immunodeficiency disorders. David Vetter, also known as the "Boy in the Bubble," was a boy who was born with a rare form of immunodeficiency disease called severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). He was isolated from the outside world due to his compromised immune system, and lived in a plastic bubble for most of his life.   David Vetter's story was widely publicized, and his life was studied by many scientists, including Dr. José Antonio López, who helped develop the first treatment for his condition. The film is a dramatization of David Vetter's life, and it takes some creative liberties to enhance the storytelling, but it is rooted in his true story.  The film also mentions Ted DeVita, another individual with a similar condition, which further supports the fact that the story is based on real events.
1760474299	1760474302	Passage: A priori and a posteriori -- These terms are used with respect to reasoning (epistemology) to distinguish ``necessary conclusions from first premises'' (i.e., what must come before sense observation) from ``conclusions based on sense observation'' (which must follow it). Thus, the two kinds of knowledge, justification, or argument, may be glossed:  Question: science begins with the premise that knowledge should first be acquired through observation  Explain your choice.	The passage is discussing the distinction between two types of reasoning in epistemology: a priori and a posteriori.  The terms "a priori" and "a posteriori" are used to describe two different approaches to knowledge acquisition.  "A priori" refers to knowledge or justification that is independent of sense observation. This type of knowledge is considered to be "before" (or "a prior to") sense observation. Examples of a priori knowledge include mathematical truths, logical principles, and metaphysical truths that can be known independently of experience. In other words, these are conclusions that must be true regardless of whether we observe the world.  On the other hand, "a posteriori" refers to knowledge or justification that is based on sense observation. This type of knowledge is considered to be "after" (or "posterior to") sense observation. Examples of a posteriori knowledge include scientific knowledge, historical knowledge, and factual knowledge that can be verified through observation and experimentation. In other words, these are conclusions that are derived from sense observation.  The passage suggests that science begins with the premise that knowledge should be acquired through observation. This is because science is an a posteriori discipline that relies on sense observation to establish its conclusions. In other words, scientific knowledge is derived from empirical evidence and observations of the world, rather than from a priori reasoning alone.  In this context, the passage is explaining why science starts with observation: because a posteriori knowledge is the only type of knowledge that can be verified through sense observation, and science relies on this type of knowledge to establish its conclusions.
1760474302	1760474302	Passage: Tim Brown (American football) -- Timothy Donell Brown (born July 22, 1966) is a former American football wide receiver who played professionally in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Notre Dame, where he won the Heisman Trophy, becoming the first wide receiver to win the award. He spent sixteen years with the Los Angeles/Oakland Raiders, during which he established himself as one of the NFL's most prolific wide receivers. Brown has also played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In 2015, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  Question: is tim brown in the hall of fame  Explain your choice.	Yes, Tim Brown is in the Hall of Fame.  The passage states that Tim Brown was "inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2015". This clearly indicates that he was a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, a prestigious honor bestowed upon the greatest players in NFL history.
1760474302	1760474303	Passage: Drinking in public -- Drinking in public in Denmark is legal in general. The law forbids ``disturbing of the public law and order''. Thus general consumption is accepted. Several cafes have outdoor serving in the same zones.  Question: can you drink alcohol in public in denmark  Explain your choice.	Yes, you can drink alcohol in public in Denmark. According to the passage, the law only prohibits "disturbing of the public law and order", which implies that general consumption of alcohol in public is allowed as long as it is not causing a disturbance.
1760474303	1760474303	Passage: Jersey pound -- Both Jersey and Bank of England notes are legal tender in Jersey and circulate together, alongside the Guernsey pound and Scottish banknotes. The Jersey notes are not legal tender in the United Kingdom but are legal currency, so creditors and traders may accept them if they so choose.  Question: is jersey currency legal tender in the uk  Explain your choice.	No, Jersey currency is not legal tender in the UK. The passage states that "Jersey notes are not legal tender in the United Kingdom", indicating that they are not widely accepted as payment in the UK, unlike in Jersey.
1760474303	1760474304	Passage: Milwaukee Bucks -- The Bucks have won one league title (1971), two conference titles (1971 and 1974), and 13 division titles (1971--1974, 1976, 1980--1986, 2001). They have featured such notable players as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Sidney Moncrief, Oscar Robertson, Bob Dandridge, Bob Lanier, Glenn Robinson, Ray Allen, Sam Cassell, Junior Bridgeman, Michael Redd, Terry Cummings, Vin Baker, Jon McGlocklin, Marques Johnson, and Brian Winters.  Question: have the milwaukee bucks ever won a championship  Explain your choice.	Yes, the Milwaukee Bucks have won a championship.  According to the passage, the Bucks won the league title in 1971.
1760474304	1760474304	Passage: List of FIFA World Cup penalty shoot-outs -- This is a list of all penalty shoot-outs that have occurred in the Finals tournament of the FIFA World Cup. Penalty shoot-outs were introduced as tie-breakers in the 1978 World Cup but did not occur before 1982. The first time a World Cup title was won by penalty shoot-out was in 1994. The only other time was in 2006. By the end of the 2018 edition, 30 shoot-outs have taken place in the World Cup. Of these, only two reached the sudden death stage after still being tied at the end of ``best of five kicks''.  Question: does the world cup final go to penalties  Explain your choice.	No, the World Cup final does not always go to penalties. According to the passage, penalty shoot-outs were introduced as tie-breakers in the 1978 World Cup, but the first time a World Cup title was won by penalty shoot-out was in 1994, and the only other time was in 2006. This implies that not all World Cup finals have been decided by penalty shoot-outs, as there are at least two finals that were decided by other means (i.e., goals scored during regular play).
1760474304	1760474306	Passage: Kingdom (manga) -- Kingdom (キングダム, Kingudamu) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yasuhisa Hara (原泰久, Hara Yasuhisa). The manga provides a fictionalized account of the Warring States period primarily through the experiences of the war orphan Xin and his comrades as he fights to become the greatest general under the heavens, and in doing so, unifying China for the first time in history. The series was adapted into a thirty-eight episode anime series by studio Pierrot that aired from June 4, 2012 to February 25, 2013. A second season was announced and aired from June 8, 2013 to March 1, 2014. An English language release of the anime was licensed by Funimation.  Question: is kingdom manga based on a true story  Explain your choice.	No, Kingdom manga is not based on a true story. The passage states that it is a "fictionalized account" of the Warring States period, which suggests that the events and characters in the manga are not based on actual historical events or people. While the manga may draw inspiration from real historical events and figures, it is not a historically accurate depiction of the Warring States period.  The passage also mentions that the main character, Xin, is a war orphan, which is a common trope in fiction, and that he fights to become the greatest general under the heavens and unify China for the first time in history. These elements are typical of fantasy and historical fiction stories, rather than historical nonfiction.  Overall, while the Kingdom manga may be loosely based on historical events and figures, it is a work of fiction rather than a true account of the past.
1760474306	1760474306	Passage: European Economic Area -- As of 2014 the contracting parties to the EEA are 3 of the 4 EFTA member states and 27 of the 28 EU member states. The 28th and newest EU member, Croatia, finished negotiating their accession to the EEA in November 2013, and since 12 April 2014 is provisionally applying the agreement pending its ratification by all EEA member states.  Question: is croatia part of the european economic area  Explain your choice.	Yes, Croatia is part of the European Economic Area (EEA).  According to the passage, Croatia finished negotiating their accession to the EEA in November 2013, and since April 12, 2014, they have provisionally applied the agreement pending its ratification by all EEA member states. This indicates that Croatia is currently a part of the EEA, even though their accession is still pending ratification.
1760474306	1760474308	Passage: Posthumous marriage -- Posthumous marriage (or necrogamy) is a marriage in which one of the participating members is deceased. It is legal in France and similar forms are practiced in Sudan and China. Since World War I, France has had hundreds of requests each year, of which many have been accepted.  Question: can u marry a dead person in france  Explain your choice.	Yes, it is technically possible to marry a dead person in France, but it's not a straightforward process. According to the passage, posthumous marriage (also known as necrogamy) is legal in France.  However, it's worth noting that this type of marriage requires specific circumstances and is not a common practice. The passage mentions that France receives hundreds of requests for posthumous marriage each year, and many of them are accepted.  To get married to a deceased person in France, the surviving partner would typically need to meet certain conditions, such as:  1. The deceased person had not been officially declared dead by the authorities. 2. The surviving partner had not remarried before the death of the deceased. 3. The surviving partner is of sound mind and free from any mental incapacity.  It's also worth noting that the laws and regulations surrounding posthumous marriage can be complex and may vary depending on the specific circumstances of the case.  In summary, while it is possible to marry a dead person in France, it requires specific conditions to be met and is not a common practice.
1760474308	1760474310	Passage: Saline (medicine) -- Saline, also known as saline solution, is a mixture of sodium chloride in water and has a number of uses in medicine. Applied to the affected area it is used to clean wounds, help remove contact lenses, and help with dry eyes. By injection into a vein it is used to treat dehydration such as from gastroenteritis and diabetic ketoacidosis. It is also used to dilute other medications to be given by injection.  Question: is saline and sodium chloride the same thing  Explain your choice.	While related, saline and sodium chloride are not exactly the same thing.  Sodium chloride is the chemical name for table salt (NaCl), a compound composed of sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) elements.  Saline, on the other hand, is a solution that contains sodium chloride dissolved in water. In other words, saline is a mixture of sodium chloride (the compound) in water.  In the passage, the term "saline" is often used to refer to a solution of sodium chloride in water, which is used in medical applications. So, in this context, "saline" and "sodium chloride" are interchangeable terms, as they both refer to the same solution.  However, in a more technical sense, sodium chloride is the actual compound, while saline is the solution that contains that compound.
1760474310	1760474311	Passage: Bubonic plague -- Several classes of antibiotics are effective in treating bubonic plague. These include aminoglycosides such as streptomycin and gentamicin, tetracyclines (especially doxycycline), and the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. Mortality associated with treated cases of bubonic plague is about 1--15%, compared to a mortality of 40--60% in untreated cases.  Question: is there a treatment for the bubonic plague  Explain your choice.	Yes, there are treatments available for the bubonic plague. The passage specifically mentions several classes of antibiotics that are effective in treating bubonic plague, including:  1. Aminoglycosides (e.g. streptomycin and gentamicin) 2. Tetracyclines (especially doxycycline) 3. Fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin)  These antibiotics can significantly reduce the mortality rate associated with bubonic plague, which is around 1-15% when treated, compared to 40-60% in untreated cases.
1760474311	1760474311	Passage: Joyce Summers -- The premise of the series is that Buffy is the latest Slayer, a young woman endowed by mystical forces with superhuman powers to fight and defeat vampires, demons, and other evil forces in the fictional town of Sunnydale. Like every Slayer before her, she was chosen and informed of her destiny when she was 15 years old. Her mother is unaware of her daughter's powers and responsibilities until Buffy is forced to tell her at the end of the second season of the television series. Although Joyce is shocked at this revelation, she recovers quickly and remains a source of stability for Buffy and Buffy's small circle of friends who assist her, dubbed the Scooby Gang. Eventually Joyce is able to take Buffy's dangerous demon-fighting in stride and even become proud and respectful of her daughter's abilities. Her natural death from an illness in the fifth season forces Buffy to face becoming an adult.  Question: does buffy's mom know she's a slayer  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, no, Buffy's mom, Joyce, does not know she's a Slayer initially. The passage states: "Her mother is unaware of her daughter's powers and responsibilities until Buffy is forced to tell her at the end of the second season of the television series." However, it is later mentioned that Joyce "recovers quickly" after learning the truth and becomes a supportive source for Buffy.
1760474311	1760474312	Passage: Leaning Tower of Pisa -- The tower's tilt began during construction in the 12th century, caused by an inadequate foundation on ground too soft on one side to properly support the structure's weight. The tilt increased in the decades before the structure was completed in the 14th century. It gradually increased until the structure was stabilized (and the tilt partially corrected) by efforts in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.  Question: was the leaning tower of pisa built leaning  Explain your choice.	No, the Leaning Tower of Pisa was not built leaning.  According to the passage, the tower's tilt began during construction in the 12th century, which means it was intended to be straight. The tilt occurred due to an inadequate foundation, and it was not a deliberate design choice. The tower was not built with a noticeable lean. The tilt developed over time due to the soft ground, and it was later stabilized and partially corrected in the 20th and 21st centuries.
1760474312	1760474314	Passage: Fool's Gold (2008 film) -- Fool's Gold is a 2008 American adventure-romance film from Warner Bros. Pictures about a recently divorced couple who rekindle their romantic life while searching for a lost treasure. The film was directed by Andy Tennant and reunites the How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days stars Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson.  Question: is the movie fool's gold a true story  Explain your choice.	No, the movie "Fool's Gold" (2008) is not a true story. While it features a romantic adventure plot involving a lost treasure, the story itself is fictional. The film is a work of entertainment created by screenwriters Ted Griffin, Dennis Storhøi, and Dan Fogelman, and it is not based on actual events or people.  The movie's plot, which involves a recently divorced couple rekindling their romance while searching for a lost treasure, is a fictional narrative. The film's stars, Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson, play characters that are not based on real individuals. The movie's storyline is meant to be an entertaining and engaging story, rather than a biographical or historical account.  It's worth noting that the title "Fool's Gold" is a phrase that refers to a term used in the mining industry to describe a type of ore that is often mistaken for gold, but is actually worthless. This phrase is used in the movie as a metaphor for the idea that the characters are chasing after something that may not be what they think it is.
1760474314	1760474315	Passage: Super Bowl curse -- The home field curse affects the host team of the Super Bowl. So far no team has yet managed to reach the Super Bowl in their home stadium. Four teams with Super Bowls in their home venue have qualified for the divisional playoffs: the 1994 Miami Dolphins, the 1998 Miami Dolphins, the 2016 Houston Texans, and the 2017 Minnesota Vikings, the Vikings being the first to qualify for their conference's title game. From 1966--2011 (excluding the six Super Bowl games held in a stadium without a professional team), the Super Bowl host team has had 11 winning seasons, four split seasons, and 25 losing seasons. Mathematically, the probability of that many losing seasons or more occurring by chance (assuming a 50 percent chance of having a losing season (disregarding .500 seasons)) is 7.69 percent. It should be noted, however, that the Super Bowl host stadium is selected several years before the game is played, without regard to the teams that qualify.  Question: has any nfl team played the superbowl at home  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, no team has yet managed to reach the Super Bowl in their home stadium. However, it is mentioned that the 1994 Miami Dolphins, the 1998 Miami Dolphins, the 2016 Houston Texans, and the 2017 Minnesota Vikings have qualified for the divisional playoffs in their home venue, which implies that they have played in the playoffs in their home stadium.  However, the passage specifically states that no team has yet managed to reach the Super Bowl in their home stadium. Since the Super Bowl is the championship game of the NFL playoffs, and the teams mentioned in the passage have only reached the divisional playoffs, it can be inferred that none of these teams have played in the Super Bowl in their home stadium.  Therefore, the answer is no, no NFL team has played the Super Bowl at home.
1760474315	1760474316	Passage: State constitution (Australia) -- In Australia, each state has its own constitution. Each state constitution preceded the Constitution of Australia as constitutions of the then separate British colonies, but all the states ceded powers to the Parliament of Australia as part of federation in 1901.  Question: does each australian state have its own constitution  Explain your choice.	Yes, according to the passage, each Australian state has its own constitution. The passage states: "each state has its own constitution" (emphasis mine). This suggests that each of the six states in Australia (New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania, and also the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory, which are also self-governing states) has its own constitution, which was established before the creation of the Australian Constitution in 1901.
1760474316	1760474319	Passage: Bundle branch block -- A bundle branch block can be diagnosed when the duration of the QRS complex on the ECG exceeds 120 ms. A right bundle branch block typically causes prolongation of the last part of the QRS complex, and may shift the heart's electrical axis slightly to the right. The ECG will show a terminal R wave in lead V1 and a slurred S wave in lead I. Left bundle branch block widens the entire QRS, and in most cases shifts the heart's electrical axis to the left. The ECG will show a QS or rS complex in lead V1 and a monophasic R wave in lead I. Another normal finding with bundle branch block is appropriate T wave discordance. In other words, the T wave will be deflected opposite the terminal deflection of the QRS complex. Bundle branch block, especially left bundle branch block, can lead to cardiac dyssynchrony. The simultaneous occurrence of left and right bundle branch block leads to total AV block.  Question: can you have a right and left bundle branch block  Explain your choice.	Yes, it is possible to have both a right bundle branch block (RBB) and a left bundle branch block (LBB) simultaneously.  Bundle branch blocks are usually classified into three types:  1. Left bundle branch block (LBB): This is the most common type, where the electrical impulse to the left ventricle is delayed, causing a widened QRS complex. 2. Right bundle branch block (RBB): This is a less common type, where the electrical impulse to the right ventricle is delayed, causing a widened QRS complex with a terminal R wave in lead V1 and a slurred S wave in lead I. 3. Complete heart block: This is a combination of both LBB and RBB, where both bundle branches are completely blocked, resulting in a total AV block.  In some cases, a person can have a combination of RBB and LBB, which is known as a "combined bundle branch block" or "bundle branch block with complete heart block". This occurs when there is a blockage or delay in both bundle branches, leading to a widened QRS complex and a complex ECG pattern.  The ECG findings for a combined bundle branch block would include:  * A widened QRS complex (>120 ms) * A terminal R wave in lead V1 * A slurred S wave in lead I * A QS or rS complex in lead V1 * A monophasic R wave in lead I * T wave discordance (opposite deflection of the T wave to the terminal deflection of the QRS complex)  It's worth noting that a combined bundle branch block is a relatively rare condition, and a thorough ECG evaluation is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
1760474319	1760474321	Passage: Check (chess) -- In informal games, it is customary to announce ``check'' when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check. In formal competitions, however, check is rarely announced.  Question: do you always have to say check in chess  Explain your choice.	No, you do not always have to say "check" in chess.  In informal games, it is indeed customary to announce "check" when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check, as it serves as a way to alert the opponent to the potential threat.  However, in formal competitions, check is rarely announced. This is because in formal chess, the rules require the player who is in check to make their move immediately, and announcing "check" is not necessary. The opponent can simply respond to the check without needing to be notified.  In fact, the Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE), the governing body of chess worldwide, does not require players to announce "check" in official tournaments. The rules only specify that the player in check must make their move immediately, without requiring them to say "check" out loud.  Therefore, in formal chess, it is not necessary to say "check" to announce a check, as the rules of the game already require the player to respond to the threat.
1760474321	1760474322	Passage: Australian Cattle Dog -- The Texas Heeler is a cross between the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Shepherd that was first registered with the Animal Research Foundation (ARF) in 1970. The ARF has registered Australian Cattle Dogs without papers as ``Australian Cattledog Queensland Heelers'' since 1965 and was the first organisation to recognise the Australian Shepherd. Although originally bred for its ability to work cattle, the Texas Heeler is increasingly used as a pet and a companion in dog sports. As with most cross breeds, the Texas Heeler's size and appearance is a variable combination of the parent breeds.  Question: is an australian shepherd the same as an australian cattle dog  Explain your choice.	No, an Australian Shepherd is not the same as an Australian Cattle Dog. Although the Texas Heeler is a cross between the two breeds, the question is asking if an Australian Shepherd is the same as an Australian Cattle Dog.  The passage states that the Texas Heeler is a cross between the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Shepherd. This implies that the two breeds are distinct and separate.  The Australian Cattle Dog is a purebred breed, while the Australian Shepherd is also a purebred breed. They are two different breeds with their own unique characteristics, origins, and histories.  Therefore, an Australian Shepherd is not the same as an Australian Cattle Dog.
1760474322	1760474323	Passage: Tomato purée -- Tomato purée is a thick liquid made by cooking and straining tomatoes. The difference between tomato paste, tomato purée, and tomato sauce is consistency; tomato puree has a thicker consistency and a deeper flavour than sauce.  Question: is tomato puree and tomato sauce the same thing  Explain your choice.	No, tomato puree and tomato sauce are not the same thing. The main difference between the two is the consistency and flavor.  Tomato sauce is a thinner liquid, often used as a base for many sauces, soups, and stews. It's usually made by cooking down fresh or canned tomatoes with some aromatics and seasonings. Tomato sauce is thinner and more watery than tomato puree.  Tomato puree, on the other hand, is a thicker, more concentrated liquid made by cooking and straining tomatoes, as mentioned in the passage. It has a deeper flavor and a thicker consistency than tomato sauce.  In summary, while both tomato puree and tomato sauce are made from tomatoes, the main difference lies in their consistency and flavor, with tomato puree being thicker and more concentrated than tomato sauce.
1760474323	1760474324	Passage: The Blues Brothers -- The Blues Brothers are an American blues and soul revivalist band which was founded in 1978 by comedy actors Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi as part of a musical sketch on Saturday Night Live. Belushi and Aykroyd fronted the band, respectively in character as lead vocalist ``Joliet'' Jake Blues and harmonica player/vocalist Elwood Blues. The band was composed of well-known and respected musicians, and debuted as the musical guest on the April 22, 1978, episode of Saturday Night Live, opening the show performing ``Hey Bartender'', and later ``Soul Man''.  Question: is the blues brothers based on a true story  Explain your choice.	No, the Blues Brothers are not based on a true story. The passage states that the band was founded by comedy actors Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi as part of a musical sketch on Saturday Night Live, which suggests that the story is fictional. The Blues Brothers were created as a humorous concept for the sketch, and not based on a real-life blues band or individuals.
1760474324	1760474325	Passage: Newcastle upon Tyne -- Newcastle upon Tyne (locally /njuːˈkæsəl/ ( listen)), commonly known as Newcastle, is a city in Tyne and Wear, North East England, 103 miles (166 km) south of Edinburgh and 277 miles (446 km) north of London on the northern bank of the River Tyne, 8.5 mi (13.7 km) from the North Sea. Newcastle is the most populous city in the North East, and forms the core of the Tyneside conurbation, the eighth most populous urban area in the United Kingdom. Newcastle is a member of the English Core Cities Group and is a member of the Eurocities network of European cities.  Question: is newcastle upon tyne the same as newcastle  Explain your choice.	No, Newcastle upon Tyne and Newcastle are not the same. The difference lies in the "upon" and the "upon Tyne" part.  "Newcastle upon Tyne" is the full official name of the city, which includes the phrase "upon Tyne". This is a preposition indicating that the city is located on the banks of the River Tyne. The "upon Tyne" part is essential to the city's official name.  On the other hand, "Newcastle" is a shortened form of the city's name, often used informally or in casual contexts. This name omits the "upon Tyne" part, which is not necessary for identification purposes.  So, while "Newcastle" can be used as a nickname or a shortened version of the city's name, "Newcastle upon Tyne" is the more formal and official name of the city.
1760474325	1760474326	Passage: Post Office Ltd -- The Post Office provides information on services and accepts postal items and payment on behalf of the two collection and delivery divisions of Royal Mail Group, Royal Mail and Parcelforce. These include a variety of ordinary and guaranteed services both for delivery within the United Kingdom and to international destinations. Postage stamps (including commemorative stamps and other philatelic items) are sold, while applications for redirection of mail are accepted on behalf of Royal Mail.  Question: is post office and royal mail the same  Explain your choice.	No, Post Office Ltd and Royal Mail are not the same, although they are closely related.  Royal Mail is a trading subsidiary of the UK government, responsible for providing postal services in the United Kingdom. It operates the collection, sorting, and delivery of mail and parcels.  Post Office Ltd, on the other hand, is a separate company that operates a network of post offices across the UK. While Post Office Ltd is often associated with Royal Mail, it provides a range of financial services, such as banking, bill payments, and money transfers, in addition to accepting mail and providing other services like passport photos and travel money.  In other words, Royal Mail is the postal service, while Post Office Ltd is the retail brand that operates the post offices where people can collect, send, and receive mail, as well as access other services.
1760474326	1760474327	Passage: Unsuccessful nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States -- Justices are nominated by the president and then confirmed by the U.S. Senate. A nomination to the Court is considered to be official when the Senate receives a signed nomination letter from the president naming the nominee, which is then entered in the Senate's record. There have been 37 unsuccessful nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States. Of these, 11 nominees were rejected in Senate roll-call votes, 11 were withdrawn by the president, and 15 lapsed at the end of a session of Congress. Six of these unsuccessful nominees were subsequently nominated and confirmed to other seats on the Court. Additionally, although confirmed, seven nominees either declined office or (in one instance) died before assuming office.  Question: has any supreme court nominee not been confirmed  Explain your choice.	Yes, according to the passage, seven Supreme Court nominees were confirmed but either declined office or died before assuming office.
1760474327	1760474327	Passage: Thanksgiving (United States) -- Thanksgiving, or Thanksgiving Day, is a public holiday celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States. It originated as a harvest festival. Thanksgiving has been celebrated nationally on and off since 1789, after Congress requested a proclamation by George Washington. It has been celebrated as a federal holiday every year since 1863, when, during the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a national day of ``Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens,'' to be celebrated on the last Thursday in November. Together with Christmas and the New Year, Thanksgiving is a part of the broader fall/winter holiday season in the U.S.  Question: is thanksgiving always the last thursday of the month  Explain your choice.	No, Thanksgiving is not always the last Thursday of the month. According to the passage, it is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. This means that the date of Thanksgiving can vary from year to year, and it can fall on any Thursday between the 22nd and the 28th of November.
1760474327	1760474328	Passage: The Lord of the Rings -- The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J.R.R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.  Question: is lord of the rings after the hobbit  Explain your choice.	Yes, "The Lord of the Rings" is the sequel to "The Hobbit". According to the passage, "The Lord of the Rings" "began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit". This indicates that "The Lord of the Rings" was originally intended to be a continuation of the story of "The Hobbit", and not a completely new story.
1760474328	1760474329	Passage: Fallen (2016 film) -- In December 2014, it was announced that Torment, the second installment in the Fallen book series, was in development. It is unknown whether the last two novels, Passion and Rapture, and the spin-off novel, Unforgiven, will be adapted as well. In 2017, producer Kevan Van Thompson asked the fans if they want an adaptation of ``Torment'', showing that the sequel still could be made.  Question: is the fallen movie going to have a sequel  Explain your choice.	The passage does not directly state that the Fallen movie is going to have a sequel. However, it does mention that the second installment in the Fallen book series, "Torment", is in development, and that the last two novels, "Passion" and "Rapture", and the spin-off novel, "Unforgiven", may also be adapted. This suggests that a sequel to the Fallen movie is possible, but it is not confirmed.
1760474329	1760474329	Passage: List of most-followed Instagram accounts -- This list contains the top 50 accounts with the most followers on the social photo-sharing platform Instagram. As of October 2018, the most followed user is Instagram's own account, with over 260 million followers. Cristiano Ronaldo is the most followed individual, with over 144 million followers. Twelve accounts have exceeded 100 million followers on the site.  Question: does anyone on instagram have 1 billion followers  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, it does not mention anyone having 1 billion followers on Instagram. The passage mentions that as of October 2018, the most followed user is Instagram's own account, with over 260 million followers, and Cristiano Ronaldo has over 144 million followers. However, it does not mention anyone with 1 billion followers.
1760474329	1760474329	Passage: Padmé Amidala -- George Lucas, Rick McCallum, and casting director Robin Gurland auditioned over 200 actresses for the part of Padmé Amidala. They chose 16-year-old actress Natalie Portman to play the role. According to The Phantom Menace production notes, ``The role required a young woman who could be believable as the ruler of that planet, but at the same time be vulnerable and open.'' Portman's performances in The Professional (1994) and Beautiful Girls (1996) impressed Lucas. He stated, ``I was looking for someone who was young, strong, along the lines of Leia. Natalie embodied all those traits and more.''  Question: in the phantom menace is padme the queen  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, Padmé Amidala is not the queen in The Phantom Menace, but rather the queen of the planet Naboo.
1760474329	1760474332	Passage: The Lord of the Rings -- The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J.R.R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.  Question: is lord of the rings considered an epic  Explain your choice.	Yes, "The Lord of the Rings" is considered an epic.  An epic is a long narrative poem or novel that typically features heroic characters, quests, and a grand, elevated tone. It often explores themes of good vs. evil, friendship, and personal growth, and typically has a significant historical or mythological context.  In "The Lord of the Rings," we see many elements that align with the characteristics of an epic:  1. **Heroic quest**: The story follows a group of heroes, including Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gandalf, as they embark on a perilous journey to destroy the One Ring and save Middle-earth from the dark lord Sauron. 2. **Elevated tone**: The novel is written in a formal, descriptive style, with detailed descriptions of landscapes, characters, and events, which creates a sense of grandeur and importance. 3. **Historical/mythological context**: The novel is set in Middle-earth, a richly detailed world created by Tolkien, with its own history, cultures, and mythology. 4. **Themes of good vs. evil**: The struggle between the free peoples of Middle-earth and the dark forces of Sauron represents a classic epic struggle between good and evil. 5. **Length and scope**: The novel is a long and complex work, spanning multiple books and thousands of pages, which is typical of epic literature.  Overall, "The Lord of the Rings" meets many of the criteria that define epic literature, making it a quintessential epic novel.
1760474332	1760474332	Passage: Euro sign -- The euro sign (€) is the currency sign used for the euro, the official currency of the Eurozone in the European Union (EU). The design was presented to the public by the European Commission on 12 December 1996. The international three-letter code (according to ISO standard ISO 4217) for the euro is EUR. In Unicode it is encoded at U+20AC € euro sign (HTML &#8364; &euro; ). In English, the sign precedes the value (for instance, €10, not 10 €, unlike most other European languages). In some style guides, but not others, the euro sign is unspaced.  Question: does the euro sign go before the number  Explain your choice.	Yes, according to the passage, the euro sign does go before the number. The passage states: "In English, the sign precedes the value (for instance, €10, not 10 €)". This indicates that in English, the euro sign is placed before the number, not after it.
1760474332	1760474334	Passage: Induction cooking -- For nearly all models of induction cooktops, a cooking vessel must be made of, or contain, a ferrous metal such as cast iron or some stainless steels. The iron in the pot concentrates the current to produce heat in the metal. If the metal is too thin, or does not provide enough resistance to current flow, heating will not be effective. Most induction tops will not heat copper or aluminum vessels because the magnetic field cannot produce a concentrated current; ``all metal'' induction tops use much higher frequencies to overcome that effect. Any vessel can be used if placed on a suitable metal disk which functions as a conventional hotplate.  Question: can stainless steel be used on induction cooktop  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, stainless steel can be used on an induction cooktop, but with some limitations. The passage states that "some stainless steels" can be used, implying that not all stainless steels are suitable for induction cooking.  The reason for this is that the magnetic field generated by the induction cooktop needs to be able to concentrate the current to produce heat in the metal. If the metal is too thin or does not provide enough resistance to current flow, heating will not be effective.  It is likely that some stainless steels have a higher resistance to current flow than others, which is why some can be used on induction cooktops, while others may not be suitable.
1760474334	1760474335	Passage: Dismissal (employment) -- ``Firing'' is a common colloquial term in the English language (particularly used in the U.S.) for termination. The term ``firing'' may have been initiated in the 1910s at the National Cash Register Company. Other terms for dismissal are being ``sacked'', ``canned'', ``let go'', ``ran-off'', ``axed'', ``given walking papers'', ``given the pink slip'' or ``boned''. Other terms, more often used in Commonwealth countries, include ``to get the boot'' and ``to get the sack''.  Question: is job termination the same as being fired  Explain your choice.	No, job termination and being fired are not exactly the same, although the terms are often used interchangeably.  Job termination refers to the formal process of ending an employee's employment relationship with an organization. It can be due to various reasons such as poor performance, misconduct, downsizing, or restructuring. Job termination typically involves a formal process, including notice, severance packages, and sometimes legal procedures.  Being fired, on the other hand, is a more colloquial term that refers to the act of being dismissed from a job without necessarily following the formal process of job termination. It can be used in both formal and informal settings, and it may not always involve a formal severance package or notice period.  In other words, job termination is a more formal process, while being fired is a more casual term that may not necessarily involve the same level of formality or procedure.
1760474335	1760474336	Passage: Inattentional blindness -- In a 2015 study, Cary Stothart, Walter Boot, and Daniel Simons attempted to replicate and extend the findings from both Graham and Burke's 2011 study and Steven Most and colleague's 2000 study on Amazon Mechanical Turk using a sample of 515 participants that varied in age. In this study, participants were tasked with counting the number of times a number of white moving objects crossed the vertical midpoint of a display while ignoring a number of black moving objects. The unexpected object in this case was a gray cross that moved horizontally across the display at various distances from the vertical midpoint (this was manipulated between participants). Overall, they found that inattentional blindness susceptibility increases with age, which replicates the finding from Graham and Burke. In fact, they found that every 10 years of age was associated with a 1.3 fold increase in the probability of displaying inattentional blindness. They also found that the probability of inattentional blindness increases as the distance between the observer's focus of attention and the unexpected object increases, which replicates the finding from Most and colleagues. However, they also found that the relationship that age has with inattentional blindness does not change as a function of the unexpected object's distance from the focus of attention, suggesting that useful field of view does not mediate the relationship between age and inattentional blindness.  Question: does age have any influence on attentional ability or inattentional blindness  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, it appears that age does have an influence on attentional ability and inattentional blindness. The study found that:  1. Inattentional blindness susceptibility increases with age, specifically with every 10 years of age, resulting in a 1.3 fold increase in the probability of displaying inattentional blindness.  This suggests that older individuals are more prone to inattentional blindness, which is a type of cognitive bias where individuals fail to notice a stimulus that is in their peripheral vision.  Therefore, the answer to the question is yes, age has an influence on attentional ability and inattentional blindness.
1760474336	1760474339	Passage: Sanskrit -- Sanskrit belongs to the Indo-European family of languages. It is one of the three ancient documented languages that likely arose from a common root language now referred to as the Proto-Indo-European language:  Question: is sanskrit the first language of the world  Explain your choice.	No, Sanskrit is not the first language of the world. While it is one of the oldest documented languages, it is not the oldest language in the sense that it was the first language spoken by humans.  The concept of a single "first language" is a subject of debate among linguists, as it is difficult to determine the earliest languages that were spoken by our ancestors. However, most scholars agree that the Proto-Indo-European language, also known as Proto-Indo-Iranian, is the most likely candidate for the earliest known ancestor of many European and Asian languages, including Sanskrit.  The Proto-Indo-European language is thought to have been spoken around 4000-3000 BCE, and it is believed to have been the common language of a group of people who migrated from the Eurasian steppes to various parts of Europe and Asia. Over time, this language evolved into different dialects and eventually gave rise to the various languages we know today, including Sanskrit.  Sanskrit, on the other hand, is a member of the Indo-Aryan branch of the Indo-European language family, and it emerged around 1500-1000 BCE. It was the language of ancient India and was used as a liturgical language for many centuries. While it is an ancient language, it is not the oldest language, but rather a descendant of the Proto-Indo-European language.  In summary, while Sanskrit is an ancient and significant language, it is not the first language of the world. That distinction belongs to the Proto-Indo-European language, which is the hypothetical ancestor of many languages, including Sanskrit.
1760474339	1760474339	Passage: Jack Russell Terrier -- The Jack Russell Terrier is a small terrier that has its origins in fox hunting. It is principally white-bodied and smooth, rough or broken-coated but can be any colour.  Question: is a jack russell considered a small breed  Explain your choice.	Yes, a Jack Russell Terrier is considered a small breed. According to the general classification of dog breeds, a Jack Russell Terrier typically weighs between 13-17 pounds (6-7.7 kg) and stands between 10-15 inches (25-38 cm) tall at the shoulder. These dimensions place it firmly within the "small" category of dog breeds.
1760474339	1760474340	Passage: Air Force One -- The Air Force usually does not have fighter aircraft escort the presidential aircraft over the United States but it has occurred, for example during the attack on the World Trade Center.  Question: does air force one travel with fighter escort  Explain your choice.	No, the Air Force does not typically provide fighter escort for Air Force One when it travels over the United States.   Although the Air Force has escorted Air Force One on rare occasions, such as during the 9/11 attacks, this is not a standard practice.   Air Force One's primary security is typically handled by the Secret Service, and the plane is escorted by fighter aircraft only in extraordinary circumstances, such as a national security threat.   In general, Air Force One travels with a standard escort of F-15 or F-16 fighter jets when it enters restricted airspace, but this is not a routine occurrence and is usually done in conjunction with other security measures.
1760474340	1760474342	Passage: AR-15s in California -- The Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989 banned Colt AR-15 rifles by name in the State of California. California's 2000 Assault Weapons ban went further and banned AR-15s made by other manufacturers by name such as Bushmaster, PWA, and Olympic Arms.  Question: is it legal to own an ar15 in california  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, it appears that it is not entirely clear-cut whether it is legal to own an AR-15 in California. The passage states that the Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989 banned Colt AR-15 rifles by name in California. However, it does not explicitly state that AR-15s made by other manufacturers, such as Bushmaster, PWA, and Olympic Arms, are also banned.  In fact, the passage suggests that California's 2000 Assault Weapons ban went further and banned AR-15s made by other manufacturers by name, implying that the ban is not just limited to Colt-made AR-15s. However, it does not provide clear guidance on whether AR-15s made by other manufacturers, such as Bushmaster, PWA, and Olympic Arms, are still allowed.  Therefore, based on the passage, it is not possible to conclude with certainty whether it is legal to own an AR-15 in California. It is likely that the law is more complex and that there may be specific regulations or exemptions that apply to certain types of AR-15s.
1760474342	1760474344	Passage: The Star-Spangled Banner -- ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' is the national anthem of the United States. The lyrics come from ``Defence of Fort M'Henry'', a poem written on September 14, 1814, by the then 35-year-old lawyer and amateur poet Francis Scott Key after witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry by British ships of the Royal Navy in Baltimore Harbor during the Battle of Baltimore in the War of 1812. Key was inspired by the large U.S. flag, with 15 stars and 15 stripes, known as the Star-Spangled Banner, flying triumphantly above the fort during the U.S. victory.  Question: is the national anthem and star spangled banner the same  Explain your choice.	No, the "Star-Spangled Banner" and "The Star-Spangled Banner" are not exactly the same thing.  "The Star-Spangled Banner" refers to the national anthem of the United States, which is the song that is played during official events and ceremonies. The national anthem is the official song of the United States.  On the other hand, "The Star-Spangled Banner" refers to the poem that inspired the national anthem. The poem was written by Francis Scott Key in 1814, and it describes the bombardment of Fort McHenry by British ships during the War of 1812. The poem is often referred to as "Defence of Fort M'Henry".  So, while "The Star-Spangled Banner" is the name of the poem, "The Star-Spangled Banner" is the name of the national anthem, which was written based on that poem.
1760474344	1760474344	Passage: Naples International Airport -- Naples International Airport (IATA: NAP, ICAO: LIRN) (Italian: Aeroporto Internazionale di Napoli) is the international airport serving Naples, Italy. It is located 3.2 NM (5.9 km; 3.7 mi) north-northeast of the city in the Capodichino district of Naples. The airport has two terminal buildings: Terminal 1 is for scheduled flights and Terminal 2, located away from the airfield, is used for charter operations.  Question: is there an international airport in naples italy  Explain your choice.	Yes, there is an international airport in Naples, Italy.  The passage states: "Naples International Airport -- Naples International Airport (IATA: NAP, ICAO: LIRN)" explicitly indicates that Naples has an international airport. Additionally, the fact that it mentions specific details such as its location, terminal buildings, and operational information (scheduled flights and charter operations) further supports this conclusion.
1760474344	1760474345	Passage: Cadbury Creme Egg -- Creme eggs are available annually between 1 January and Easter Day. In the UK in the 1980s, Cadbury made Creme Eggs available year-round but sales dropped and they returned to seasonal availability.  Question: can you buy cadburys creme eggs all year round  Explain your choice.	No, you cannot buy Cadbury Creme Eggs all year round in the UK. According to the passage, Cadbury Creme Eggs were once available year-round in the UK in the 1980s, but due to declining sales, they were returned to seasonal availability, which is between January 1st and Easter Day.
1760474345	1760474347	Passage: Homologous chromosome -- A couple of homologous chromosomes, or homologs, are a set of one maternal and one paternal chromosome that pair up with each other inside a cell during meiosis. Homologs have the same genes in the same loci where they provide points along each chromosome which enable a pair of chromosomes to align correctly with each other before separating during meiosis. This is the basis for Mendelian inheritance which characterizes inheritance patterns of genetic material from an organism to its offspring parent developmental cell at the given time and area.  Question: do homologous chromosomes carry information for the same traits  Explain your choice.	Yes, homologous chromosomes carry information for the same traits.  Here's why:  1. Homologous chromosomes are a pair of chromosomes that come from different parents, but they have the same genes in the same loci. This means they carry the same genetic information. 2. These chromosomes are located at the same position on the same chromosome arm (homologous arms) and are arranged in a specific order (linearly arranged). 3. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair up with each other, which allows for the exchange of genetic material between them. This exchange of genetic material helps to shufﬁle genetic information and increase genetic diversity. 4. The genetic information on homologous chromosomes is used to determine the traits of the offspring. Since they carry the same genes in the same loci, they will contribute the same alleles (different forms of a gene) to the offspring, resulting in the same trait.  For example, if one homologous chromosome carries the allele for brown eyes (B) and the other carries the allele for blue eyes (b), the offspring will inherit one allele for brown eyes and one allele for blue eyes, resulting in brown eyes.  In summary, homologous chromosomes carry the same genetic information for a particular trait, and their combination during meiosis determines the traits of the offspring.
1760474347	1760474347	Passage: Michigan Wolverines football -- Michigan began competing in intercollegiate football in 1879. The Wolverines joined the Big Ten Conference at its inception in 1896, and other than a hiatus from 1907 to 1916, have been members since. Michigan has won or shared 42 league titles, and, since the inception of the AP Poll in 1936, has finished in the top 10 a total of 38 times. The Wolverines claim 11 national championships, most recently that of the 1997 squad voted atop the final AP Poll.  Question: has michigan ever won a national championship in football  Explain your choice.	Yes, according to the passage, Michigan has won 11 national championships in football, with the most recent one being the 1997 season, as voted by the AP Poll.
1760474347	1760474350	Passage: Waiter Rule -- The Waiter Rule refers to a common belief that one's true character can be gleaned from how one treats staff or service workers, such as a ``waiter''. The rule was one of William H Swanson's 33 Unwritten Rules of Management, copied from Dave Barry's version ``If someone is nice to you but rude to the waiter, they are not a nice person.''  Question: you can tell a lot about a person by how they treat their waiter  Explain your choice.	I disagree with the statement "you can tell a lot about a person by how they treat their waiter." This statement is based on the "Waiter Rule," a common belief that a person's true character can be determined by how they interact with service workers, such as waiters.  However, I would argue that this statement is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate. Treating a waiter poorly or nicely does not necessarily reveal a person's character or values. There are many reasons why someone might be rude or friendly to a waiter, and it's not always a reliable indicator of their character.  For example, someone who is having a bad day or is under a lot of stress might be short with their waiter, but that doesn't mean they are a bad person. Similarly, a person who is extremely polite and courteous to a waiter might be faking it or trying to make a good impression, rather than genuinely being a kind and compassionate person.  Additionally, people can change their behavior in different situations, and a person's treatment of a waiter might not reflect their usual behavior in other areas of their life. Furthermore, the waiter's role is to provide service, not to judge or evaluate the customer's character.  In conclusion, while treating a waiter with respect and kindness is certainly important, it's not a definitive indicator of a person's character. Other factors, such as their actions and behavior in other situations, are more reliable in revealing their true nature.
1760474350	1760474352	Passage: American crocodile -- Within the United States, the American crocodile's distribution is limited to the southern tip of Florida, though at least two have been found as far north as the Tampa Bay area. The current US population, estimated at 2,000, represents a significant recovery from a few hundred in the 1970s.  Question: are there any crocodiles native to north america  Explain your choice.	Yes, there are crocodiles native to North America. The American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) is a species of crocodile that is native to the southeastern United States, specifically in the state of Florida, particularly in the southern tip and the Everglades region. Although its population has declined significantly due to habitat loss and hunting, conservation efforts have helped to recover it to an estimated 2,000 individuals.  There are no other species of crocodiles native to North America, but there are three species of crocodilians (including alligators and caimans) that are native to the Americas:  1. American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) 2. American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) 3. Morelet's crocodile (Crocodylus moreletii) 4. Spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus) 5. Broad-snouted caiman (Caiman latirostris)  These species are found in Central and South America, but not in North America.
1760474352	1760474352	Passage: Lex Luthor (Smallville) -- Season seven displayed Lex's descent into darkness; he has a brother-like relationship with Grant Gabriel (Michael Cassidy), the new editor of the Daily Planet newest editor, until it's revealed Grant is actually a clone of Lex's late brother. After Lex buys the Daily Planet, Grant attempts to keep Lex from being controlling, thus Lex has his brother's clone murdered and staged as a failed mugging. Lex then discovers that the previous symbols are connected to the secret organization Veritas, which his father is a part of. The Veritas members learned that an alien visitor known as ``The Traveler'' would arrive in Smallville during the meteor shower of 1989. At this time, Lex realizes that Lionel has been covering up the Traveler's existence and subsequently kills his own father for it. He eventually discovers that the Veritas members knew of a means to control the Traveler, so Lex sets out to find the device. The device, an orb he finds in the mantle above a fireplace in the Luthor mansion, leads Lex to the Fortress of Solitude, where he is confronted by Clark. Having finally discovered Clark's secret, Lex uses the orb to bring down the Fortress around Clark and himself.  Question: does lex luthor know who superman is in smallville  Explain your choice.	Yes, Lex Luthor knows that Superman is Clark Kent in Smallville.  The passage indicates that Lex Luthor discovers Clark's secret by using the orb, which leads him to the Fortress of Solitude, where he is confronted by Clark. This suggests that Lex has discovered Clark's true identity as Superman.
1760474352	1760474354	Passage: Admission to the bar in the United States -- In the canonical case, lawyers seeking admission must earn a Juris Doctor degree from a law school approved by the jurisdiction, and then pass a bar exam administered by it. Typically, there is also a character and fitness evaluation, which includes a background check. However, there are exceptions to each of these requirements. A lawyer who is admitted in one state is not automatically allowed to practice in any other. Some states have reciprocal agreements that allow attorneys from other states to practice without sitting for another full bar exam; such agreements differ significantly among the states.  Question: do you have to have a college degree to take the bar exam  Explain your choice.	No, you don't necessarily have to have a college degree to take the bar exam. While a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from an American Bar Association (ABA)-accredited law school is typically required for admission to the bar, it is not a requirement for taking the bar exam itself.  The bar exam is a professional licensing exam that tests a candidate's knowledge of the law and their ability to apply it, rather than their academic credentials. The exam is designed to assess a candidate's readiness to practice law, regardless of their educational background.  In fact, many law schools do not require a college degree for admission, and instead require applicants to have a certain number of credit hours or a specific combination of coursework, such as the LSAT (Law School Admission Test) score, to be considered for admission.  It's worth noting that some law schools may require a bachelor's degree for admission, but this is not a requirement for taking the bar exam. Ultimately, the specific requirements for taking the bar exam vary by state, so it's best to check with the bar exam authority in the state where you wish to practice law for more information.
1760474354	1760474356	Passage: Iron Fist (season 2) -- The second season of the American web television series Iron Fist, which is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, follows Danny Rand / Iron Fist, a martial arts expert with the ability to call upon the power of the Iron Fist. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films and other television series of the franchise. The season is produced by Marvel Television in association with ABC Studios, with Raven Metzner serving as showrunner.  Question: will there be a season 2 of marvel's iron fist  Explain your choice.	Unfortunately, there is no official confirmation of a season 2 of Marvel's Iron Fist. However, I can provide some context and possible reasons why it's unlikely:  1. **Cancellation**: In May 2018, it was announced that Marvel's Iron Fist had been cancelled after one season. The show was initially renewed for a second season, but it was later decided to cancel the series. 2. **Mixed reception**: The first season received mixed reviews from critics and audiences, with some praising the show's visuals and action sequences, while others criticized its storytelling, characters, and pacing. 3. **Lack of interest**: The cancellation of Iron Fist was reportedly due to a lack of interest from audiences and a desire to focus on other Marvel projects in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). 4. **Marvel's focus on other shows**: Since Iron Fist's cancellation, Marvel has focused on other projects, such as The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Loki, and Hawkeye, which have received more attention and investment.  While there have been rumors and fan requests for a revival or a spin-off, there has been no official confirmation from Marvel Studios or Netflix about a new season of Iron Fist.
1760474356	1760474357	Passage: Toll-free telephone numbers in the North American Numbering Plan -- In the United States of America, Canada, and other countries participating in the North American Numbering Plan, a toll-free telephone number has one of the area codes 800, 833, 844, 855, 866, 877, and 888.  Question: is 844 a toll free number in canada  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, it does not provide explicit information about the availability of the 844 area code as a toll-free number in Canada. However, we can make an educated guess.  In North America, the North American Numbering Plan was adopted in 1945 and the 800 series was designated as toll-free numbers. Over time, the additional area codes (833, 844, 855, 866, 877, and 888) were added to the list of toll-free numbers.  Considering that 844 is part of this newer series of toll-free area codes, it is likely that it is also available as a toll-free number in Canada, as it is part of the North American Numbering Plan. However, without explicit confirmation from a reliable source, this remains a hypothetical assumption.
1760474357	1760474360	Passage: Daylight saving time by country -- Most areas in North America and Europe, and some areas in the Middle East, observe daylight saving time (DST), while most areas of Africa and Asia do not. In South America, most countries in the north of the continent near the equator do not observe DST, while Paraguay and southern parts of Brazil do. The practice of observing daylight saving time in Oceania is also mixed, with New Zealand and parts of southeastern Australia observing DST, while most other areas do not.  Question: does any other country have daylight savings time  Explain your choice.	Yes, many countries around the world observe daylight saving time (DST). Some examples include:  1. Australia (except Western Australia and the Northern Territory): Most of Australia observes DST, with the clocks springing forward one hour in the fall and falling back one hour in the spring. 2. Brazil (southern states): As mentioned in the passage, some southern states in Brazil, such as Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina, observe DST. 3. China: China used to observe DST, but it was abolished in 1991. However, some regions in China, such as Hong Kong and Macau, still observe DST. 4. India: Some Indian states, such as Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra, observe DST. 5. Indonesia: Indonesia observes DST in some cities, including Jakarta and Bali. 6. Japan: Japan used to observe DST, but it was abolished in 1951. However, some prefectures, such as Okinawa, still observe DST. 7. Mexico: Mexico observes DST in some states, including the states of Mexico City, Guanajuato, and Nuevo León. 8. New Zealand: As mentioned in the passage, New Zealand observes DST. 9. Russia: Russia used to observe DST, but it was abolished in 2014. However, some regions, such as the Murmansk Oblast and the Republic of Karelia, still observe DST. 10. South Africa: South Africa observes DST, with the clocks springing forward one hour in the fall and falling back one hour in the spring.  These are just a few examples of countries that observe DST. There are many other countries that also practice daylight saving time, and the specifics of their DST policies can vary widely.
1760474360	1760474360	Passage: Johnny Vander Meer -- John Samuel Vander Meer (November 2, 1914 -- October 6, 1997) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a pitcher, most notably for the Cincinnati Reds. Vander Meer is best known for being the only pitcher in Major League Baseball history to throw two consecutive no-hitters. After the impressive start to his major league career, he experienced problems controlling the accuracy of his pitching, and his later career was marked by inconsistent performances.  Question: has anyone ever pitched back to back no hitters  Explain your choice.	Yes, someone else has pitched back-to-back no-hitters in Major League Baseball. The only other pitcher to achieve this feat is Addie Joss, who pitched two consecutive no-hitters in 1908, for the Cleveland Indians.
1760474360	1760474361	Passage: Black Bike Week -- Black Bike Week, also called Atlantic Beach Bikefest and Black Bikers Week, is an annual motorcycle rally in the Myrtle Beach, South Carolina area, held on Memorial Day weekend. It is also sometimes called Black Fill-in-the-Blank Week, because it has evolved to attract many non-motorcycling visitors who come for music, socializing and enjoying the beach. Events include motorcycle racing, concerts, parties, and street festivals. Called a ``one-of-a-kind event'' and ``an exhibitionist's paradise'' by Jeffrey Gettleman, Black Bike Week is ``all about riding, styling and profiling,'' in the words of Mayor Irene Armstrong of Atlantic Beach, South Carolina.  Question: is there a black bike week in myrtle beach  Explain your choice.	Yes, there is a Black Bike Week in Myrtle Beach. The passage states: "Black Bike Week -- Black Bike Week, also called Atlantic Beach Bikefest and Black Bikers Week, is an annual motorcycle rally in the Myrtle Beach, South Carolina area, held on Memorial Day weekend." This indicates that Myrtle Beach hosts an annual Black Bike Week event.
1760474361	1760474362	Passage: Static (DC Comics) -- It was recently revealed that prior to his abduction, Static teamed with Justice League member Black Lightning in order to stop former Blood Syndicate member Holocaust, who had tried to kill the superhero while he was acting as the keynote speaker at Ernest Hemingway High's senior graduation.  Question: are static shock and black lightning the same person  Explain your choice.	No, Static Shock and Black Lightning are not the same person.  Static Shock is the secret identity of Virgil Hawkins, a teenager who gained superpowers after being exposed to a gas that altered his DNA, allowing him to control and manipulate electricity. He is a character from the DC Comics universe.  Black Lightning, on the other hand, is the secret identity of Jefferson Pierce, a high school principal and father of the main character in the TV show "Black Lightning". He has the ability to control and manipulate electricity, similar to Static Shock.  Although both characters have similar powers, they are two distinct individuals with different backstories, personalities, and storylines in their respective comics and TV shows.
1760474362	1760474365	Passage: Unbreakable glass -- Unbreakable glass is glass, or glass substitute, which does not display the normal fragility of glass - in general the term is not used to refer to something that is absolutely unbreakable.  Question: is there such a thing as unbreakable glass  Explain your choice.	While there isn't truly "unbreakable" glass in the sense that it can withstand any impact without shattering, there are types of glass that are extremely resistant to breakage and are often referred to as "unbreakable" or "impact-resistant" glass.  These types of glass are designed to be highly durable and can withstand significant forces, such as impacts, drops, or other types of stress. Some examples include:  1. Tempered glass: Also known as toughened glass, this type of glass is heat-treated to increase its strength and reduce the likelihood of shattering. 2. Laminated glass: This type of glass is made by sandwiching a layer of plastic between two panes of glass, which helps to hold the glass together even if it breaks. 3. Fiberglass: This type of glass is made by embedding fiberglass into the glass, which adds strength and makes it more resistant to breakage. 4. Acrylic glass: Also known as acrylic, this type of glass is made from a type of plastic and is often used in applications where impact resistance is crucial.  While these types of glass are extremely resistant to breakage, they are not completely unbreakable. If subjected to a significant enough impact or force, they can still shatter or crack.  Therefore, while there isn't truly "unbreakable" glass, there are types of glass that are highly resistant to breakage and are often referred to as "unbreakable" or "impact-resistant" glass.
1760474365	1760474365	Passage: Liquid latex -- As the latex dries it becomes very sticky and will stick to itself if accidentally folded over. Most manufacturers offer a slick spray for latex once it is dry to take away the stickiness allowing the movement of the model's limbs. Alternatively, shimmer powders can be dusted over dried liquid latex to create metallic effects. One advantage to the tackiness of liquid latex is that it can act as an adhesive to attach things to the paint, such as zippers.  Question: can liquid latex be used as an adhesive  Explain your choice.	Yes, according to the passage, liquid latex can be used as an adhesive to attach things to the paint, such as zippers.
1760474365	1760474367	Passage: Gun laws in Texas -- Gov. Perry also signed H.B. 1815 after passage by the 2007 Legislature, a bill that allows any Texas resident to carry a handgun in the resident's motor vehicle without a CHL or other permit. The bill revised Chapter 46, Section 2 of the Penal Code to state that it is in fact not ``Unlawful Carry of a Weapon'', as defined by the statute, for a person to carry a handgun while in a motor vehicle they own or control, or to carry while heading directly from the person's home to that car. However, lawful carry while in a vehicle requires these four critical qualifiers: (1) the weapon must not be in plain sight (in Texas law, ``plain sight'' and ``concealed'' are mutually exclusive opposing terms); (2) the carrier cannot be involved in criminal activities, other than Class C traffic misdemeanors; (3) the carrier cannot be prohibited by state or federal law from possessing a firearm; and (4) the carrier cannot be a member of a criminal gang.  Question: is it illegal to carry a pistol in your car in texas  Explain your choice.	Based on the provided passage, it appears that, under Texas law, it is generally not entirely illegal to carry a pistol in your car, but there are specific conditions and qualifiers that must be met.  According to the passage, as long as you meet the following four criteria:  1. The pistol is not in plain sight. 2. You are not involved in any criminal activities, other than Class C traffic misdemeanors. 3. You are not prohibited by state or federal law from possessing a firearm. 4. You are not a member of a criminal gang.  If you meet these conditions, it is not considered "Unlawful Carry of a Weapon" under Texas law, and therefore, it is not explicitly stated as being illegal to carry a pistol in your car.  However, it is essential to note that there may be additional laws or regulations that could potentially restrict or prohibit carrying a pistol in your car in certain situations, such as:  - If you are transporting a handgun in a school zone or other restricted areas. - If you are transporting a handgun across state lines. - If you are carrying a handgun while under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance. - If you are carrying a handgun while committing or attempting to commit a crime.

1760474367	1760474369	Passage: Sgian-dubh -- When worn as part of the national dress of Scotland, the sgian-dubh is legal in Scotland, England and Wales. In Scotland under the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 Sec. 49, Sub-sec. 5(c); in England and Wales, under the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (section 139) and the Offensive Weapons Act 1996 (section 4).  Question: is it legal to carry a sgian dubh  Explain your choice.	Based on the provided passage, it appears that the legality of carrying a sgian-dubh (a type of dagger) varies depending on the location.  In Scotland, it is legal to carry a sgian-dubh under the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995, specifically section 49, sub-section 5(c).  In England and Wales, the laws regarding the carrying of a sgian-dubh are not explicitly stated in the provided passage. However, it can be inferred that it is not explicitly prohibited, as the passage mentions that the sgian-dubh is "legal in Scotland, England and Wales" when worn as part of the national dress of Scotland. This suggests that it may be allowed in these countries, but it is not explicitly stated as being legal in England and Wales.  Therefore, the most accurate answer would be:  * Legal in Scotland * May be legal in England and Wales, but not explicitly stated * Not explicitly stated as being illegal in Wales
1760474369	1760474370	Passage: Hypoglossal nerve -- The hypoglossal nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve, and innervates all the extrinsic and intrinsic muscles of the tongue, except for the palatoglossus which is innervated by the vagus nerve. It is a nerve with a solely motor function. The nerve arises from the hypoglossal nucleus in the brain stem as a number of small rootlets, passes through the hypoglossal canal and down through the neck, and eventually passes up again over the tongue muscles it supplies into the tongue. There are two hypoglossal nerves in the body: one on the left, and one on the right.  Question: several cranial nerves innervate structures of the tongue  Explain your choice.	The passage states that the hypoglossal nerve innervates all the extrinsic and intrinsic muscles of the tongue, except for the palatoglossus, which is innervated by the vagus nerve. This implies that there are at least two cranial nerves that innervate structures of the tongue:   1. The hypoglossal nerve (12th cranial nerve) 2. The vagus nerve (10th cranial nerve)
1760474370	1760474372	Passage: Puerto Rico -- Puerto Rico (Spanish for ``Rich Port''), officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (Spanish: Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, lit. ``Free Associated State of Puerto Rico'') and briefly called Porto Rico, is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea.  Question: is porto rico a part of the united states  Explain your choice.	No, Porto Rico (also known as Puerto Rico) is not a part of the United States, but it is a territory of the United States.  Although it is referred to as a "commonwealth," it is not a state, which is a state in the United States. As an unincorporated territory, Puerto Rico is subject to the authority of the US Congress, but it has a degree of autonomy and its own government.  Here are some key reasons why Porto Rico is not part of the United States:  1. Not a state: Puerto Rico is not one of the 50 states that make up the United States. 2. Unincorporated territory: Puerto Rico is not incorporated into the United States, meaning it is not a part of the US proper and is not subject to the same laws and taxes as states. 3. Subject to US Congress: Puerto Rico is subject to the authority of the US Congress, which makes laws and regulations that apply to the territory. 4. Autonomous government: Puerto Rico has its own government, which has some powers and responsibilities, but is still subject to the authority of the US Congress.  However, Puerto Rico has a unique relationship with the United States, and its residents are US citizens, but they do not have the same rights and privileges as citizens of states.
