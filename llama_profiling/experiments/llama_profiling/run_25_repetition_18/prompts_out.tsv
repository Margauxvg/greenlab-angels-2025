1760459966	1760459968	Premise: It was a complex language. Not written down but handed down. One might say it was peeled down.  Hypothesis: the language was peeled down  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states: ""It was a complex language. Not written down but handed down.""  This premise provides some information about the language, stating that it is complex and has been passed down orally, but it does not provide any information that directly supports the hypothesis that the language was ""peeled down"".  The term ""peeled down"" is not a common idiomatic expression, and it's unclear what it would mean for a language to be ""peeled down"". In contrast, the premise does not provide any context that would suggest this meaning.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to provide more information that directly supports the idea that the language was ""peeled down"", such as ""the language was simplified or reduced to its most basic form"" or ""the language was reduced in complexity"". As it stands, the premise is insufficient to entail the hypothesis."	188	
1760459968	1760459969	Premise: It is part of their religion, a religion I do not scoff at as it holds many elements which match our own even though it lacks the truth of ours. At one of their great festivals they have the ritual of driving out the devils from their bodies. First the drummers come on - I may say that no women are allowed to take part in this ritual and the ladies here will perhaps agree with me that they are fortunate in that omission.  Hypothesis: no women are allowed to take part in this ritual  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that ""no women are allowed to take part in this ritual"" is not explicitly mentioned. Instead, it is mentioned that ""the ladies here will perhaps agree"" with the statement that no women are allowed to take part in the ritual. This implies that the ladies may or may not agree, but it does not provide any information about whether they actually agree or not.   Therefore, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is necessarily true based on the premise. The premise only provides indirect information about the ladies' opinions, but it does not provide direct information about their participation in the ritual."	131	
1760459969	1760459971	Premise: The Paris to Rouen railway was being extended to Le Havre, and the line cut straight through Dr Flaubert's land. Part of it was to be compulsorily purchased. You could say that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy.  Hypothesis: Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that the Paris to Rouen railway was extended to Le Havre, and the line cut through Dr. Flaubert's land, part of which was compulsorily purchased. It also mentions that Gustave Flaubert (note: the correct spelling is ""Gustave"", not ""Gustave was shepherded"") was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy.  The hypothesis is a specific claim that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy. However, the premise does not provide any information about the relationship between the railway extension and epilepsy. It simply states that the railway extension led to the compulsory purchase of Dr. Flaubert's land, and that he went into creative retreat at Croisset.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to provide a direct link between the railway extension and the development of epilepsy in Gustave Flaubert, such as stating that the noise and disruption caused by the railway construction led to his epilepsy. The premise only mentions the railway extension and the compulsory purchase of Dr. Flaubert's land, but does not provide any information about the impact on his health."	249	
1760459971	1760459972	Premise: Part of it was to be compulsorily purchased. You could say that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy. You could also say he was driven there by the railway.  Hypothesis: Gustave was driven to creative retreat in Croisset by the railway  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that part of Gustave was compulsorily purchased and that he was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy. This implies that epilepsy played a significant role in Gustave's decision to retreat to Croisset.  However, the hypothesis states that Gustave was driven to creative retreat in Croisset by the railway. The premise does not mention the railway at all, so it does not provide any information that would support or imply the involvement of the railway.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.	120	
1760459972	1760459973	Premise: Some of them, like for instance the farm in Connecticut, are quite small. If I like a place I buy it. I guess you could say it's a hobby.  Hypothesis: buying places is a hobby  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that some people buy farms in Connecticut, and that if someone likes a place, they buy it. However, it does not state that buying places is a hobby. In fact, it implies that buying farms in Connecticut is more of a practical decision based on liking the location, rather than a leisure activity.  To make the hypothesis entail the premise, the statement would need to be rephrased to include the idea that buying places is a hobby, such as: ""If someone enjoys buying places, then they may buy farms in Connecticut."" This revised statement would make the hypothesis more closely aligned with the premise."	138	1.0
1760459973	1760459975	Premise: Look, my dear, I'm not in my dotage yet, and I know I'm a grumbler and a complainer. You could say the only form of comfort I 've got are my complaints.  Hypothesis: the only form of comfort he has are his complaints  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states: ""I'm not in my dotage yet, and I know I'm a grumbler and a complainer. You could say the only form of comfort I've got are my complaints.""  This premise describes the speaker's self-perception and their tendency to complain. It implies that they are aware of their own grumbling and complaining nature, but it does not necessarily mean that complaints are the only form of comfort they have.  The hypothesis states: ""the only form of comfort I've got are my complaints."" This is a stronger claim that implies that complaints are the sole source of comfort for the speaker. The hypothesis suggests a more absolute and definitive conclusion, whereas the premise only suggests that complaints are a notable aspect of the speaker's personality.  The premise provides evidence for the hypothesis, but it does not guarantee that the hypothesis is true. The speaker may have other sources of comfort that are not mentioned, or they may be able to find comfort in other ways that are not related to complaining. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	228	
1760459975	1760459976	Premise: Then the silence in the Zoo became complete. Woil stared around him and then suddenly with a push of his wings raised himself into the air, turned, and landed ten feet away on the back of a green bench. Creggan could see that he was afraid and that his fear was making him terribly uncertain.  Hypothesis: Woil was afraid  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that ""Woil stared around him and then suddenly with a push of his wings raised himself into the air, turned, and landed ten feet away on the back of a physical object (a green bench)"". The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that ""Woil was afraid"". The premise does not provide any information that would lead us to conclude that Woil is afraid.  The reason is that the premise focuses on Woil's actions (raising himself into the air and landing on the bench), while the hypothesis focuses on his emotional state (being afraid). The two pieces of information are separate and do not necessarily follow from each other. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	154	
1760459976	1760459977	Premise: But, of course, that just wasn't possible. Her disappointment over Jonathan, which had driven her to France in the first place, had been relegated somewhere to the back of her mind. Now in retrospect she could see that marriage to him would have been a ghastly mistake and that her reaction to discovering that he had been seeing other women while he had been engaged to her had had far more to do with wounded pride than with a wounded heart.  Hypothesis: marriage to Jonathan would have been a ghastly mistake  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that her disappointment over Jonathan had driven her to France, and that she could see now that marrying him would have been a ghastly mistake. However, it does not necessarily follow that the mistake was due to her being a victim of Jonathan's infidelity. The text mentions that her reaction to discovering his infidelity was driven by wounded pride, not a wounded heart, suggesting that her initial reaction was more about her own emotional state and pride rather than her heart being hurt.  In other words, the premise provides some indirect evidence that marrying Jonathan would have been a bad idea, but it does not provide sufficient reason to conclude that the reason for this is that he was unfaithful. The hypothesis assumes a specific reason (infidelity) that is not explicitly stated in the premise.	172	
1760459977	1760459979	Premise: Like now. The Community in Knockglen would defend Eve vociferously. Even some of the Sisters here in Dublin might see that the girl had a point.  Hypothesis: the girl had a point  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that ""the Community in Knockglen would defend Eve vociferously"" and ""Even some of the Sisters here in Dublin might see that the girl had a point."" This implies that the defense of Eve is not only possible but also likely, as the Community is willing to defend her and some individuals within the Sisters also agree with her perspective.  However, the hypothesis states that ""the girl had a point."" This is a more specific claim about Eve's perspective, which is not necessarily implied by the premise. The premise only suggests that there might be support for Eve's viewpoint, but it does not confirm that she actually has a valid point.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to include a stronger statement, such as ""the Community in Knockglen would defend Eve vociferously only because she has a valid point."" In this revised premise, the defense of Eve is not just possible, but it is also justified, which would entail that Eve actually has a valid point."	215	
1760459979	1760459980	Premise: ``They have to be crushed, Bobkins!'' So saying, she marched off down the gravel path, making the kind of crunching noise Robert had thought could only be produced by the BBC sound-effects department. As they rounded the edge of the building he could see that behind the house was a vast garden.  Hypothesis: behind the house was a vast garden  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that someone says ""They have to be crushed, Bobkins!"" and then marches off down a gravel path, but it does not provide any information about the nature of what ""they"" are or what the consequences of their actions will be. The hypothesis ""behind the house was a vast garden"" is an inference that can be drawn from the context, but it is not explicitly stated in the premise.  The premise only mentions that the person is marching down a path, which could be leading to a variety of locations, not necessarily a garden. The hypothesis is an assumption that is not necessarily supported by the information provided in the premise."	143	
1760459980	1760459981	Premise: ``Do you mind if I use your phone?'' Ronni could see that Guido's brain was whirring.  Hypothesis: Guido's brain was whirring  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that Ronni asked Guido if he could use his phone, but it does not provide any information about Guido's mental state or his brain's activity. The phrase ""Guido's brain was whirring"" is a separate statement that is not implied by the premise. The premise only mentions Guido's physical action of hearing Ronni's question, but it does not provide any information about his thoughts or mental state.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to include some information that suggests Guido's brain is whirring, such as ""Guido's brain was whirring"" or ""Guido was deep in thought."" The current premise only provides information about the question being asked, not Guido's mental state."	166	
1760459981	1760459983	Premise: ``Look, lady, give me a break. I just deliver the stuff, I don't interview it for the Sunday papers.'' He waved the paper at her and even at a distance she could see that it said very little.  Hypothesis: the paper said very little  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""Look, lady, give me a break. I just deliver the stuff, I don't interview it for the Sunday papers"" does not entail the hypothesis ""the paper said very little"".  Entailment requires that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true. However, the premise only states that the speaker waves a paper at the lady, saying ""I don't interview it for the Sunday papers"", which implies that the paper is related to the Sunday papers, but it does not provide any information about what the paper actually says. The hypothesis ""the paper said very little"" is not necessarily true just because the premise mentions the Sunday papers. There could be many reasons why the paper says a lot, just as there are many reasons why it might say very little.  In other words, the premise only establishes a connection between the speaker and the paper, but it does not provide any information about the content of the paper. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	204	
1760459983	1760459985	Premise: ``You 've heard something like that before. Haven't you, Jimmy?'' Jimmy had been shaken by those sounds more shaken than the others for good reason but Cardiff could see that he was unprepared to show it as he pushed himself away from the reception counter.  Hypothesis: Jimmy was unprepared to show he had been shaken  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Jimmy had been shaken by the sounds, but it does not necessarily imply that he was unprepared to show it. In fact, the premise suggests the opposite: that Jimmy was ""shaken"" (implying he was emotionally disturbed or upset) and that he was pushing himself away from the reception counter, which could be a sign of him trying to compose himself or hide his emotions. The phrase ""unprepared to show it"" in the hypothesis introduces an additional assumption that Jimmy's shaking is not just a physical reaction, but also a desire to conceal it, which is not explicitly stated in the premise.  To make the premise entail the hypothesis, it would need to be rephrased to include information that explicitly links Jimmy's shaking to his unwillingness to show it, such as: ""Jimmy had been shaken by the sounds, but he was unprepared to show it, and he pushed himself away from the reception counter."""	204	
1760459985	1760459986	Premise: It was Alan's idea. He made a sour kind of joke out of it, that they must wait until their wedding night. Carolyn agreed because she could see he meant it although she didn't understand why.  Hypothesis: Alan meant it  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  In the premise, Alan makes a ""sour kind of joke"" about waiting until their wedding night, but it's not clear if he meant it literally or not. The phrase ""sour kind of joke"" implies that Alan might be making a humorous or ironic comment, rather than a serious suggestion.  The fact that Carolyn agrees to wait until their wedding night, despite not understanding why, suggests that she might not have interpreted Alan's comment in the same way that he intended. This ambiguity means that the premise does not provide enough information to conclude that Alan meant it literally.  In order to entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to provide more context or clarify Alan's intentions. For example, if the premise stated ""Alan joked that they must wait until their wedding night"" or ""Alan said they had to wait until their wedding night,"" it would be more likely that the hypothesis would be entailed. However, as it stands, the premise leaves too much room for interpretation."	210	
1760459986	1760459987	Premise: And why bother to write anyway? What was there to say? Mary had some vague idea that Adam's parents might suspect he was down here and come to see him.  Hypothesis: Adam was down here  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Mary had a vague idea that Adam's parents might suspect he was down here and come to see him. However, it does not provide any direct evidence or logical connection between this idea and the hypothesis that Adam is indeed down here.  The premise only mentions that Mary has a suspicion, but it does not confirm or deny the hypothesis. It is possible that Mary's suspicion is unfounded, or that she is just speculating, or that she has no reason to think Adam is down here. The premise does not provide any concrete information that would necessarily lead us to conclude that Adam is down here.  Therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.	149	
1760459987	1760459989	Premise: ``And you're not having this dress,'' Nora said, bending down to look at the price tag. ``It's two and a half guineas!'' she hissed at Louise who could tell that she was genuinely appalled.  Hypothesis: Nora was genuinely appalled  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise and hypothesis are related, but not identical.  The premise states that Nora said, ""And you're not having this dress,"" and then mentions that she is ""genuinely appalled"" by the price tag. However, the premise does not explicitly state that Nora's tone or mannerisms convey her emotions. The phrase ""bending down to look at the price tag"" could also imply that Nora is simply examining the price tag, rather than being genuinely appalled.  The hypothesis, ""Nora was genuinely appalled,"" assumes that Nora's actions and tone convey her emotions, which is not explicitly stated in the premise. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise only tells us that Nora is making a statement about the dress, but it does not provide information about her emotional state.  To make the hypothesis more explicit, the premise would need to include additional information about Nora's tone, facial expression, or body language, which is not present in this scenario."	204	
1760459989	1760459991	Premise: She said good morning to Alice and Alice said hallo. She was thin and rather tall with a very lined gentle face and hair that was white but which Alice could see had once been blonde. She could also have told this was Tina's mother before Mrs Darne went off down the passage that led to the Headmaster's Flat.  Hypothesis: this was Tina's mother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise does entail the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states that the speaker says ""She said good morning to Alice and Alice said hallo."" This implies that the speaker is describing a conversation between the woman (who is referred to as ""She"") and Alice. The speaker then provides physical descriptions of the woman, including her age, height, face, and hair color.  The hypothesis is that this woman is Tina's mother. The premise provides strong evidence to support this hypothesis by mentioning that Mrs. Darne (presumably Tina's mother) went off down the passage that led to the Headmaster's Flat. This detail suggests that the woman being described is indeed Tina's mother.  Furthermore, the speaker's tone and language in the premise imply a level of familiarity and knowledge about the woman and her relationship to Tina, which further supports the hypothesis.  Therefore, based on the information provided in the premise, it is reasonable to conclude that the woman being described is indeed Tina's mother."	204	
1760459991	1760459993	Premise: She might have sat all afternoon, nibbling and stuporous, exhausted but not sleepy. But the glazier finally came down from the upper floor, cheerfully announcing that all was now right and tight and he would be on his way. Maggie could tell that he would have liked to stop for a chat that he felt sorry for her left on her own but she lacked either her grandmother's grace or her mother's energy so she did not offer him tea.  Hypothesis: the glazier would have liked to stop for a chat  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise suggests that the glazier would have liked to stop for a chat, but it does not entail that he would have liked to stop for a chat.  To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. An entailment relationship is a type of implication where if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true.  In this case, the premise states that the glazier ""would have liked to stop for a chat"" but does not explicitly state that the glazier actually did stop for a chat. The premise is conditional on the glazier's intention, not on the actual outcome. Therefore, the premise does not entail that the glazier stopped for a chat.  However, the premise does suggest that the glazier's intention to stop for a chat was likely based on his feeling sorry for Maggie, which implies that the hypothesis is more likely to be true. But the premise does not guarantee that the glazier actually stopped for a chat, so it does not entail the hypothesis.  So, the correct answer is that the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	238	
1760459993	1760459994	Premise: Jim waited. He waited a long time, and when the young doctor finally came out, it was almost dark. Jim could nonetheless tell by his anxious face that something was wrong.  Hypothesis: something was wrong  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Jim waited a long time, and when the young doctor finally came out, it was almost dark. It also states that Jim could tell by the doctor's anxious face that something was wrong. However, this does not logically entail that the doctor's anxious face is a result of the fact that something is wrong. The anxious face could also be a result of other factors, such as the doctor being tired, stressed, or simply having a bad day.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to provide more information that directly links the doctor's anxious face to the fact that something is wrong. For example:  ""The young doctor finally came out, and as Jim watched, she visibly trembled and her eyes darted nervously around the room, which suggested that she was hiding something.""  In this revised premise, the doctor's anxious behavior is more directly linked to the fact that something is wrong, making it more likely that the hypothesis is entailed."	210	
1760459994	1760459996	Premise: ``Yes?'' ``Nathan?'' He could tell it was long-distance the line was so gravelly and hollow but he didn't recognise the voice.  Hypothesis: the call was long-distance  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that ""He could tell it was long-distance the line was so gravelly and hollow,"" which suggests that the voice on the other end is not familiar to the speaker, but it does not provide any information about the location of the call.  The hypothesis, ""the call was long-distance,"" is a specific claim about the nature of the call, whereas the premise is a general statement about the speaker's observation of the voice. The premise does not provide any direct evidence to support the hypothesis, and it is possible to imagine a scenario where the call is not long-distance but the voice is gravelly and hollow nonetheless.  To make the premise entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to provide more information that directly connects the characteristics of the voice to the fact that the call is long-distance, such as ""He could tell it was long-distance because the voice was distorted and unclear."" In its current form, the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis."	209	
1760459996	1760459997	Premise: Chopra stood unsteadily on his feet. The shapechanger bounded around with excitement. Chopra could tell something had happened.  Hypothesis: something had happened  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Chopra stood unsteadily on his feet and the shapechanger bounded around with excitement, implying that something unusual had happened. However, it does not explicitly state that the shapechanger is Chopra, nor does it imply that the shapechanger is the cause of the excitement.  The hypothesis states that ""something had happened"", which is a very general and vague statement. While the premise suggests that something unusual has occurred, it does not provide enough information to conclusively determine what that something is or how it relates to Chopra. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	132	
1760459997	1760459998	Premise: It seemed impossible that anyone could endure such pain for so long, but at last the doors of the Renault slammed and there was comparative silence. The engine was started up, revving violently as the car was turned round on the narrow road. John could tell that it was being driven back up the hill towards Putna.  Hypothesis: the car was being driven back up the hill towards Putna  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the car was being driven back up the hill towards Putna, but it does not guarantee that the driver will be able to endure the pain for a long time. The hypothesis states that the driver (John) could endure such pain for so long, but the premise does not provide any information about John's ability to endure pain. The premise only mentions the physical action of the car being driven up the hill, but it does not address the driver's emotional or physical state.  In other words, the premise only describes a physical action, while the hypothesis makes an inference about the driver's subjective experience. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.	147	
1760459998	1760459999	Premise: Just when you think you 've got it straight, along comes the Fool with his pig's bladder and whops you on the nose. By the way, I'm no idiot. I could tell Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see me at the airport.  Hypothesis: Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see her at the airport  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise is a sentence that sets the scene for a story, while the hypothesis is a statement that suggests Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see you at the airport.  The premise only mentions that the speaker saw Gillian and Stuart at the airport, but it does not provide any information about their emotions or reactions towards the speaker. It only mentions that the speaker thinks they ""had it straight"" and then gets ""whops"" (presumably hit or slapped) on the nose by the Fool, which is a separate event.  The hypothesis is a separate statement that is not logically connected to the premise. To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to provide more information about Gillian and Stuart's emotions or reactions towards the speaker."	161	
1760459999	1760460001	Premise: He's weird enough to have undressed me without thinking, according to some mad notion of the ``proper'' thing to do. Perhaps he thought I couldn't lie in bed with my clothes on.  Hypothesis: she couldn't lie in bed with her clothes on  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that someone undressed the speaker without their consent, implying that the person who undressed the speaker was acting in a way that was unwanted or inappropriate. However, it does not provide any information about the speaker's personal habits or preferences regarding lying in bed.  The hypothesis suggests that the speaker couldn't lie in bed with their clothes on, which is an assumption about the speaker's behavior, not a conclusion that can be inferred from the premise. The premise only discusses the actions of the person who undressed the speaker, not the speaker's own behavior.  For example, it's possible that the speaker is a neat freak and always lies in bed with their clothes on, or that they were too busy or distracted to get out of bed, and the person who undressed them didn't notice. The premise does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis.	187	
1760460001	1760460002	Premise: That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort. Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all. But you will perhaps understand that there was a natural tendency on my part in asking what was after all a generous favour from my employer to hint that there was a good professional motive behind my request.  Hypothesis: there was a natural tendency on her part to hint that there was a good professional motive behind her request  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the narrator thought it would have been wiser not to mention Miss Kenton because Mr. Farraday enjoys lighthearted and humorous conversations, and Miss Kenton would likely respond in a bantering tone. However, this does not imply that Miss Kenton herself has a natural tendency to hint at a good professional motive behind her request.  The premise is actually suggesting that the narrator should not have mentioned Miss Kenton because of Mr. Farraday's personality, but it does not provide any information about Miss Kenton's personality or behavior. The hypothesis is a separate claim about Miss Kenton's behavior, and it is not logically entailed by the premise.	150	
1760460002	1760460003	Premise: But don't dilly-dally for too long. Once it's published we are all going to look a little risible if we have made no adjustments to what is after all known as being predominantly my own design of gallery. Also I am a bit older than the rest of you but you can perhaps understand that I don't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation.  Hypothesis: he doesn't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that the speaker is concerned about appearing ""risible"" (ridiculous) if no adjustments are made to their design after it is published, and that they want a public recantation before they die.   The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the speaker wants a public recantation before they drop dead.  The premise does not mention anything about the speaker wanting to drop dead, only that they don't want to appear ridiculous after the design is published. The hypothesis introduces a new and unrelated event (dropping dead) that is not implied in the premise.   Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	143	
1760460003	1760460005	Premise: I should dearly have liked to know whether they were Europeans or Americans, but I couldn't hear the accents. They appeared to be arguing. I hoped the white men weren't telling him to eliminate all witnesses because I don't believe it would have needed much persuasion.  Hypothesis: eliminating all witnesses would have needed much persuasion  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the speaker hopes the white men aren't telling the other person to eliminate all witnesses, implying that the speaker believes it would be a persuasive tactic. However, the hypothesis states that eliminating all witnesses would have needed much persuasion.  The premise suggests that the speaker thinks eliminating all witnesses would be a persuasive tactic, but it does not necessarily mean that it would have needed much persuasion. The speaker is simply making an assumption about the persuasiveness of the tactic, not making a claim about the amount of persuasion required.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to include information that suggests that eliminating all witnesses would be a difficult or unlikely tactic, or that the speaker believes it would require a significant amount of effort or convincing. The current premise only implies that the speaker thinks eliminating all witnesses might be a persuasive tactic, but it does not provide any information about the actual difficulty or persuasiveness of the tactic.	198	
1760460005	1760460006	Premise: But the damage was done as far as my faith was concerned, which is probably why I went mad. So anyway, that Christmas Eve night confirmed my worst fears, it was like a kind of ``royal flush'' for the infant Jimbo. All three kings - Pa Santa and the King of Kings - all down the pan together... And to be honest I don't believe any of them stands a chance of ever making a comeback with me.  Hypothesis: any of the three kings stands a chance of ever making a comeback with him  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the narrator's faith was damaged and that this led to their going mad, and it mentions that Christmas Eve night was a ""royal flush"" for the infant Jimbo, implying that Jimbo's fate was sealed. However, it does not provide any information about the possibility of the three kings (Pa Santa and the King of Kings) making a comeback.  The hypothesis, ""any of the three kings stands a chance of ever making a comeback with him,"" is a separate statement that is not implied by the premise. The premise does not provide any context or information that would suggest the three kings have any agency or possibility of recovery, and the tone of the passage is quite negative and fatalistic."	157	
1760460006	1760460007	Premise: He had seen something I should have, which was a car turning in from Soho Square and coming up behind me. My right foot hovered over the accelerator pedal and I balanced Armstrong on the clutch. I wasn't as convinced as Malpass that Nevil was out of harm's way.  Hypothesis: Nevil was out of harm's way  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that the narrator had seen a car turning in from Soho Square and coming up behind them, and that they had balanced Armstrong on the clutch. This suggests that the narrator was in a car and was preparing to accelerate, but it does not provide any information about Nevil's whereabouts or safety.  The hypothesis states that Nevil was out of harm's way, but the premise does not provide any information that would support this claim. In fact, the narrator's uncertainty about Nevil's safety (""I wasn't as convinced as Malpass that Nevil was out of harm's way"") suggests that the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis."	144	
1760460007	1760460008	Premise: Jed wondered. He 'd scarcely set eyes on him since the night they 'd had dinner together at the house in Westwood. Nobody had mentioned him either and Jed didn't feel he should ask.  Hypothesis: Jed should ask  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Jed hasn't seen the person since dinner at Westwood and that nobody has mentioned him since then. However, it doesn't logically follow that Jed should ask about him. The premise provides information about the situation, but it doesn't provide any reason or justification for why Jed should ask.  The hypothesis suggests that Jed should ask, but the premise doesn't provide any underlying motivation or reason for this action. The hypothesis seems to be an assumption or a recommendation that is not explicitly supported by the premise.	116	
1760460008	1760460009	Premise: Yet what good came from knowing that a woman had killed herself? The children who had suffered a trauma would survive the experience, scarred by it and a little flawed by it. They would never forget that for a week they had imagined the act of murder had been committed.  Hypothesis: for a week the children had imagined the act of murder had been committed  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that the children suffered a trauma, and that they would survive the experience, but it does not provide any information about the nature of the trauma or what specifically they imagined. The hypothesis suggests that they imagined the act of murder had been committed, but this is not explicitly stated in the premise.   The premise only mentions the children's survival and the trauma, but does not provide any details about the content of their imagination. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.	114	1.0
1760460009	1760460010	Premise: Nora calculated that there must be lots of single men up there so she decided it was ideal for the ``manhunt'', as we called it, even though the train fare was a serious consideration. I remember we went up to Euston together one Saturday morning, very excited, to buy the ticket in advance. It was a secret - if my parents had known she was going away alone they would have soon put the kybosh on it.  Hypothesis: Nora was going away alone  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that Nora calculated that there must be lots of single men up there, which suggests that she is going to a place where she might meet single men, but it does not explicitly state that she is going alone. The text also mentions that her parents would ""put the kybosh on"" the trip if they knew she was going alone, implying that she is actually going with someone else."	93	
1760460010	1760460011	Premise: His mother driving the car, so happy, young-looking and fashionably dressed and his father, a big, confident man in a smart suit, smiling and turning round to say something to Simon in the back seat. Marie thought of her own mother with her frumpy clothes and ageing, lined face. No one would have guessed that she was only forty-two.  Hypothesis: Marie's mother was only forty-two  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that Marie thought of her own mother, which implies that Marie is the one making the comparison. It also mentions her mother's appearance, but it doesn't provide any information that would necessarily lead to the conclusion that her mother is forty-two. The description of the mother in the car could be someone else's mother, and it's not explicitly stated that Marie's mother matches that description.   The hypothesis requires a logical connection between the premise and the conclusion. In this case, the premise does not provide enough information to establish that Marie's mother is forty-two.	125	
1760460011	1760460012	Premise: ``I hope you are settling down and the cat is well.'' This was a lie. She did not hope the cat was well.  Hypothesis: the cat was well  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise ""I hope you are settling down and the cat is well"" is a statement that expresses a sentiment or attitude towards the speaker's friend. However, it does not provide any information about the actual condition of the cat. The speaker is making a polite or friendly comment, but it is not a statement that guarantees or implies the cat's actual health status.  The hypothesis ""the cat is well"" is a separate claim that is not supported or implied by the premise. The speaker's statement does not provide any evidence or reasons to believe that the cat is actually healthy, and it is possible that the cat may be ill or otherwise not well.  In this case, the premise is an expression of goodwill or politeness, while the hypothesis is a separate claim that is not necessarily supported by the premise."	175	
1760460012	1760460013	Premise: Jane ate without pausing. Hunger was an unknown experience. She had never imagined it could actually hurt.  Hypothesis: hunger could actually hurt  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Jane ate without pausing and that hunger was an unknown experience to her, implying that she was unaware of what hunger felt like. However, it does not directly state that hunger can hurt. The hypothesis is a specific claim that hunger can actually hurt, which is not necessarily implied by the premise.  The premise only sets the stage for the hypothesis by providing context about Jane's situation, but it does not provide enough information to support the specific claim that hunger can hurt. To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to include some information that directly links hunger to pain or discomfort, such as ""hunger was an intense, unbearable feeling"" or ""hunger was accompanied by a sharp pain""."	155	
1760460013	1760460015	Premise: Miss Martindale had had a school, but her rigid ideas and stern manner had frightened the children, and their parents had taken them away. And gradually the school declined, until she had to give it up and retire to end her days in the white cottage with the inevitable cat as her only companion. Breeze had never imagined that digging was such hard work.  Hypothesis: digging was such hard work  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise describes Miss Martindale's situation and her eventual retirement, but it does not explicitly state that digging was hard work. The sentence ""Breeze had never imagined that digging was such hard work"" is a separate statement that introduces a new idea and is not a direct consequence of the events described in the premise. It is a statement made by Breeze, who is not a character in the premise.   However, it can be inferred that digging is hard work based on the context, as the premise states that Miss Martindale had to give up her school, suggesting that she was unable to maintain it. This could be due to her inability to perform tasks such as digging, which might be implied to be difficult or laborious. Nevertheless, the premise does not explicitly state that digging is hard work, making it an inference rather than a direct entailment."	185	
1760460015	1760460016	Premise: ``You don't need to worry. We're quite adequately chaperoned. Rosa is a woman of strict moral principles.'' If she knows I'm in here she's probably hovering outside the door right now.  Hypothesis: he's in here  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that ""Rosa is a woman of strict moral principles"" and ""If she knows I'm in here, she's probably hovering outside the door right now."" The premise asserts the existence of Rosa and her moral character, but it does not guarantee that she is aware of the speaker's presence or that she will be hovering outside the door if she knows about it.  The hypothesis is that Rosa knows the speaker is in the room and is hovering outside the door. The premise does not provide any information about Rosa's knowledge or her actions if she were to know about the speaker's presence. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	143	
1760460016	1760460017	Premise: I said you were mad to come over at this time. It's a world event. Don't you know that Venice is packed with visitors?  Hypothesis: Venice is packed with visitors  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise states: ""It's a world event.""   The hypothesis states: ""Venice is packed with visitors.""  The premise is not directly related to the number of visitors in Venice. It simply states that there is a world event happening, without specifying what kind of event or where it is taking place.  The hypothesis, however, makes a specific claim about the current state of Venice, which is that it is packed with visitors. This claim is not supported by the premise, which does not provide any information about the number of visitors or the current situation in Venice.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	128	
1760460017	1760460018	Premise: And what she had said, and went on saying quietly, calmly, efficiently, was that she loved Maggie. She paid attention. At eight Maggie had not known that her grandmother was famous but she had seen that people had something in their manner when they looked at Rachel.  Hypothesis: Maggie's grandmother was famous  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that ""And what she had said, and went on saying quietly, calmly, efficiently, was that she loved Maggie."" This suggests that the speaker's grandmother is expressing her love for Maggie, but it does not provide any information about the grandmother's level of fame.  The hypothesis, ""Maggie's grandmother was famous,"" is an inference that can be drawn from the sentence ""At eight Maggie had not known that her grandmother was famous."" However, this inference is not necessarily supported by the premise. The fact that Maggie did not know about her grandmother's fame at age 8 does not imply that she is famous now. It could be that Maggie just didn't know, or that her grandmother was not famous when Maggie was 8.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	173	
1760460018	1760460019	Premise: They 'd seen Miss Lavant on the promenade and about the town, always walking slowly, sometimes with a neat wicker basket. Kate had often thought she was beautiful. She hadn't known she was in love with Dr Greenslade who had a wife already and three children.  Hypothesis: Miss Lavant was in love with Dr Greenslade  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise only mentions that Miss Lavant is seen walking slowly with a wicker basket, and that Kate often thought she was beautiful. It does not provide any information that directly links Miss Lavant to Dr Greenslade, let alone suggest that she is in love with him. The premise only mentions Dr Greenslade's relationship status (having a wife and three children), but does not indicate that Miss Lavant is in love with him.	101	
1760460019	1760460020	Premise: Did he intend everyone in the castle to know he did not want the wife he had married in such a hurry? Did he intend to ignore her completely? Then Isabel saw Ellen's stunned face and realised that her maid at least did not know she had spent the night alone.  Hypothesis: Isabel had spent the night alone  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that Isabel saw Ellen's stunned face and realized that her maid at least did not know she had spent the night alone. This implies that Isabel did not want the wife she had married in a hurry to know about her nocturnal activities with Ellen. However, it does not provide any information about whether Isabel intended to ignore her wife completely or not.   The premise only mentions that Isabel wanted to keep her actions a secret from her wife, but it does not provide any information about her intentions towards the wife in general. It does not imply that Isabel intended to ignore her wife or that she had any intention of ignoring her wife.   Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis that Isabel intended to ignore her wife completely.	159	
1760460020	1760460022	Premise: Most of them young, about his age, stood and talked and drank and laughed. The two girls he had noticed earlier were standing talking to some other girls. Graham hoped they all realised that just because he was standing talking to Slater that didn't mean he was gay too.  Hypothesis: Graham was gay too  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Graham is standing with a group of young people, talking and laughing, and that two girls he had noticed earlier are also present. It also mentions that he hopes the other girls will assume he is not gay because he is standing with the group, implying that Graham himself is not gay.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Graham is gay. The premise does not provide any information that suggests Graham's sexual orientation, and the fact that he is standing with a group of people does not necessarily imply that he is gay. The premise actually contradicts the hypothesis by suggesting that Graham hopes the others will not assume he is gay.	144	
1760460022	1760460023	Premise: He said that maybe I wasn't ready to join the Party just yet. Terry's passion for equality appealed to my purer mind, and his hatred of existing authority appealed to my resentments. But although I hated inequality it didn't mean I wanted to be treated like everyone else.  Hypothesis: he wanted to be treated like everyone else  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states that the narrator's passion for equality and hatred of existing authority appealed to their purer mind and resentments, respectively. However, the premise does not provide any information that suggests the narrator's desire for equality or hatred of authority is not already present. In fact, it implies that the narrator already has these feelings.  The hypothesis states that Terry wanted to be treated like everyone else. This is a separate idea that is not supported by the premise. The premise only discusses the narrator's existing feelings and how they were influenced by Terry's words, but it does not provide any information about Terry's motivations or desires.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to provide evidence that Terry's actions or words were intended to promote a sense of equality, or that he wanted the narrator to be treated like everyone else. As it stands, the premise only discusses the narrator's own feelings and reactions to Terry's words, not Terry's intentions or motivations.	210	
1760460023	1760460025	Premise: ``Oh, my poor Folly... We 've been together for five years, Lexy and I - she practically holds that company together. Of course I gave her an ``A''. But that doesn't mean I'm having an affair with her.  Hypothesis: he is having an affair with Lexy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the speaker has given Lexy an ""A"" and that they have been together for five years, but it does not provide any information that suggests the speaker is having an affair with Lexy. The fact that Lexy holds the company together could imply that she is a crucial employee or partner, but it does not necessarily mean that the speaker is having an affair with her.  In order to entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to provide additional information that suggests the speaker's intentions or actions are inconsistent with the claim that they are not having an affair with Lexy. For example, the premise could include statements like ""We've been sneaking around behind her back"" or ""I've been lying to her about my whereabouts on the nights I've been with her."" Without this additional information, the premise is neutral and does not entail the hypothesis."	187	
1760460025	1760460027	Premise: Nevertheless, her heart sank at the thought of spending an evening with him in his present state of mind, and she was tempted to invent a sore throat in order to get out of it. But he had been very helpful over the Puddephat business, she admitted to herself, and his moods were unpredictable - he might be on top of the world by the time he arrived at the cinema. ``I'm still keen if you are '' she said brightly pretending she had not noticed anything was amiss.  Hypothesis: something was amiss  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  Here's why:  The premise states: ""her heart sank at the thought of spending an evening with him in his present state of mind"". This suggests that the speaker has reason to believe that something is wrong with the person's current mental state, and this knowledge is causing her distress. This implies that there is a hypothesis that the person is not in a good state of mind, which is the hypothesis being entertained by the speaker.  Additionally, the fact that the speaker is tempted to invent a sore throat to get out of the evening and is aware of the person's unpredictable moods further supports the idea that something is amiss. This shows that the speaker has prior knowledge or suspicion about the person's current state of mind, which is a key aspect of formulating a hypothesis.  The phrase ""his moods were unpredictable"" also supports the hypothesis, as it implies that the speaker has observed the person's behavior in the past and knows that their moods can be difficult to predict, which is a common characteristic of someone who is not in a good state of mind.  Overall, the premise provides sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that something is amiss with the person's mental state."	251	
1760460027	1760460028	Premise: What must it be like to be imprisoned here, day after day, month after month? I wonder, does he keep them chained and manacled, thought Fenella, or does he use sorcery? And so utterly immersed was she in this strange blue and green land that was not feeling strange any more that she did not even notice that she was weighing sorcery against steel chains and seriously considering the likely outcome.  Hypothesis: Fenella was weighing sorcery against steel chains  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise describes Fenella's thoughts and surroundings, but it does not make any claims or assertions about the treatment of prisoners in the land. The mention of ""steel chains"" and ""sorcery"" is simply a part of the descriptive language used to set the scene, and it is not a statement about the reality of the prisoners' confinement.  The hypothesis suggests that Fenella is considering the possibility that the prisoners are kept chained, but the premise does not provide any information that would lead to this conclusion. The premise does not imply that the prisoners are chained, nor does it suggest that Fenella has any reason to believe they are chained. The mention of sorcery is more related to Fenella's thoughts and speculations, rather than any information about the prisoners' confinement.  Therefore, the premise and the hypothesis are not logically connected, and the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."	193	
1760460028	1760460030	Premise: Strasbourg, Vienna, Bucharest, Istanbul, not stopping, not looking back. I saw her tossing newly gauffred curls as the open roadster headed east, away from Ollie... Temporarily I managed to re-erect my jocular facade, but inside I was panicking. He could take her away I thought he could just do that he has such power to hurt me this little furry creature who hasn't even noticed that I 've given up the weed.  Hypothesis: he has given up the weed  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that the narrator is running away from Ollie, and the narrator is panicking because they think Ollie has the power to hurt them. However, the hypothesis states that Ollie has given up the weed. These two statements are not logically connected. The premise does not provide any information about Ollie's actions or habits related to weed, so it is not reasonable to infer that he has given up the weed based on the given information.  The premise only mentions the narrator's anxiety about Ollie's potential to hurt them and their desire to escape, but it does not provide any context or clues that would suggest Ollie's involvement with weed. Therefore, the hypothesis is not supported by the premise.	162	
1760460030	1760460032	Premise: It - the tractor, the boys and the bulbs in the earth - knew she had chosen for them and was coming back to them. Of course there was still love, there was healthy, growing love and its name was called Work. She had fallen in love with it so slowly and gently and sweetly that she had never noticed it had happened.  Hypothesis: falling in love had happened  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise suggests that the tractor, the boys, and the bulbs in the earth are awaiting the return of the one who had chosen them, implying that they are somehow dependent on her. However, it does not provide any information that would necessarily link this return to the concept of love. The return of the one who had chosen them could be due to various reasons, such as completion of a project, a promise, or even a coincidence.  The phrase ""healthy, growing love"" is used to describe the love that the subject has for ""Work"", which is a noun that refers to the act of labor or the process of cultivation. This suggests that the subject has developed a strong affection or attachment to work, but it does not imply that she has fallen in love with the concept of work itself.  The hypothesis ""falling in love had happened"" is not supported by the premise, as there is no indication that the subject has experienced romantic love or that she has fallen in love with someone or something. The passage primarily focuses on the subject's connection to work and her growing affection for it, rather than her romantic relationships or emotions."	241	
1760460032	1760460033	Premise: After the twelfth dot, two thirds of the way down the page, the transcript of this long session tails away into blank paper. I suppose what's happened is this. He has gone on staring out of the window thinking and she has gone on staring at him waiting with such absorption that neither of them noticed the tape had run out.  Hypothesis: the tape had run out  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that ""the transcript of this long session tails away into blank paper two thirds of the way down the page"", which implies that the transcript is incomplete due to the tape running out, but it does not explicitly state that the tape running out is the reason for the blank paper. The premise leaves room for other explanations, such as the blank paper being the result of another issue, like a formatting error or an accident.   To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to explicitly state that the blank paper is a result of the tape running out, e.g. ""the blank paper was the result of the tape running out"" or ""the blank paper was caused by the tape running out""."	153	
1760460033	1760460034	Premise: ``His name is Matthew Blake,'' Mandy informed Charity as they descended the steps from their cabin on to the paved pathway that led to the lodge. Thankfully she hadn't even noticed that Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt and was now wearing red shorts with her white silk blouse.  Hypothesis: Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Mandy informed Charity about something, but it does not specify what that something is. It also mentions that Charity had changed her outfit, but it does not imply that the change is related to what Mandy informed her about.  In order for the premise to entail the hypothesis, it would need to explicitly state that the change in Charity's outfit is related to the information Mandy shared with her. For example, the premise could be rephrased as: ""Mandy informed Charity that she had changed into red shorts with her white silk blouse, and Charity was surprised that she hadn't noticed."" This revised premise would entail the hypothesis."	145	
1760460034	1760460035	Premise: ``These ` ere smugglers is a dangerous bunch from wot I 've ` eard!'' ``If only we could devise a safe way of laying our hands on all that money,'' murmured Pugwash, whose greed was as proverbial as his cowardice. And the pirates were so busy discussing the problem and what they would do with the reward if they won it that they didn't notice that they were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage.  Hypothesis: the pirates were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the pirates were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage. However, it does not provide any information that would necessitate the conclusion that the pirates were being observed by the new Mayor and his entourage. The presence of the Mayor and his entourage in the scene does not logically follow from the information provided in the premise.  The premise only tells us that the pirates were being observed, but it does not specify who the observer is. It is possible that the observer could be anyone else, such as a member of the town watch, a curious onlooker, or even a fictional character with a similar setup. Therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.	161	
1760460035	1760460037	Premise: Ockleton, Morpurgo, Cornelius, Dysart and half a dozen others too drunk to mention. But there was so much coming and going that any one of us could have slipped out, pushed Everett through the window and slipped back again without being noticed. Damn it all we didn't even notice Everett was missing until a porter tripped over him in the quad so anything's theoretically possible.  Hypothesis: Everett was missing  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise sets the scene for a chaotic and crowded party, mentioning several guests who were too drunk to mention, and implies that it's possible for someone to slip in and out unnoticed. However, it does not provide any information that would necessarily lead to the conclusion that Everett was missing.  The phrase ""Damn it all we didn't even notice Everett was missing"" is actually a commentary on the chaotic atmosphere and the lack of attention to detail, rather than an admission that Everett was missing. It's possible that the speaker simply didn't notice Everett's absence, or that they were too caught up in the party to pay attention.  The fact that a porter tripped over Everett in the quad later on is presented as an isolated incident, and it's not explicitly stated that this is related to Everett's disappearance. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis that Everett was missing."	189	
1760460037	1760460038	Premise: His hair was white, as my daughters reported when they went to view the body before it was given to the Odonata. Now he is known as The Man Who Changed the World, and there are statues to him everywhere. No one remembers he had a younger brother.  Hypothesis: The Man Who Changed the World had a younger brother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that ""His hair was white, as my daughters reported when they went to view the body before it was given to the Odonata."" This statement provides information about the Man Who Changed the World's physical appearance, specifically his hair color. However, it does not mention anything about a younger brother.  The hypothesis, ""The Man Who Changed the World had a younger brother,"" is an additional statement that is not supported by the premise. The premise only provides information about the Man Who Changed the World's appearance, while the hypothesis introduces a new piece of information that is not present in the premise.  To make the premise entail the hypothesis, the statement about the hair color would need to be connected to the idea of a younger brother, such as: ""The Man Who Changed the World's younger brother had a distinctive feature that was also white, which is why the Man Who Changed the World was known as The Man Who Changed the World."" In this revised premise, the hair color would be related to the younger brother, making it entail the hypothesis."	226	
1760460038	1760460040	Premise: Oh, I did, I did! I was lucky. I would have liked brothers and sisters but I don't remember that I was ever lonely.  Hypothesis: she was ever lonely  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states: ""Oh, I did, I did! I was lucky. I would have liked brothers and sisters but I don't remember that I was ever lonely.""  The premise implies that the speaker had siblings, but it doesn't provide any information about the speaker's feelings or experiences with loneliness. The speaker's statement about not remembering being lonely is presented as a curiosity, not as a conclusion drawn from their experiences.  The hypothesis ""she was ever lonely"" seems to be a misprint or an error in the text. It should likely be ""I was ever lonely"" to make sense in the context of the premise. If the correct hypothesis were ""I was ever lonely,"" then the premise would entail it, as the speaker explicitly states they don't remember being lonely."	170	
1760460040	1760460041	Premise: Her priggishness. I admire it. I know she does wrong things she tries to organize other people's lives she can't see Mr Knightley is a man in a million.  Hypothesis: Mr Knightley is a man in a million  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that the speaker admires someone's priggishness and believes that person tries to organize other people's lives, but it does not provide any information about Mr. Knightley. The hypothesis claims that Mr. Knightley is a man in a million, which is a metaphorical expression meaning he is exceptional or extraordinary. There is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis, and the premise does not provide any evidence to support the hypothesis.	104	
1760460041	1760460042	Premise: Only she herself knew the evil thoughts she had and how effortlessly they could be translated into action. ``I 'll make a cup of tea.'' No she would not tell Peter that the person he loved most in the world was dead.  Hypothesis: the person Peter loved most in the world was dead  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise does entail the hypothesis. Here's why:  In the given premise, it states that ""the person he loved most in the world was dead."" This statement directly supports the hypothesis that the person Peter loved most in the world is indeed dead.  The phrase ""Only she herself knew"" implies that the person making the statement is the person Peter loved most in the world, and the fact that she knows this is a crucial detail. The use of ""she"" instead of ""he"" suggests that the person Peter loved is a woman.  The fact that she is able to carry out the action of making a cup of tea without revealing the truth about Peter's loved one indicates that she is not motivated by guilt or remorse, which would be expected if she were trying to keep the truth from Peter. This further supports the idea that she is the person Peter loved, and that she knows the truth about his loved one's demise.  Therefore, the premise directly implies that the hypothesis is true: the person Peter loved most in the world is indeed dead."	215	
1760460042	1760460044	Premise: ``It's not your day, is it, dear?'' ``No, but they 've got to be done, and Shirley's making the tea.'' Ianthe had not told her mother that she sometimes had to dust the books in the library.  Hypothesis: Ianthe sometimes had to dust the books in the library  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Ianthe's mother says ""No, but they've got to be done, and Shirley's making the tea."" This implies that Ianthe's mother is assigning tasks to Ianthe, but it does not necessarily mean that Ianthe is responsible for dusting the books in the library. The mention of Shirley making tea suggests that there is another person involved in the task, and Ianthe's mother may be assigning other tasks to her, not just dusting the books.  The hypothesis is too specific and assumes that Ianthe is the one dusting the books, which is not explicitly stated in the premise. The premise only mentions that Ianthe's mother has assigned tasks, but it does not specify what those tasks are or who is responsible for each one. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	178	
1760460044	1760460045	Premise: He pulled occasionally, his arms tiring. Conker slowed a little, but the branches were coming too fast, he had to lean right forward and couldn't use his hands. He remembered the gate at the end of the track had time to hope it was open because he didn't think Conker could jump it.  Hypothesis: Conker could jump the gate  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   In the premise, Conker is struggling to navigate the branches and is concerned about not being able to jump the gate at the end of the track. However, the hypothesis states that Conker ""could jump the gate"", which is the opposite of the premise. The premise suggests that Conker is unlikely to be able to jump the gate, while the hypothesis asserts that he can. The two statements are mutually exclusive, so the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	104	
1760460045	1760460046	Premise: But he ended up eating it himself. I was reluctant to kiss my mother, afraid that somehow her weakness and unhappiness would infect me. Naturally I didn't think for a minute that my life and spirit could stimulate her.  Hypothesis: her life and spirit could stimulate her mother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the narrator was reluctant to kiss their mother because they were afraid of her weakness and unhappiness infecting them. However, the hypothesis states that the narrator's life and spirit could stimulate their mother.  The premise only mentions the narrator's fear of their mother's weakness and unhappiness, but does not suggest that the narrator's own life and spirit have any potential to stimulate their mother. In fact, the premise suggests the opposite: the narrator is afraid of their mother's weakness and unhappiness having a negative effect on them, not the other way around.  The hypothesis introduces a new idea that is not supported by the premise. To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to provide some connection between the narrator's life and spirit and their mother's, such as a statement that suggests the narrator's emotions or experiences could have an impact on their mother's life or spirit. As it stands, the premise does not provide any evidence for the hypothesis.	206	
1760460046	1760460047	Premise: ``Ely,'' I said (that was her name and the first time I 'd ever used it), ``I want to be free.'' She looked stunned. I don't think she 'd considered this.  Hypothesis: Ely had considered him wanting to be free  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Ely said, ""I want to be free,"" and that this was the first time she had ever used that phrase. However, it does not provide any information about what Ely's thoughts or intentions were before she made that statement. The hypothesis assumes that Ely had considered the idea of wanting to be free before speaking those words.  In other words, the premise only describes the external behavior (Ely's statement) but not the internal mental state or thoughts that led to that behavior. Therefore, we cannot infer that Ely had considered the idea of wanting to be free before speaking those words, and the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."	149	1.0
1760460047	1760460050	Premise: I'm sorry, I 've put you in an invidious position. If you're being run by Morton, he 'll want to hear all this. It won't do any harm but I 'd rather not give him food for thought because I consider him an idiot and I don't think he's capable of interpreting it correctly.  Hypothesis: Morton is capable of interpreting this food for thought correctly  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise states: ""I'm sorry, I 've put you in an invidious position. If you're being run by Morton, he'll want to hear all this. I'd rather not give him food for thought because I consider him an idiot and I don't think he's capable of interpreting it correctly.""  The hypothesis states: ""Morton is capable of interpreting this food for thought correctly.""  To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.  The premise implies that the speaker does not want Morton to hear the information because they think he's incapable of interpreting it correctly. This suggests that the speaker is aware of Morton's alleged lack of intelligence or ability to understand the information.  However, the premise does not necessarily entail that Morton is actually incapable of interpreting the information correctly. It's possible that the speaker is simply trying to protect Morton from the information, not because they believe he's incapable of understanding it, but because they think he might be hurt or offended by it.  The phrase ""I consider him an idiot"" is a subjective evaluation of Morton's character, and it's not necessarily a statement about his actual abilities. The speaker's intention is to convey their opinion, not to make a factual claim about Morton's cognitive abilities.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis that Morton is capable of interpreting the information correctly. The premise only implies that the speaker wants to protect Morton from the information, but it does not provide any evidence that Morton's actual abilities are limited."	315	
1760460050	1760460051	Premise: The big Norwegian shook his head, frowning. ``Jeg fonstAr ikke.'' I don't think he found Ward's accent at all easy and anyway like many foreigners he found it easier to speak English than to understand it.  Hypothesis: the big Norwegian found Ward's accent at all easy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""The big Norwegian shook his head, frowning. 'Jeg fonstAr ikke.'"" suggests that the big Norwegian did not find Ward's accent easy to understand, as indicated by the action of shaking his head and frowning.  However, the hypothesis ""the big Norwegian found Ward's accent at all easy"" is the opposite of what is stated in the premise. The premise explicitly states that the big Norwegian did not find Ward's accent easy, while the hypothesis claims that he found it easy.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise actually supports the negation of the hypothesis, i.e., it suggests that the big Norwegian did not find Ward's accent easy, which is equivalent to saying that he found it difficult or hard."	156	
1760460051	1760460052	Premise: You really don't know anything about me, do you, despite all that wallowing in my mind? As it happens I don't think I'm the right person to lead humanity into the future no.  Hypothesis: she is the right person to lead humanity into the future  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that you don't know anything about the person in question, and that you don't think you're the right person to lead humanity into the future. This suggests that the speaker has doubts about their own abilities and qualifications to lead.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the person in question is the right person to lead humanity into the future. This hypothesis is in direct conflict with the premise, as it implies that the speaker is aware of the person's qualifications and believes they are capable of leading humanity.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise only sets up a doubt about the speaker's own abilities, while the hypothesis asserts a positive claim about the person in question.	157	0.875
1760460052	1760460053	Premise: It's where the bands practise. I can't remember what band Petra's in, but I seen them practise once. They were OK but I didn't think they was brilliant.  Hypothesis: Petra's band was brilliant  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that you saw Petra's band practice and that they were ""OK but not brilliant"". This suggests that your personal opinion of Petra's band is mixed, and you didn't think they were exceptional.   The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Petra's band was ""brilliant"", which is the opposite of your initial assessment. Therefore, the premise and the hypothesis are not consistent, and the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	103	
1760460053	1760460055	Premise: She swallowed hard, unsure if she had the nerve to go ahead. The memory of the pain in Tara's eyes last night decided her. Did he really expect her to believe that Tara was only the housekeeper?  Hypothesis: Tara was only the housekeeper  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that the memory of the pain in Tara's eyes last night decided her to go ahead, which implies that there was something significant or traumatic that happened to Tara last night. This suggests that Tara's decision to go ahead is motivated by a personal or emotional reason, rather than a simple assumption about her role as a housekeeper.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Tara was only the housekeeper. This is a specific claim about Tara's identity or occupation, which is not directly supported by the premise. The premise only mentions Tara's decision to go ahead, but does not provide any information about her occupation or relationship to the speaker.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to provide more information that directly connects Tara's role as a housekeeper to the situation or decision being described. For example, if the premise stated ""Tara's role as the housekeeper was a crucial factor in her decision to go ahead"", then it would entail the hypothesis. However, as it stands, the premise does not provide sufficient information to support the hypothesis."	229	
1760460055	1760460057	Premise: If there are spirits at work at the time, they come only from yourself, not from the fume of the incense. Why should spirits aid living beings? What arrogance is it that drives people to believe they can have power over them?  Hypothesis: people can have power over spirits  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that if there are spirits at work, they come only from yourself, not from the fume of the incense. This implies that the spirits are internal, and their presence is not dependent on external factors like incense fumes.  However, the hypothesis states that people can have power over spirits. The premise does not provide any information about the nature of these internal spirits or their relationship with humans. It does not suggest that humans have power over them.  In fact, the premise seems to suggest the opposite: that humans are not in a position to control or dominate the spirits. The phrase ""arrogance"" is also used to describe the attitude of people who believe they can have power over spirits, implying that this attitude is misplaced.  Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are not logically connected, and the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	186	
1760460057	1760460059	Premise: Why should this topic matter? You talked about everything else as you usually do. Why should I feel Maelmuire is important?  Hypothesis: Maelmuire is important  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.  The premise is: ""Why should this topic matter? You talked about everything else as you usually do. Why should I feel Maelmuire is important?""  The hypothesis is: ""Maelmuire is important.""  The premise presents a question about why the topic of Maelmuire should be considered important, implying that Maelmuire has significance or relevance. The fact that the speaker usually discusses other topics suggests that Maelmuire is significant enough to warrant discussion.  However, the premise does not explicitly state that Maelmuire is important or that it has any particular characteristics that make it worthy of importance. The premise is more focused on the speaker's intention to discuss Maelmuire and why it should be considered important, rather than providing a direct justification for its importance.  Therefore, I would argue that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise only sets the stage for a discussion about why Maelmuire is important, but it does not provide sufficient information to conclude that Maelmuire is indeed important.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to provide more specific reasons or evidence that Maelmuire has characteristics that make it important. For example, ""Maelmuire is a crucial aspect of the ecosystem"" or ""Maelmuire has significant cultural or historical importance."" Without such evidence, the premise only sets the stage for a discussion, but it does not provide a basis for concluding that Maelmuire is indeed important."	327	
1760460059	1760460061	Premise: It is all very well, in these changing times, to adapt one's work to take in duties not traditionally within one's realm. But bantering is of another dimension altogether. For one thing how would one know for sure that at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected?  Hypothesis: at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise states: ""It is all very well, in these changing times, to adapt one's work to take in duties not traditionally within one's realm. But bantering is of another dimension altogether.""  The hypothesis states: ""at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected""  The premise does not entail the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise discusses the idea of adapting to changing times and the differences between work duties and bantering. It does not provide any information about the expectations of bantering in a specific situation. In fact, the premise seems to suggest that bantering might be something separate from work duties, which might not necessarily be expected in every situation.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to provide some indication that bantering is a common or expected form of communication in the context of the situation being referred to. For example, if the premise stated ""In these changing times, it's common to expect banter in professional settings"", then the premise would entail the hypothesis.  As it stands, the premise is more of a general statement about the importance of adaptability and the differences between work and bantering, without making any specific claims about the expectations of bantering in particular situations."	255	
1760460061	1760460063	Premise: But the horror of losing was as much to do with money as with pride. Biddy had never let them down, come without fail all through the bad weather, and now was giving Nails an intensive course on her own horse which - in terms of money - was worth another couple of hundred pounds. Yet surely she knew they had no way of paying should she demand it?  Hypothesis: they had no way of paying  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise and hypothesis are related, but they are not identical.  The premise states that the horror of losing was due to a combination of factors, including money and pride. It mentions that Biddy had never let them down and was giving Nails an intensive course on her own horse, which is worth £200. The premise implies that the loss is significant, but it doesn't explicitly state that they cannot afford to pay.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that they ""had no way of paying"". This is a stronger claim that implies a complete inability to pay, rather than just a financial burden.  The premise provides some indirect evidence for the hypothesis, but it is not a direct statement. For example, the fact that the horse course is worth £200 suggests that they may not have the money to pay, but it doesn't explicitly state that they are unable to pay. The premise leaves some room for interpretation, and it's possible that they might find a way to pay or that the loss is not as severe as initially thought.  Therefore, while the premise provides some supporting evidence for the hypothesis, it does not entail the hypothesis."	235	
1760460063	1760460064	Premise: I ducked so fast I wasn't sure whether he 'd seen me or not, but it gave me a prickly feeling just to imagine it, so I scuttled for the door and legged it up the spiral stairway three steps at a time, just in case. As I ran, I remember thinking stupid thoughts like. How did he know I was up here looking down?  Hypothesis: he was up there looking down  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the narrator ""ducked so fast I wasn't sure whether he'd seen me or not"", which implies that the narrator is uncertain about whether the other person has seen them or not. This uncertainty is a key aspect of the premise.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states ""he was up there looking down"", which is a specific and absolute statement. The hypothesis implies that the other person did indeed see the narrator from above, but the premise does not provide any information that would necessarily lead to this conclusion.  The premise does not entail the hypothesis because the narrator's uncertainty about whether they were seen or not is not necessarily resolved by the other person being ""up there looking down"". The narrator's uncertainty could be due to various reasons, such as the person not seeing them, the narrator's own misinterpretation, or other factors."	186	1.0
1760460064	1760460066	Premise: At the heart of the universe there is cruelty. We are predators and are preyed upon, every living thing. Did you know that wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds piercing the weak spot in their armour?  Hypothesis: wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that ""At the heart of the universe there is cruelty. We are predators and are preyed upon, every living thing."" This statement highlights the universal cycle of predation and predation in the natural world, implying that many living beings are both predators and prey.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states ""wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds."" This is a specific example of predation, but it does not necessarily follow from the premise. The premise does not mention ladybirds or wasps specifically, but rather makes a general statement about the natural world.  To make the premise entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to be modified to include specific details about wasps and ladybirds, such as: ""In the natural world, wasps are known to lay their eggs in ladybirds."" This revised premise would make the hypothesis a logical consequence of the premise."	192	
1760460066	1760460067	Premise: ``I wanted to tell you. But the Bookman asked me to keep our meeting a secret.'' How did you know I 'd met him?  Hypothesis: he had met the Bookman  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""I wanted to tell you. But the Bookman asked me to keep our meeting a secret"" does imply that you have met the Bookman, but it doesn't directly state it.  The premise only mentions that the Bookman asked you to keep the meeting a secret, but it doesn't provide any information about whether you have actually met the Bookman before. The fact that you're telling someone else about the meeting implies that you have indeed met the Bookman, but the premise itself doesn't provide conclusive evidence of this.  So, the hypothesis ""he had met the Bookman"" is not necessarily entailed by the premise. The premise only sets up a situation where the Bookman has asked you to keep a secret, but it doesn't provide any information about your prior relationship with him."	165	
1760460067	1760460069	Premise: She rubbed them away with an angry fist. She was a fool to let anyone get round her. How long before she learned that folk 'll always take advantage of weakness?  Hypothesis: folk 'll always take advantage of weakness  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that ""She rubbed them away with an angry fist"" and ""She was a fool to let anyone get round her. How long before she learned that folk 'll always take advantage of weakness?"" This implies that the speaker believes that someone has taken advantage of her weakness and that she has yet to learn this lesson.  The hypothesis, ""folk 'll always take advantage of weakness,"" is a general statement that is not directly supported by the premise. The premise only mentions one instance where someone took advantage of her weakness, and it does not imply that this is a universal rule.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to include more information that suggests this is a general truth, such as: ""She rubbed them away with an angry fist because she knew that folk 'll always take advantage of weakness, and she had learned that the hard way before."" In this revised premise, the hypothesis is directly supported by the language used, making it an entailment."	209	
1760460069	1760460071	Premise: At length she decided that there was nothing to be gained by worrying her. Probably there was some quite innocent explanation, which Roger Kenyon would give her when she returned the wallet - if, indeed, it were his. And yet why had his manner changed so abruptly when he learned that the girl whose hat he had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage?  Hypothesis: the girl whose hat Roger Kenyon had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the girl whose hat Roger Kenyon had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage, but it does not provide any information about whether the wallet was actually his. The premise only mentions that Roger Kenyon had rescued the girl's hat, but it does not confirm that he is the owner of the wallet. The hypothesis only addresses the ownership of the wallet, not the hat.  The premise and hypothesis are related, but they are not logically equivalent. The premise provides a scenario, while the hypothesis makes a specific claim about the ownership of the wallet. The premise does not provide enough information to entitle us to make that specific claim.  To make the premise entail the hypothesis, it would need to be revised to include information about Roger Kenyon's ownership of the wallet, such as: ""Roger Kenyon had rescued the girl's hat, and he was the owner of the wallet she was trying to retrieve."""	199	
1760460071	1760460072	Premise: Anna looked at Peter again and said to herself in a guilty whisper, ``Will he become even more difficult?'' She wondered if a stranger could tell that he was difficult, just by looking at him. Would such a person watching Peter now reading the prayers of Rite B in his level pleasant voice notice that resentment lay like his blood just under his skin because the life he had chosen had not turned out as he had expected it to?  Hypothesis: resentment lay just under Peter's skin  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Anna wondered if a stranger could tell that Peter was difficult by looking at him. It implies that Peter may appear pleasant to the stranger, but it does not provide any evidence that he is difficult. The premise also mentions that Anna thought Peter might become more difficult, but this is her own concern, not a statement about the stranger's perception of Peter.  The hypothesis states that resentment lies ""just under Peter's skin"", which implies that Peter is already aware of and experiencing resentment. However, the premise does not provide any information about Peter's emotional state, and Anna's concern about Peter becoming more difficult is based on her own observations of him, not the stranger's.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as there is no logical connection between Anna's observations of Peter and his emotional state."	178	
1760460072	1760460073	Premise: Jean was tough and liked to drink. She would endure for a long while yet. But what would she do when she realized that with things as they were she was on a life sentence not just a temporary suspension of essential pleasure?  Hypothesis: Jean was on a life sentence  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Jean is ""tough"" and likes to drink, and that she will ""endure for a long while yet."" However, it does not provide any information that would suggest she is on a life sentence. The phrase ""life sentence"" is a specific and concrete concept that implies a particular type of punishment, whereas the premise uses more general language to describe Jean's personality and behavior.  In order for the premise to entail the hypothesis, it would need to include information that directly relates to the concept of a life sentence, such as ""she was sentenced to life in prison"" or ""she has been given a life sentence for a crime."" As it stands, the premise does not provide enough information to logically imply that Jean is on a life sentence."	167	
1760460073	1760460075	Premise: ``Clever''. Klug means ``clever''. Would you say that Abie was clever?  Hypothesis: Abie was clever  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Let's break down the premise and hypothesis:  Premise: ""Klug"" means ""clever"".  Hypothesis: Abie was clever.  The premise states that ""Klug"" is a word for ""clever"", but it doesn't provide any information about Abie. It only defines the meaning of the word ""Klug"".   Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The hypothesis requires information about Abie's actual cleverness, which is not provided by the premise.  In other words, the premise is a definition of a word, while the hypothesis is a claim about Abie's behavior or characteristics. The premise does not provide any evidence or information that would support or refute the hypothesis about Abie's cleverness."	155	
1760460075	1760460075	Premise: The Susweca. It means ``dragonfly'' in Sioux, you know. Did I ever tell you that's where Paul and I met?  Hypothesis: Susweca is where she and Paul met  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that ""The Susweca. It means 'dragonfly' in Sioux, you know. Did I ever tell you that's where Paul and I met?""   This statement implies that the speaker has previously mentioned that they met Paul at Susweca, but it does not necessarily mean that Susweca is the location where they met. The speaker might be referencing Susweca as a place or a location that they are familiar with, but there is no direct connection between the definition of Susweca and the statement about meeting Paul."	123	
1760460075	1760460077	Premise: How do you know? she was going to ask, but his smile was answer enough. If DeVore said there was going to be a vacancy there would be a vacancy.  Hypothesis: there was going to be a vacancy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise states: ""If DeVore said there was going to be a vacancy there would be a vacancy."" This is a conditional statement, which is a type of argument known as a syllogism.  In a syllogism, the conclusion is logically derived from the premises. In this case, the conclusion is ""there would be a vacancy."" The hypothesis states ""there was going to be a vacancy,"" which is the antecedent of the conditional statement.  The conditional statement ""If DeVore said there was going to be a vacancy there would be a vacancy"" is an example of a ""material implication"" or a ""material conditional."" It is a logical statement that if the antecedent (DeVore saying there was going to be a vacancy) is true, then the consequent (there would be a vacancy) must also be true.  Therefore, the hypothesis ""there was going to be a vacancy"" entails the conclusion ""there would be a vacancy."" The hypothesis is sufficient to guarantee the truth of the conclusion.  In other words, if DeVore said there was going to be a vacancy, then there would indeed be a vacancy."	238	
1760460077	1760460078	Premise: She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked. Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit, then came out and was not very successful in finding a job to suit him. That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them.  Hypothesis: it was Edward's fault  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that Edward wasn't successful in finding a job after leaving the Engineers, but it does not imply that Edward's failure is his fault. In fact, the premise states that ""That wasn't his fault"" which explicitly suggests that Nenna believes Edward's failure is not due to his own actions. This suggests that the blame lies elsewhere, possibly with the Engineers or the job market.  The hypothesis ""it was Edward's fault"" is not supported by the premise. The premise presents a more nuanced view, where Nenna is sympathetic to Edward's situation and believes he is not solely responsible for his job search struggles."	138
