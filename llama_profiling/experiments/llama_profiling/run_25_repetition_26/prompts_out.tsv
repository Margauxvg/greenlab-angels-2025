1760579042	1760579043	Premise: It was a complex language. Not written down but handed down. One might say it was peeled down.  Hypothesis: the language was peeled down  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states: ""It was a complex language. Not written down but handed down.""  This premise provides some information about the language, but it doesn't provide any direct connection or logical implication to the hypothesis ""the language was peeled down.""  In fact, the word ""handed down"" typically implies a process of transmission from one person to another, often through spoken or oral means, which is the opposite of ""peeled down,"" which implies a reduction or simplification of something.  Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are not logically connected, and the hypothesis is not necessarily supported by the premise."	134
1760579043	1760579044	Premise: It is part of their religion, a religion I do not scoff at as it holds many elements which match our own even though it lacks the truth of ours. At one of their great festivals they have the ritual of driving out the devils from their bodies. First the drummers come on - I may say that no women are allowed to take part in this ritual and the ladies here will perhaps agree with me that they are fortunate in that omission.  Hypothesis: no women are allowed to take part in this ritual  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that ""no women are allowed to take part in this ritual"" is not mentioned, but rather that ""the ladies here will perhaps agree with me that they are fortunate in that omission"". This suggests that the speaker is making a comment about the societal norms or expectations of the women in this particular group or community, rather than stating a universal rule or prohibition.  In other words, the premise is saying that the women in this specific group may or may not agree with the speaker's statement, and it does not necessarily mean that no women are allowed to take part in the ritual in general. The hypothesis is a more specific claim about the ritual itself, whereas the premise is a comment about the societal attitudes or norms of the women in this particular group."	165
1760579044	1760579046	Premise: The Paris to Rouen railway was being extended to Le Havre, and the line cut straight through Dr Flaubert's land. Part of it was to be compulsorily purchased. You could say that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy.  Hypothesis: Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that the extension of the Paris to Rouen railway cut through Dr. Flaubert's land, and part of it was compulsorily purchased. This establishes a factual connection between the railway extension and Dr. Flaubert's land.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Gustave Flaubert was shepherded into a creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy. The premise does not mention anything about epilepsy, let alone its potential impact on Flaubert's life or work.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the two statements are unrelated and do not logically follow from each other.	140
1760579046	1760579047	Premise: Part of it was to be compulsorily purchased. You could say that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy. You could also say he was driven there by the railway.  Hypothesis: Gustave was driven to creative retreat in Croisset by the railway  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that part of Gustave's experience was compulsory, and he was either driven to Croisset by epilepsy or the railway. However, it does not necessarily imply that Gustave was driven to Croisset by the railway. The phrase ""driven there"" can be used to describe both epilepsy and the railway, and the premise does not rule out the possibility of epilepsy as the reason for his retreat.   The hypothesis is more specific and claims that Gustave was driven to Croisset by the railway, but the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support this claim."	127
1760579047	1760579048	Premise: Some of them, like for instance the farm in Connecticut, are quite small. If I like a place I buy it. I guess you could say it's a hobby.  Hypothesis: buying places is a hobby  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise and hypothesis are closely related, but the premise does not directly entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that some people buy places, such as a farm in Connecticut, and that if they like a place, they buy it. This suggests that buying places might be a common behavior among those who like them.  However, the premise does not explicitly state that buying places is a hobby. It only mentions that some people buy places and implies that they enjoy it, but it does not provide enough information to conclude that buying places is a hobby.  To entail the hypothesis, we would need additional information that explicitly states that buying places is an activity that people do for pleasure or enjoyment. The premise only provides a correlation between buying places and liking them, but it does not provide enough information to establish a causal relationship between the two.  Therefore, we can conclude that the premise does not entail the hypothesis.	183
1760579048	1760579050	Premise: Look, my dear, I'm not in my dotage yet, and I know I'm a grumbler and a complainer. You could say the only form of comfort I 've got are my complaints.  Hypothesis: the only form of comfort he has are his complaints  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise states that the speaker is a grumbler and a complainer, and that their only form of comfort is their complaints.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the only form of comfort the speaker has is their complaints.  Upon closer examination, we can see that the hypothesis is not necessarily entailed by the premise. The premise mentions that the speaker is a grumbler and a complainer, but it does not explicitly state that their complaints are their only form of comfort. The premise leaves room for other possible forms of comfort that the speaker might enjoy.  In fact, the phrase ""I know I'm a grumbler and a complainer"" suggests that the speaker may be aware of their tendency to complain, but it does not necessarily imply that complaints are their only source of comfort. The speaker may have other sources of comfort, such as relationships, hobbies, or personal achievements, that are not mentioned in the premise.  Therefore, the hypothesis is not necessarily entailed by the premise."	208
1760579050	1760579051	Premise: Then the silence in the Zoo became complete. Woil stared around him and then suddenly with a push of his wings raised himself into the air, turned, and landed ten feet away on the back of a green bench. Creggan could see that he was afraid and that his fear was making him terribly uncertain.  Hypothesis: Woil was afraid  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that Woil ""stared around him and then suddenly with a push of his wings raised himself into the air, turned, and landed ten feet away on the back of a physical object (a green bench)"". There is no mention of Woil being afraid. The premise only describes Woil's physical actions and does not provide any information about his emotional state.   The hypothesis ""Woil was afraid"" is an inference that requires additional information that is not present in the premise."	111
1760579051	1760579052	Premise: But, of course, that just wasn't possible. Her disappointment over Jonathan, which had driven her to France in the first place, had been relegated somewhere to the back of her mind. Now in retrospect she could see that marriage to him would have been a ghastly mistake and that her reaction to discovering that he had been seeing other women while he had been engaged to her had had far more to do with wounded pride than with a wounded heart.  Hypothesis: marriage to Jonathan would have been a ghastly mistake  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states that the protagonist's disappointment over Jonathan led her to travel to France, but now she realizes that her disappointment was due to wounded pride, not a wounded heart. This implies that if she had not been disappointed, she would not have traveled to France, and therefore, she would not have ended up in a situation where she would have had to consider marrying Jonathan. This suggests that her disappointment and subsequent actions (including possibly reconsidering the marriage) were a direct consequence of her pride being wounded by Jonathan's infidelity.  In other words, the premise establishes a causal relationship between her disappointment, her travel to France, and the consideration of marriage to Jonathan. The hypothesis, ""marriage to Jonathan would have been a ghastly mistake,"" is a logical conclusion that can be inferred from the premise."	177
1760579052	1760579054	Premise: Like now. The Community in Knockglen would defend Eve vociferously. Even some of the Sisters here in Dublin might see that the girl had a point.  Hypothesis: the girl had a point  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""Like now. The Community in Knockglen would defend Eve vociferously. Even some of the Sisters here in Dublin might see that the girl had a point"" entails the hypothesis ""the girl had a point"".  Here's why:  1. The word ""vociferously"" means to speak or argue strongly in support of something. The phrase ""would defend"" implies that the Community would strongly support Eve's cause. 2. The phrase ""Even some of the Sisters here in Dublin might see"" suggests that there is a possibility that some people, specifically the Sisters, might agree with Eve's point of view. 3. The phrase ""that the girl had a point"" directly states that Eve has a valid argument or perspective.  The word ""entails"" implies a logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis. In this case, the premise provides evidence that suggests Eve's point of view is being taken seriously and is being considered by others, which increases the likelihood that she actually has a valid point.  Therefore, based on the language and structure of the premise, it appears that the hypothesis ""the girl had a point"" is logically entailed by the premise."	245
1760579054	1760579055	Premise: ``They have to be crushed, Bobkins!'' So saying, she marched off down the gravel path, making the kind of crunching noise Robert had thought could only be produced by the BBC sound-effects department. As they rounded the edge of the building he could see that behind the house was a vast garden.  Hypothesis: behind the house was a vast garden  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that ""They have to be crushed, Bobkins!"" and describes the sound of crunching gravel as she walks down the path. It also mentions that she is marching, which suggests a sense of determination or urgency. However, the premise does not provide any information that directly supports the hypothesis that there is a vast garden behind the house.  The hypothesis is a specific claim that the vast garden is behind the house. To make a valid entailment, the premise would need to provide some evidence or indication that a garden is likely to be found behind the house, such as a description of a garden or a statement about the house being surrounded by a garden. The given premise does not contain this information, so it does not entail the hypothesis."	163
1760579055	1760579056	Premise: ``Do you mind if I use your phone?'' Ronni could see that Guido's brain was whirring.  Hypothesis: Guido's brain was whirring  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that Ronni could see that Guido's brain was whirring. However, this does not necessarily mean that Guido's brain was whirring. Ronni could be seeing something else, or even a trick of the light, that appears to be whirring. The premise only mentions that Ronni can see Guido's brain whirring, but it does not provide any information about what is actually happening inside Guido's brain.	106
1760579056	1760579057	Premise: ``Look, lady, give me a break. I just deliver the stuff, I don't interview it for the Sunday papers.'' He waved the paper at her and even at a distance she could see that it said very little.  Hypothesis: the paper said very little  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the paper says ""very little"", which suggests that it contains very little information. However, the hypothesis states that the paper says nothing at all. The premise does not rule out the possibility that the paper contains some information, it only claims that it contains very little.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to say something like ""The paper says nothing"" or ""The paper contains no information"". The current premise only makes a qualitative claim about the quantity of information, not the completeness of the information."	118
1760579057	1760579059	Premise: ``You 've heard something like that before. Haven't you, Jimmy?'' Jimmy had been shaken by those sounds more shaken than the others for good reason but Cardiff could see that he was unprepared to show it as he pushed himself away from the reception counter.  Hypothesis: Jimmy was unprepared to show he had been shaken  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Jimmy had been shaken by the sounds, but it does not imply that he was unprepared to show it. In fact, the premise suggests the opposite: that Jimmy is ""shaken"" and therefore likely to be upset, but he is ""unprepared to show it"" as he pushes himself away from the reception counter.  The word ""unprepared"" indicates that Jimmy is hiding or concealing his emotions, but it does not necessarily mean that he was unprepared to show them. The phrase ""unprepared to show"" suggests that Jimmy is choosing not to express his emotions, rather than being physically or emotionally unprepared to do so.  To make the premise entail the hypothesis, the text would need to use language that implies a direct connection between the two ideas, such as ""Jimmy was shaken and therefore unprepared to show it"" or ""Jimmy's shaken state made him unprepared to show it"". The current premise does not provide this connection."	208
1760579059	1760579060	Premise: It was Alan's idea. He made a sour kind of joke out of it, that they must wait until their wedding night. Carolyn agreed because she could see he meant it although she didn't understand why.  Hypothesis: Alan meant it  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  In the premise, it is stated that Alan made a ""sour kind of joke"" about waiting until their wedding night, and Carolyn agreed because she could see that he meant it, but she didn't understand why. This implies that Alan's joke was ambiguous or unclear, and Carolyn's agreement is based on her interpretation of his intentions rather than a clear understanding of what he meant.  The hypothesis states that Alan meant it, which is the opposite of the implication in the premise. The premise suggests that Alan's joke was unclear or open to interpretation, whereas the hypothesis implies a clear intention. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  In other words, the premise provides evidence for the hypothesis, but it does not guarantee that the hypothesis is true. There could be other possible interpretations of Alan's joke that are not captured by the premise."	183
1760579060	1760579062	Premise: And why bother to write anyway? What was there to say? Mary had some vague idea that Adam's parents might suspect he was down here and come to see him.  Hypothesis: Adam was down here  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""And why bother to write anyway? What was there to say? Mary had some vague idea that Adam's parents might suspect he was down here and come to see him."" does not entail the hypothesis ""Adam was down here"".  The premise provides some information about Mary's thoughts and concerns, but it does not provide any direct evidence or logical connection that would necessarily lead to the conclusion that Adam was down here. The premise only suggests that Mary had a vague idea that Adam's parents might be suspicious of his whereabouts, but it does not provide any information that would confirm or deny his presence.  In other words, the premise sets up a situation where Mary is uncertain or concerned about Adam's whereabouts, but it does not provide any concrete evidence or logical connection that would necessarily lead to the conclusion that Adam was indeed down here.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to provide more direct evidence or logical connection, such as:  * ""Mary saw Adam's parents searching for him or heard them mention his name."" * ""Adam's parents had been asking questions about his whereabouts."" * ""Mary had evidence that Adam was hiding or had left a trail that suggested he was in this location.""  Without such evidence, the premise only sets up a scenario where Mary might be concerned about Adam's whereabouts, but it does not necessarily imply that Adam was down here."	278
1760579062	1760579064	Premise: ``And you're not having this dress,'' Nora said, bending down to look at the price tag. ``It's two and a half guineas!'' she hissed at Louise who could tell that she was genuinely appalled.  Hypothesis: Nora was genuinely appalled  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""And you're not having this dress,"" Nora said, bending down to look at the price tag. ""It's two and a half guineas! she hissed at Louise who could tell that she was genuinely appalled"" entails the hypothesis that Nora was genuinely appalled.  The reason for this is that the phrase ""she could tell that she was genuinely appalled"" is a direct explanation of why Nora reacted the way she did. It explicitly states that Nora's reaction is a result of her genuine appallment. This phrase is often referred to as a ""self-referential sentence"" or ""self-referential explanation"", where the hypothesis is explicitly stated within the premise.  In other words, the premise is not just stating that Nora was appalled, but also explaining why she was appalled, which makes it a strong indication that the hypothesis is correct."	180
1760579064	1760579065	Premise: She said good morning to Alice and Alice said hallo. She was thin and rather tall with a very lined gentle face and hair that was white but which Alice could see had once been blonde. She could also have told this was Tina's mother before Mrs Darne went off down the passage that led to the Headmaster's Flat.  Hypothesis: this was Tina's mother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Alice said ""hallo"" to Tina's mother, but it does not explicitly state that Tina's mother is the one Alice said ""hallo"" to. The premise only provides a description of the person Alice said ""hallo"" to, but it does not establish a connection between Alice and Tina's mother.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to include information that directly links Alice's greeting to Tina's mother, such as ""Alice said 'hallo' to Tina's mother"" or ""The person Alice greeted was Tina's mother."" The current premise only provides a description of the person and Alice's greeting, but does not make any explicit connection between the two."	154
1760579065	1760579067	Premise: She might have sat all afternoon, nibbling and stuporous, exhausted but not sleepy. But the glazier finally came down from the upper floor, cheerfully announcing that all was now right and tight and he would be on his way. Maggie could tell that he would have liked to stop for a chat that he felt sorry for her left on her own but she lacked either her grandmother's grace or her mother's energy so she did not offer him tea.  Hypothesis: the glazier would have liked to stop for a chat  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise does entail the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states that the glazier ""finally came down from the upper floor, cheerfully announcing that all was now right and tight and he would be on his way."" The use of the word ""cheerfully"" suggests that the glazier is in a good mood, which implies that he is happy to have finished his work and is looking forward to leaving.  The phrase ""he would have liked to stop for a chat"" is a conditional clause that is directly linked to the previous sentence. The use of the verb ""would have liked to"" indicates that the glazier's desire to stop for a chat is a consequence of his cheerful mood and his desire to spend more time with Maggie. This suggests that the glazier's cheerful demeanor is a direct cause of his desire to chat.  Furthermore, the fact that Maggie ""lacked either her grandmother's grace or her mother's energy"" implies that the glazier has a positive impression of Maggie's family, and therefore would be more likely to want to spend time with her. This further supports the idea that the glazier would have liked to stop for a chat.  Overall, the premise provides sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that the glazier would have liked to stop for a chat, given his cheerful demeanor and his positive impression of Maggie."	282
1760579067	1760579069	Premise: Jim waited. He waited a long time, and when the young doctor finally came out, it was almost dark. Jim could nonetheless tell by his anxious face that something was wrong.  Hypothesis: something was wrong  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Jim waited a long time, and when the young doctor finally came out, it was almost dark. It also mentions that the doctor's anxious face suggests that something was wrong. However, the premise does not provide any direct evidence that the doctor's anxiety is related to the fact that it was almost dark.  The hypothesis states that ""something was wrong"", which is a very broad statement. The premise only mentions the doctor's anxious face, which could be due to many reasons other than the fact that it was almost dark. The time of day and the doctor's emotional state are not necessarily connected.  To make the premise entail the hypothesis, we would need more information that links the time of day and the doctor's anxious face to the presence of a problem. For example, the premise could state that the doctor had just received some bad news or that there was a fire in the hospital, which would make it more likely that the doctor's anxious face is related to the fact that it was almost dark."	218
1760579069	1760579070	Premise: ``Yes?'' ``Nathan?'' He could tell it was long-distance the line was so gravelly and hollow but he didn't recognise the voice.  Hypothesis: the call was long-distance  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that ""He could tell it was long-distance the line was so gravelly and hollow,"" which suggests that the speaker is aware of the speaker's voice being distorted or of poor quality due to a long-distance connection. However, this does not necessarily imply that the call is indeed long-distance. The speaker could be describing a poor phone connection or a poor speaker's voice, regardless of the physical distance between the two parties.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to state something like ""He could tell it was long-distance the line was so gravelly and hollow"" (1) and ""The call was made over a phone line"" or ""The call was made from a long distance."" The revised premise would then entail the hypothesis."	164
1760579070	1760579071	Premise: Chopra stood unsteadily on his feet. The shapechanger bounded around with excitement. Chopra could tell something had happened.  Hypothesis: something had happened  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that Chopra stood unsteadily on his feet, and the shapechanger bounded around with excitement, and concludes that something had happened. However, the hypothesis is a general statement ""something had happened"", which is a conclusion drawn from the events described in the premise.  The hypothesis is not necessarily implied by the premise. The premise only describes Chopra's physical reactions, but it does not explicitly state that something had happened. The reader is left to infer that something had happened, which is where the hypothesis comes in."	119
1760579071	1760579072	Premise: It seemed impossible that anyone could endure such pain for so long, but at last the doors of the Renault slammed and there was comparative silence. The engine was started up, revving violently as the car was turned round on the narrow road. John could tell that it was being driven back up the hill towards Putna.  Hypothesis: the car was being driven back up the hill towards Putna  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that ""The engine was started up, revving violently as the car was turned round on the narrow road. John could tell that it was being driven back up the hill towards Putna."" This implies that the car is being driven down the hill, not up the hill, as the phrase ""turned round"" suggests a change in direction from going down the hill to going up the hill.  The hypothesis states ""the car was being driven back up the hill towards Putna"", which is a specific claim that is not supported by the premise. The premise only mentions that the car is being driven back up the hill, but it does not specify the direction towards Putna."	150
1760579072	1760579073	Premise: Just when you think you 've got it straight, along comes the Fool with his pig's bladder and whops you on the nose. By the way, I'm no idiot. I could tell Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see me at the airport.  Hypothesis: Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see her at the airport  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that ""Just when you think you've got it straight, along comes the Fool with his pig's bladder and whops you on the nose."" This sentence is unrelated to Gillian and Stuart, and it's unclear how it relates to the airport. The hypothesis, on the other hand, specifically states that Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see you at the airport. The premise does not provide any information about Gillian and Stuart's emotions or reactions, so it does not logically entail the hypothesis."	116
1760579073	1760579074	Premise: He's weird enough to have undressed me without thinking, according to some mad notion of the ``proper'' thing to do. Perhaps he thought I couldn't lie in bed with my clothes on.  Hypothesis: she couldn't lie in bed with her clothes on  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that the person undressed the speaker without thinking, but it does not provide any information about the speaker's behavior when lying in bed. The speaker might lie in bed with their clothes on, and the fact that someone else undressed them is not related to this behavior.   The hypothesis is an assumption about the speaker's behavior, whereas the premise is a statement about someone else's action. They are describing two separate events and do not logically follow one another.	107
1760579074	1760579076	Premise: That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort. Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all. But you will perhaps understand that there was a natural tendency on my part in asking what was after all a generous favour from my employer to hint that there was a good professional motive behind my request.  Hypothesis: there was a natural tendency on her part to hint that there was a good professional motive behind her request  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the narrator brought in tea for Mr. Farraday at a time when he was likely to be in a lighthearted and humorous mood, and that he tends to talk in a bantering tone with the narrator at such times. However, this premise does not provide any information about Miss Kenton's behavior or motivations.  The hypothesis states that there was a natural tendency on her part to hint that there was a good professional motive behind her request. The premise does not mention Miss Kenton at all, let alone her behavior or motivations. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise only discusses the narrator's actions and Mr. Farraday's likely mood, while the hypothesis is about Miss Kenton's behavior, which is not mentioned in the premise.	173
1760579076	1760579077	Premise: But don't dilly-dally for too long. Once it's published we are all going to look a little risible if we have made no adjustments to what is after all known as being predominantly my own design of gallery. Also I am a bit older than the rest of you but you can perhaps understand that I don't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation.  Hypothesis: he doesn't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise and the hypothesis are not the same thing.  The premise is a statement that sets the context for the situation:  ""But don't dilly-dally for too long. Once it's published we are all going to look a little risible if we have made no adjustments to what is after all known as being predominantly my own design of gallery.""  This premise is a warning about the potential consequences of not making adjustments to the gallery after it's published.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a statement that suggests a possible explanation for the situation:  ""Hypothesis: he doesn't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation""  This hypothesis is an explanation for why the person is making this warning, but it's not necessarily implied by the premise. The premise doesn't mention anyone wanting to drop dead, nor does it imply that recantation is the desired outcome.  The hypothesis seems to be an interpretation of the situation, rather than a statement that is directly supported by the premise."	212
1760579077	1760579079	Premise: I should dearly have liked to know whether they were Europeans or Americans, but I couldn't hear the accents. They appeared to be arguing. I hoped the white men weren't telling him to eliminate all witnesses because I don't believe it would have needed much persuasion.  Hypothesis: eliminating all witnesses would have needed much persuasion  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the speaker couldn't hear the accents of the individuals and assumed they were arguing, and that they were white men. It also expresses the speaker's skepticism about the possibility of the white men persuading someone to eliminate all witnesses.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that eliminating all witnesses would have needed much persuasion. The premise does not provide any information about the situation that would lead to this conclusion, and the speaker's skepticism about the persuasion is directed at the white men, not at the act of eliminating witnesses in general.  In other words, the premise sets up a scenario where the speaker is suspicious of the white men's intentions, but it does not provide any logical connection between the white men's accents, their argument, and the necessity of persuasion for eliminating witnesses. The hypothesis is not a logical consequence of the premise.	184
1760579079	1760579080	Premise: But the damage was done as far as my faith was concerned, which is probably why I went mad. So anyway, that Christmas Eve night confirmed my worst fears, it was like a kind of ``royal flush'' for the infant Jimbo. All three kings - Pa Santa and the King of Kings - all down the pan together... And to be honest I don't believe any of them stands a chance of ever making a comeback with me.  Hypothesis: any of the three kings stands a chance of ever making a comeback with him  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the speaker's faith was damaged, which led them to go mad, and that they don't believe any of the three kings (Santa, Pa Santa, and the King of Kings) can make a comeback with them. However, the hypothesis is a conditional statement that any of the three kings stands a chance of ever making a comeback with the speaker.   The premise explicitly states that the speaker does not believe any of the three kings can make a comeback, which directly contradicts the hypothesis. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.	124
1760579080	1760579081	Premise: He had seen something I should have, which was a car turning in from Soho Square and coming up behind me. My right foot hovered over the accelerator pedal and I balanced Armstrong on the clutch. I wasn't as convinced as Malpass that Nevil was out of harm's way.  Hypothesis: Nevil was out of harm's way  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that the narrator had seen a car turning in from Soho Square and coming up behind them, which suggests that the car is approaching the narrator. However, it does not provide any information about Nevil's location or situation. The hypothesis states that Nevil is out of harm's way, but the premise does not support this claim. In fact, it implies the opposite: the car is approaching, which could potentially put Nevil in harm's way.	106
1760579081	1760579082	Premise: Jed wondered. He 'd scarcely set eyes on him since the night they 'd had dinner together at the house in Westwood. Nobody had mentioned him either and Jed didn't feel he should ask.  Hypothesis: Jed should ask  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Jed had dinner with someone at a house in Westwood and that nobody had mentioned him since then. This creates a situation where Jed is curious and feels that it's only natural for someone to ask him about the person he had dinner with, but it doesn't necessarily imply that Jed should ask.  The hypothesis ""Jed should ask"" is a conclusion that can be drawn from the premise, but it's not a logical necessity. The premise only sets up a situation, and the decision to ask or not ask is left to Jed's discretion.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to include some explicit statement or implication that Jed should ask, such as:  * ""Jed had dinner with someone at a house in Westwood and everybody asked him about it afterwards."" * ""Jed had dinner with someone at a house in Westwood and it was a big deal that nobody had mentioned him since then.""  In the given premise, the situation is neutral, and Jed's decision to ask is left to his own judgment."	226
1760579082	1760579083	Premise: Yet what good came from knowing that a woman had killed herself? The children who had suffered a trauma would survive the experience, scarred by it and a little flawed by it. They would never forget that for a week they had imagined the act of murder had been committed.  Hypothesis: for a week the children had imagined the act of murder had been committed  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that a woman had killed herself, but it does not imply that the children suffered a trauma or imagined the act of murder. The premise only provides information about the woman's actions, while the hypothesis makes a claim about the children's psychological state and behavior.  In logic, an entailment relationship would require that the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. However, the premise does not provide any information about the children, and it is possible to imagine a scenario where the children were not traumatized or imagined the act of murder. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.	134
1760579083	1760579084	Premise: Nora calculated that there must be lots of single men up there so she decided it was ideal for the ``manhunt'', as we called it, even though the train fare was a serious consideration. I remember we went up to Euston together one Saturday morning, very excited, to buy the ticket in advance. It was a secret - if my parents had known she was going away alone they would have soon put the kybosh on it.  Hypothesis: Nora was going away alone  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Nora went to buy a ticket to a place where there are many single men, but it does not mention anything about her going alone. The hypothesis, however, assumes that she is going alone, which is not supported by the premise. The fact that her parents would have been upset if they knew she was going alone suggests that she is likely to be going with someone else, such as her friend.	96
1760579084	1760579085	Premise: His mother driving the car, so happy, young-looking and fashionably dressed and his father, a big, confident man in a smart suit, smiling and turning round to say something to Simon in the back seat. Marie thought of her own mother with her frumpy clothes and ageing, lined face. No one would have guessed that she was only forty-two.  Hypothesis: Marie's mother was only forty-two  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that the mother is driving, happy, young-looking, and fashionably dressed, but it does not provide any information about the age of the mother. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the mother is only 42 years old. The two statements are unrelated, and the premise does not provide any evidence to support the hypothesis.	81
1760579085	1760579086	Premise: ``I hope you are settling down and the cat is well.'' This was a lie. She did not hope the cat was well.  Hypothesis: the cat was well  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the speaker hopes the cat is well, but it does not guarantee that the cat is actually well. The speaker's hope is not a sufficient condition to ensure the cat's actual health. The speaker could be expressing a sentiment or making a polite remark, but it does not provide any information about the cat's actual condition.  In other words, the premise only expresses a sentiment or a desire, but it does not provide any evidence or information that the cat is indeed well. The hypothesis that the cat is well is not logically entailed by the premise, as there is no necessary connection between the speaker's hope and the cat's actual health.	145
1760579086	1760579087	Premise: Jane ate without pausing. Hunger was an unknown experience. She had never imagined it could actually hurt.  Hypothesis: hunger could actually hurt  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Jane ate without pausing and that hunger was an unknown experience for her, but it does not provide any information that directly links eating without pausing to the idea that hunger can hurt. The premise focuses on Jane's experience of eating without pausing and her unfamiliarity with hunger, but it does not imply that hunger is capable of causing pain.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to provide some information that suggests a causal relationship between hunger and pain, such as ""Jane's lack of pause while eating led to her experiencing pain due to hunger"" or ""Jane's unfamiliarity with hunger made her more susceptible to its pain"". The current premise only sets up Jane's situation, but does not provide any explicit connection between hunger and pain."	166
1760579087	1760579088	Premise: Miss Martindale had had a school, but her rigid ideas and stern manner had frightened the children, and their parents had taken them away. And gradually the school declined, until she had to give it up and retire to end her days in the white cottage with the inevitable cat as her only companion. Breeze had never imagined that digging was such hard work.  Hypothesis: digging was such hard work  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise states that Miss Martindale had to give up her school and retire to a cottage because of her strict teaching style, and that she is now left alone with her cat. It does not provide any information about the difficulty of digging.  The hypothesis, ""digging was such hard work,"" is an independent statement that is not implied or suggested by the premise. The premise mentions that Miss Martindale is digging, but it does not provide any information about the effort or difficulty involved in the activity."	114
1760579088	1760579090	Premise: ``You don't need to worry. We're quite adequately chaperoned. Rosa is a woman of strict moral principles.'' If she knows I'm in here she's probably hovering outside the door right now.  Hypothesis: he's in here  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Rosa is a woman of strict moral principles, and it implies that she might be hovering outside the door because she knows the speaker is in there. However, this does not logically entail that the speaker is indeed in the room. The premise only sets up a possible situation where Rosa might be outside the door, but it does not provide any direct evidence that the speaker is actually in the room.  In other words, the premise is a condition that makes it more likely that Rosa is outside the door, but it does not guarantee that the speaker is in the room. The hypothesis is a separate statement that needs additional evidence to be confirmed.  To make the premise entail the hypothesis, we would need to add more information, such as: ""If Rosa knows I'm in here, then I am in the room."" This would make the premise entail the hypothesis, as the presence of Rosa outside the door would logically imply that the speaker is indeed in the room."	208
1760579090	1760579091	Premise: I said you were mad to come over at this time. It's a world event. Don't you know that Venice is packed with visitors?  Hypothesis: Venice is packed with visitors  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that ""You said you were mad to come over at this time. It's a world event."" This implies that the speaker is expressing surprise or annoyance that the person arrived at a time when it's a special event. The word ""event"" is used to describe the reason for the surprise, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the event is a world event.  The hypothesis states ""Venice is packed with visitors."" This is a specific claim about the state of Venice, whereas the premise is a more general statement about the timing of the visit. The premise doesn't provide any information about the nature of the event, only that it's a reason for the speaker's surprise. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	162
1760579091	1760579093	Premise: And what she had said, and went on saying quietly, calmly, efficiently, was that she loved Maggie. She paid attention. At eight Maggie had not known that her grandmother was famous but she had seen that people had something in their manner when they looked at Rachel.  Hypothesis: Maggie's grandmother was famous  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Maggie's grandmother said that she loved Maggie, but it does not provide any information about the grandmother's public fame. The fact that people have a certain manner when they look at Rachel is also not directly related to the grandmother's fame. This information is more likely to be about the grandmother's personality, behavior, or social status, rather than her fame.  The hypothesis assumes that the people who have a certain manner when they look at Rachel are likely to be her fans or admirers, which would be a reasonable inference given that she is described as famous. However, the premise does not provide enough information to make this inference.  In order to entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to provide more information, such as ""The people who looked at Rachel in a certain manner were likely to be her fans or admirers"" or ""Rachel was a well-known public figure"". As it stands, the premise is too vague and does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis."	212
1760579093	1760579094	Premise: They 'd seen Miss Lavant on the promenade and about the town, always walking slowly, sometimes with a neat wicker basket. Kate had often thought she was beautiful. She hadn't known she was in love with Dr Greenslade who had a wife already and three children.  Hypothesis: Miss Lavant was in love with Dr Greenslade  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise states that Kate had often thought Miss Lavant was beautiful, but it does not mention anything about Miss Lavant's feelings or actions towards Dr. Greenslade. It simply presents a neutral observation about Miss Lavant's appearance. The hypothesis, on the other hand, implies that Miss Lavant is in love with Dr. Greenslade, but this is not explicitly stated in the premise.	92
1760579094	1760579095	Premise: Did he intend everyone in the castle to know he did not want the wife he had married in such a hurry? Did he intend to ignore her completely? Then Isabel saw Ellen's stunned face and realised that her maid at least did not know she had spent the night alone.  Hypothesis: Isabel had spent the night alone  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Isabel saw Ellen's stunned face and realised that her maid at least did not know she had spent the night alone. This suggests that Isabel did, in fact, spend the night alone, as she was aware of Ellen's unawareness of her actions.  The hypothesis states ""Isabel had spent the night alone"". However, the premise provides evidence that Isabel did spend the night alone, as evidenced by her awareness of Ellen's unawareness. Therefore, the premise directly supports the hypothesis, but it does not entail it. Entailment would require the premise to logically guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, whereas the premise provides indirect evidence that supports the hypothesis, but does not provide a direct logical connection.  To make the premise entail the hypothesis, it would need to be rephrased to include a logical connection, such as:  ""Isabel saw Ellen's stunned face and knew she had spent the night alone.""  This revised premise would entail the hypothesis, as the knowledge of the night spent alone is directly tied to the realization of Ellen's unawareness."	230
1760579095	1760579096	Premise: Most of them young, about his age, stood and talked and drank and laughed. The two girls he had noticed earlier were standing talking to some other girls. Graham hoped they all realised that just because he was standing talking to Slater that didn't mean he was gay too.  Hypothesis: Graham was gay too  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that Graham is standing and talking with some people, and that two girls he noticed earlier are standing with some other girls. It does not provide any information that would suggest Graham is gay. In fact, it even suggests that Graham is trying to alleviate the concern that people might assume he is gay because he's talking to two girls, implying that he might be interested in girls.   The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a specific claim about Graham's sexual orientation, which is not supported by the premise. The premise only provides information about Graham's social interactions, not his personal preferences or orientation.	135
1760579096	1760579098	Premise: He said that maybe I wasn't ready to join the Party just yet. Terry's passion for equality appealed to my purer mind, and his hatred of existing authority appealed to my resentments. But although I hated inequality it didn't mean I wanted to be treated like everyone else.  Hypothesis: he wanted to be treated like everyone else  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise describes the narrator's positive reactions to Terry's passion for equality and hatred of authority, which suggests that the narrator is drawn to Terry's values. However, the hypothesis states that Terry wants to be treated like everyone else, which is a contradictory idea. The premise implies that Terry's rejection of authority is what appeals to the narrator, not a desire to be treated like everyone else.  In other words, the premise suggests that Terry's independence and nonconformity are attractive to the narrator, but it does not necessarily imply that Terry wants to be treated like everyone else. Therefore, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise.	142
1760579098	1760579099	Premise: ``Oh, my poor Folly... We 've been together for five years, Lexy and I - she practically holds that company together. Of course I gave her an ``A''. But that doesn't mean I'm having an affair with her.  Hypothesis: he is having an affair with Lexy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that the speaker gave Lexy an ""A"" and that she ""practically holds the company together."" This implies that Lexy is an employee of the company, and the speaker is likely her supervisor or manager. However, it does not provide any information that would suggest an affair.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, implies a romantic relationship between the speaker and Lexy. There is no indication in the premise that the speaker and Lexy are in a romantic relationship, or that the ""A"" is anything other than an academic grade.  In logic, this is an example of a ""false disjunctive syllogism,"" where the premise presents two options that are not mutually exclusive, and the conclusion is drawn based on one of those options. In this case, the premise presents the possibility that the speaker and Lexy are in a romantic relationship, but the context suggests otherwise. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	208
1760579099	1760579101	Premise: Nevertheless, her heart sank at the thought of spending an evening with him in his present state of mind, and she was tempted to invent a sore throat in order to get out of it. But he had been very helpful over the Puddephat business, she admitted to herself, and his moods were unpredictable - he might be on top of the world by the time he arrived at the cinema. ``I'm still keen if you are '' she said brightly pretending she had not noticed anything was amiss.  Hypothesis: something was amiss  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the speaker's heart sank at the thought of spending an evening with him, implying that something is wrong with him, but it does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis that ""something is amiss."" The fact that she is tempted to invent a sore throat to get out of the invitation suggests that she is concerned about his well-being, but it does not necessarily imply that there is anything wrong with him.  The hypothesis ""something is amiss"" is too broad and assumes a more significant issue than what is actually suggested by the premise. The premise only indicates that the speaker is uncertain or uncomfortable about spending time with him, but it does not provide enough evidence to support a more serious claim that something is fundamentally wrong with him.  A stronger entailment would require more specific information, such as ""He had been acting strangely, ignoring his phone, and seemed distant, and his heart sank at the thought of spending an evening with him,"" which would imply that something is indeed amiss."	215
1760579101	1760579103	Premise: What must it be like to be imprisoned here, day after day, month after month? I wonder, does he keep them chained and manacled, thought Fenella, or does he use sorcery? And so utterly immersed was she in this strange blue and green land that was not feeling strange any more that she did not even notice that she was weighing sorcery against steel chains and seriously considering the likely outcome.  Hypothesis: Fenella was weighing sorcery against steel chains  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise does not entail the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise describes Fenella's thoughts and feelings about being imprisoned, but it does not provide any information about the physical state of her imprisonment. It does not mention anything about chains, sorcery, or any other form of restraint. The hypothesis, on the other hand, explicitly states that Fenella is weighing sorcery against steel chains, which is a specific and detailed detail that is not present in the premise.  To make the premise entail the hypothesis, it would need to include information such as: ""Fenella was chained in a damp, dimly lit cell with rusty iron bars, but she noticed a faint glow emanating from the walls, hinting at the presence of magic."" Or something similar, which would imply that Fenella is weighing the advantages and disadvantages of being chained versus being magically restrained. As it stands, the premise does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis."	193
1760579103	1760579104	Premise: Strasbourg, Vienna, Bucharest, Istanbul, not stopping, not looking back. I saw her tossing newly gauffred curls as the open roadster headed east, away from Ollie... Temporarily I managed to re-erect my jocular facade, but inside I was panicking. He could take her away I thought he could just do that he has such power to hurt me this little furry creature who hasn't even noticed that I 've given up the weed.  Hypothesis: he has given up the weed  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the narrator is leaving Strasbourg, Vienna, Bucharest, and Istanbul, and is heading east in a roadster, away from Ollie. It also mentions the narrator's inner panic and fear that Ollie might take someone away, but it does not specify who that someone is or what the context is.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, specifically states that Ollie has given up the weed. This is a new information that is not mentioned in the premise. The premise only mentions the narrator's fear that Ollie might take someone away, but it does not provide any information about what that someone is or what Ollie is doing with them.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as it does not provide enough information to support the specific claim that Ollie has given up the weed.	186
1760579104	1760579106	Premise: It - the tractor, the boys and the bulbs in the earth - knew she had chosen for them and was coming back to them. Of course there was still love, there was healthy, growing love and its name was called Work. She had fallen in love with it so slowly and gently and sweetly that she had never noticed it had happened.  Hypothesis: falling in love had happened  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  Here's why:  The premise states that ""She had fallen in love with it"" (Work), which suggests that the subject (she) has experienced a strong emotional attachment or affection towards Work. The use of the word ""fallen"" implies a sudden or unexpected event, which is consistent with the concept of falling in love.  Additionally, the premise mentions that this love was ""healthy, growing love"", which implies that the relationship between the subject and Work is positive and developing. The phrase ""it had happened"" further supports the idea that the subject has experienced a significant emotional event, which is a hallmark of falling in love.  The tone of the passage also suggests a sense of serendipity and wonder, as if the subject has only recently become aware of her feelings for Work. The use of words like ""slowly and gently"" to describe the development of her love for Work implies a sense of gradual realization, which is consistent with the experience of falling in love.  Overall, the premise sets the stage for a narrative that explores the emergence of romantic feelings, which is precisely what the hypothesis describes. Therefore, it can be inferred that the premise entails the hypothesis."	249
1760579106	1760579107	Premise: After the twelfth dot, two thirds of the way down the page, the transcript of this long session tails away into blank paper. I suppose what's happened is this. He has gone on staring out of the window thinking and she has gone on staring at him waiting with such absorption that neither of them noticed the tape had run out.  Hypothesis: the tape had run out  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. Entailment requires that the hypothesis must follow necessarily and logically from the premise. In this case, the premise provides a description of the situation, but it does not provide any information that would necessitate the hypothesis that the tape had run out.  The premise mentions that the tape had run out, but it also states that the tape had ""gone on staring out of the window thinking"" and she had been ""staring at him waiting with such absorption"" - suggesting that they were both engaged in conversation and lost in thought, and the tape was not even present. Therefore, the premise does not provide any logical connection between the tape and the situation described.  In fact, the premise seems to be describing a situation where the tape was not even relevant to the conversation or the situation, making the hypothesis that the tape had run out seem unlikely."	181
1760579107	1760579109	Premise: ``His name is Matthew Blake,'' Mandy informed Charity as they descended the steps from their cabin on to the paved pathway that led to the lodge. Thankfully she hadn't even noticed that Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt and was now wearing red shorts with her white silk blouse.  Hypothesis: Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise and hypothesis do not entail each other.  The premise states that Mandy informed Charity about her name being Matthew Blake as they descended the steps, which sets the scene and introduces the context. It does not provide any information about Charity's clothing.  The hypothesis states that Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt, which is a specific claim about Charity's clothing. The premise does not provide any information about Charity's clothing, and the change from the blue skirt to red shorts is not mentioned.  To entail, the premise would need to explicitly state or imply that Charity changed her clothing, such as: ""As they descended the steps, Mandy noticed that Charity had changed from her blue wrap-around skirt to red shorts."" The current premise does not provide this information, so it does not entail the hypothesis."	166
1760579109	1760579110	Premise: ``These ` ere smugglers is a dangerous bunch from wot I 've ` eard!'' ``If only we could devise a safe way of laying our hands on all that money,'' murmured Pugwash, whose greed was as proverbial as his cowardice. And the pirates were so busy discussing the problem and what they would do with the reward if they won it that they didn't notice that they were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage.  Hypothesis: the pirates were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the pirates were being observed from the window above by the new Mayor and his entourage. However, it does not provide any information that guarantees the hypothesis that the pirates were being observed by the new Mayor and his entourage.  The premise only mentions that the Mayor and his entourage were present, but it does not rule out the possibility that they were not the ones doing the observing. The hypothesis requires a causal link between the Mayor and the act of observing the pirates, which is not established in the premise.  In other words, the premise only sets the scene and establishes the presence of the Mayor, but it does not provide any information about his actions or intentions, which is necessary to support the hypothesis. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.	169
1760579110	1760579112	Premise: Ockleton, Morpurgo, Cornelius, Dysart and half a dozen others too drunk to mention. But there was so much coming and going that any one of us could have slipped out, pushed Everett through the window and slipped back again without being noticed. Damn it all we didn't even notice Everett was missing until a porter tripped over him in the quad so anything's theoretically possible.  Hypothesis: Everett was missing  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise does entail the hypothesis that Everett was missing.   The premise states that ""any one of us could have slipped out, pushed Everett through the window and slipped back again without being noticed."" This implies that it is possible for someone to have pushed Everett out the window and for it not to be noticed. The phrase ""without being noticed"" suggests that the event is plausible and could have occurred without anyone realizing it. This supports the idea that Everett is missing, as the premise explicitly mentions that he went missing.   Furthermore, the fact that the narrator and the others are too drunk to mention all the people who came and went, and the fact that the narrator says ""any one of us could have"" committed the act, suggests that the narrator is trying to downplay the possibility of Everett's disappearance, rather than directly admitting it. This implies that the narrator is aware that Everett is missing and is trying to avoid acknowledging it."	188
1760579112	1760579113	Premise: His hair was white, as my daughters reported when they went to view the body before it was given to the Odonata. Now he is known as The Man Who Changed the World, and there are statues to him everywhere. No one remembers he had a younger brother.  Hypothesis: The Man Who Changed the World had a younger brother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that ""His hair was white, as my daughters reported when they went to view the body before it was given to the Odonata."" This sentence implies that the person in question had white hair, but it does not mention a younger brother. The fact that there are statues to him and that he is known as ""The Man Who Changed the World"" are also not mentioned in the premise, and are therefore not relevant to the hypothesis.  The hypothesis ""The Man Who Changed the World had a younger brother"" is a separate statement that is not implied by the premise. The premise only provides information about the person's physical characteristics (white hair) and their death, but does not mention their family or siblings."	158
1760579113	1760579114	Premise: Oh, I did, I did! I was lucky. I would have liked brothers and sisters but I don't remember that I was ever lonely.  Hypothesis: she was ever lonely  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the speaker had brothers and sisters, but they don't remember being lonely. This suggests that the speaker may not have been lonely, or at least not to the extent that they remember. The fact that they mention having brothers and sisters implies that they had a supportive family environment, which could have alleviated feelings of loneliness.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the speaker was lonely. This is a stronger claim that requires more evidence or reasoning to support it. The premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis, so it does not entail it.	130
1760579114	1760579116	Premise: Her priggishness. I admire it. I know she does wrong things she tries to organize other people's lives she can't see Mr Knightley is a man in a million.  Hypothesis: Mr Knightley is a man in a million  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that ""Her priggishness"" (referring to Emma Woodhouse) ""admires it"" (presumably Mr. Knightley's character), and that she tries to organize other people's lives. However, it does not provide any information that would necessarily lead to the conclusion that Mr. Knightley is a ""man in a million"".  The phrase ""a man in a million"" is an idiomatic expression that implies someone is exceptional, extraordinary, or of high quality. However, there is no evidence in the premise to suggest that Mr. Knightley is exceptionally good or that he has any unique qualities that would make him a ""man in a million"".  The premise only mentions that Emma admires Mr. Knightley's character, but it does not provide any information about his personal qualities, accomplishments, or characteristics that would make him exceptional. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis that Mr. Knightley is a ""man in a million""."	210
1760579116	1760579117	Premise: Only she herself knew the evil thoughts she had and how effortlessly they could be translated into action. ``I 'll make a cup of tea.'' No she would not tell Peter that the person he loved most in the world was dead.  Hypothesis: the person Peter loved most in the world was dead  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the person speaking (referred to as ""she"") only knows the evil thoughts she has, but does not explicitly state that those thoughts are about Peter. The fact that she is considering making a cup of tea does not necessarily imply that Peter is the person she is thinking about.  In fact, the tone of the sentence ""I'll make a cup of tea"" is quite innocuous and could be interpreted as a neutral or even friendly action, without any malevolent intent. It is only when we consider the hypothesis that we start to imply a sinister motive, which is not supported by the premise.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as it does not provide enough information to logically conclude that Peter is the person the speaker is thinking about."	169
1760579117	1760579118	Premise: ``It's not your day, is it, dear?'' ``No, but they 've got to be done, and Shirley's making the tea.'' Ianthe had not told her mother that she sometimes had to dust the books in the library.  Hypothesis: Ianthe sometimes had to dust the books in the library  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Ianthe had not told her mother that she sometimes had to dust the books in the library. This implies that Ianthe might have told her mother that she had to dust the books in the library, or that she might not have told her mother about it at all. The fact that she hasn't told her mother doesn't necessarily mean she has to dust the books.  The hypothesis requires a causal relationship between the premise and the fact that Ianthe sometimes has to dust the books in the library. However, the premise only states that she hasn't told her mother about it, not that she actually has to do it. There could be other reasons why she hasn't told her mother, such as not knowing how to or not wanting to. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.	175
1760579118	1760579120	Premise: He pulled occasionally, his arms tiring. Conker slowed a little, but the branches were coming too fast, he had to lean right forward and couldn't use his hands. He remembered the gate at the end of the track had time to hope it was open because he didn't think Conker could jump it.  Hypothesis: Conker could jump the gate  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Conker ""couldn't use his hands"" and that the branches are ""coming too fast"", which suggests that Conker is experiencing difficulty navigating the obstacle course. However, it does not provide any information about Conker's ability to jump or his physical capabilities. The premise only mentions that he remembers there is a gate at the end of the track, but it does not imply that he will be able to jump it.  The hypothesis requires that Conker can jump the gate, but the premise does not provide any evidence to support this claim. The premise only sets the scene and describes the situation, but it does not make any explicit statements about Conker's abilities or his ability to jump."	155
1760579120	1760579121	Premise: But he ended up eating it himself. I was reluctant to kiss my mother, afraid that somehow her weakness and unhappiness would infect me. Naturally I didn't think for a minute that my life and spirit could stimulate her.  Hypothesis: her life and spirit could stimulate her mother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   In the given premise, the speaker is hesitant to kiss their mother because they are afraid that her weakness and unhappiness would infect them. This implies that the speaker believes their own life and spirit are strong and capable of resisting or not being affected by their mother's emotions.  The hypothesis, however, suggests that the speaker's life and spirit could stimulate their mother, which is the opposite of what is expressed in the premise. The premise states that the speaker is afraid of being infected by their mother's weakness and unhappiness, implying that the speaker's life and spirit are not capable of stimulating their mother, but rather are more resilient.  The premise and hypothesis do not logically follow from each other, as the premise implies a lack of influence or impact from the speaker's life and spirit on their mother, whereas the hypothesis suggests the opposite.	180
1760579121	1760579123	Premise: ``Ely,'' I said (that was her name and the first time I 'd ever used it), ``I want to be free.'' She looked stunned. I don't think she 'd considered this.  Hypothesis: Ely had considered him wanting to be free  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  In logic, an entailment is a relation between two statements where one statement implies the other. To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to analyze the meaning of the words and their relationships.  The premise is: ""Ely said (that was her name and the first time I 'd ever used it), 'I want to be free.' She looked stunned. I don't think she 'd considered this.""  The hypothesis is: ""Ely had considered him wanting to be free.""  The key issue here is that the premise mentions ""Ely"" (the subject of the sentence), but it does not mention ""him"" (the object of the sentence). The phrase ""him"" implies a male subject, which is not present in the premise. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Ely had considered ""him"" wanting to be free, as the premise does not provide any information about a male subject.  In other words, the premise only tells us about Ely's statement and her reaction, but it does not provide any information about who the person is that Ely is talking to or considering. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	250
1760579123	1760579124	Premise: I'm sorry, I 've put you in an invidious position. If you're being run by Morton, he 'll want to hear all this. It won't do any harm but I 'd rather not give him food for thought because I consider him an idiot and I don't think he's capable of interpreting it correctly.  Hypothesis: Morton is capable of interpreting this food for thought correctly  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise states that if Morton is being run by you, he will want to hear all this, but it doesn't necessarily imply that Morton will be able to interpret the information correctly. The premise only mentions that you don't want to give Morton ""food for thought"" because you consider him an idiot, which suggests that you think Morton is not capable of interpreting the information correctly.  However, the hypothesis states that Morton is capable of interpreting the information correctly, which contradicts your statement about Morton being an idiot. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  In other words, just because you think Morton is an idiot, it doesn't mean that he can actually interpret the information correctly. The premise only provides a reason why you don't want to share the information with Morton, but it doesn't provide any information about Morton's actual abilities or cognitive capacity."	175
1760579124	1760579126	Premise: The big Norwegian shook his head, frowning. ``Jeg fonstAr ikke.'' I don't think he found Ward's accent at all easy and anyway like many foreigners he found it easier to speak English than to understand it.  Hypothesis: the big Norwegian found Ward's accent at all easy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""The big Norwegian shook his head, frowning. ``Jeg fonstAr ikke.'' I don't think he found Ward's accent at all easy and anyway like many foreigners he found it easier to speak English than to understand it"" does not entail the hypothesis ""the big Norwegian found Ward's accent at all easy"".  The premise states that the big Norwegian found Ward's accent ""not at all easy"", but it does not state that he found it easy. In fact, it suggests that he actually had difficulty with it. The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that he found Ward's accent easy, which is the opposite of what the premise states.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to state that the big Norwegian found Ward's accent easy, for example: ""The big Norwegian shook his head, frowning. ``Jeg fonstAr ikke.'' I don't think he found Ward's accent easy, and anyway like many foreigners he found it easier to speak English than to understand it""."	209
1760579126	1760579128	Premise: You really don't know anything about me, do you, despite all that wallowing in my mind? As it happens I don't think I'm the right person to lead humanity into the future no.  Hypothesis: she is the right person to lead humanity into the future  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.  The premise states: ""You really don't know anything about me, do you, despite all that wallowing in my mind? As it happens I don't think I'm the right person to lead humanity into the future no.""  The hypothesis states: ""She is the right person to lead humanity into the future.""  The premise mentions ""you"" and ""I"" which suggests that the speaker is referring to themselves, but the hypothesis refers to ""she"". There is no logical connection between the speaker's self-doubt and the hypothesis, which is about someone else (she). The premise does not provide any information about ""she"" or her qualifications, abilities, or character, so it is not possible to infer that she is the right person to lead humanity into the future based on the premise.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	209
1760579128	1760579129	Premise: It's where the bands practise. I can't remember what band Petra's in, but I seen them practise once. They were OK but I didn't think they was brilliant.  Hypothesis: Petra's band was brilliant  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Petra's band was ""OK"" and you didn't think it was ""brilliant"". This suggests that you didn't have a very positive opinion of Petra's band, which is the opposite of the hypothesis, which claims that Petra's band was ""brilliant"".  In order for the premise to entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to express a positive opinion of Petra's band, such as ""I saw Petra's band and they were brilliant"" or ""I've seen Petra's band and they were fantastic"". The current premise does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis."	135
1760579129	1760579130	Premise: She swallowed hard, unsure if she had the nerve to go ahead. The memory of the pain in Tara's eyes last night decided her. Did he really expect her to believe that Tara was only the housekeeper?  Hypothesis: Tara was only the housekeeper  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the memory of the pain in Tara's eyes last night decided her to go ahead, implying that there is some sort of prior event or situation that has led to her making this decision. However, the premise does not provide any information that suggests Tara is the housekeeper.  In fact, the hypothesis states that Tara was only the housekeeper, but the premise does not provide any evidence to support this claim. The premise only mentions Tara's eyes and the decision she made, but it does not mention her profession or occupation.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to provide some information that links Tara's profession as a housekeeper to the decision she made. For example, if the premise stated something like ""Tara, the housekeeper, was visibly shaken by the events of last night and decided to go ahead"", then it would entail the hypothesis. But as it stands, the premise is too ambiguous and does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis."	210
1760579130	1760579132	Premise: If there are spirits at work at the time, they come only from yourself, not from the fume of the incense. Why should spirits aid living beings? What arrogance is it that drives people to believe they can have power over them?  Hypothesis: people can have power over spirits  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise states that spirits come only from within oneself, implying that they are a product of one's own thoughts, emotions, or energy. However, this does not necessarily mean that they can be controlled or harnessed to aid living beings. The premise is more focused on the origin of spirits, rather than their nature or behavior.  The premise does not provide any information about the relationship between spirits and living beings, or whether spirits can be influenced or controlled. Therefore, it does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that people can have power over spirits.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to provide additional information that suggests a causal relationship between spirits and living beings, such as:  * Spirits can be influenced by human thoughts or actions * Spirits can be commanded or controlled by humans * Spirits are dependent on humans for their existence or well-being  Without such information, the premise is simply stating a fact about the origin of spirits, but it does not provide any insight into their nature or behavior, and therefore does not entail the hypothesis that people can have power over them.	230
1760579132	1760579134	Premise: Why should this topic matter? You talked about everything else as you usually do. Why should I feel Maelmuire is important?  Hypothesis: Maelmuire is important  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise is: ""Why should this topic matter? You talked about everything else as you usually do. Why should I feel Maelmuire is important?""  The hypothesis is: ""Maelmuire is important""  To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.  The premise suggests that the speaker has been discussing various topics previously and is now asking why Maelmuire should matter. This implies that Maelmuire is a topic that has been discussed previously, and the speaker is seeking justification or explanation for its significance.  However, the premise does not explicitly state that Maelmuire is important or that it has any inherent value. The speaker's question is more focused on the speaker's own perspective and the listener's reaction to Maelmuire.  Therefore, I would say that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise provides some context for the discussion, but it does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that Maelmuire is inherently important.  In other words, the premise is more about the speaker's attitude and the listener's response, rather than the actual importance of Maelmuire itself."	244
1760579134	1760579136	Premise: It is all very well, in these changing times, to adapt one's work to take in duties not traditionally within one's realm. But bantering is of another dimension altogether. For one thing how would one know for sure that at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected?  Hypothesis: at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that it is ""all very well"" to adapt one's work to take in duties not traditionally within one's realm, but this is a statement about flexibility and adaptability in work. It does not provide any information about bantering or communication style.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, makes a specific claim about the nature of bantering, namely that at any given moment, a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected. This is a more specific and particular claim that is not necessarily implied by the premise.  To show that the premise entails the hypothesis, we would need additional information that links the two. For example, the premise could be modified to include a statement about the context in which the work is being done, such as ""In informal social settings, it is all very well to adapt one's work to take in duties not traditionally within one's realm."" In this revised premise, the hypothesis would be more likely to be entailed, as the context suggests that bantering is a common or expected form of communication in these settings."	229
1760579136	1760579138	Premise: But the horror of losing was as much to do with money as with pride. Biddy had never let them down, come without fail all through the bad weather, and now was giving Nails an intensive course on her own horse which - in terms of money - was worth another couple of hundred pounds. Yet surely she knew they had no way of paying should she demand it?  Hypothesis: they had no way of paying  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise does entail the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states that Biddy had never let them down and was giving Nails an intensive course on her own horse, which implies that Biddy had previously provided services to Nails. It then mentions that the course was worth another couple of hundred pounds, which suggests that Nails would be expected to pay Biddy for the course.  The premise implies that Biddy had a prior obligation to Nails, which is the foundation of the hypothesis that they had no way of paying. The hypothesis is a logical consequence of the information provided in the premise, and it is reasonable to infer that if Biddy had provided services to Nails in the past, Nails would be expected to pay her for those services, including the intensive course.  In other words, the premise sets up a causal relationship between Biddy and Nails, where Biddy has provided services to Nails in the past, and the hypothesis is a natural consequence of that relationship.	204
1760579138	1760579139	Premise: I ducked so fast I wasn't sure whether he 'd seen me or not, but it gave me a prickly feeling just to imagine it, so I scuttled for the door and legged it up the spiral stairway three steps at a time, just in case. As I ran, I remember thinking stupid thoughts like. How did he know I was up here looking down?  Hypothesis: he was up there looking down  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  In logic, a hypothesis is a statement that is tested or proposed to explain a phenomenon. The premise, on the other hand, is a statement that sets the context for the hypothesis.  In this case, the premise sets the scene for a situation where the narrator ducks and runs up the stairs, implying that something potentially threatening or ominous is happening. However, it does not directly state or imply that the person the narrator is running from is looking up at them.  The hypothesis, ""he was up there looking down,"" is a specific interpretation of the situation, but it is not necessarily supported by the premise. The premise only mentions that the narrator is running up the stairs ""just in case,"" but it does not provide any information about the person's intentions or actions.  Therefore, the premise and hypothesis are not logically entailed, meaning that the hypothesis is not necessarily true or implied by the premise."	194
1760579139	1760579141	Premise: At the heart of the universe there is cruelty. We are predators and are preyed upon, every living thing. Did you know that wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds piercing the weak spot in their armour?  Hypothesis: wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that at the heart of the universe there is cruelty, and that we are predators and are preyed upon, which suggests a general statement about the nature of the universe and the relationship between predators and prey.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, makes a specific claim about the behavior of wasps and ladybirds, namely that wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds. This claim is a specific observation or fact about a particular species, rather than a general statement about the universe or the relationship between predators and prey.  The premise sets the tone for a discussion about the darker aspects of nature, but it does not provide any information about the behavior of specific species like wasps and ladybirds. To make a logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis, additional information or evidence would be needed to show that wasps actually lay their eggs in ladybirds.	187
1760579141	1760579143	Premise: ``I wanted to tell you. But the Bookman asked me to keep our meeting a secret.'' How did you know I 'd met him?  Hypothesis: he had met the Bookman  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""I wanted to tell you. But the Bookman asked me to keep our meeting a secret"" implies that the speaker has a prior relationship or connection with the Bookman, and that they had a meeting with him.  The hypothesis ""he had met the Bookman"" is a reasonable inference based on the premise. The use of the word ""our"" in the premise suggests that the speaker and the Bookman have a prior relationship or connection, which is consistent with the idea that they have met before. Additionally, the fact that the Bookman asked the speaker to keep their meeting a secret implies that the speaker has some level of trust or confidence in the Bookman, which is also consistent with the idea that they have met before.  However, it's worth noting that the premise does not explicitly state that the speaker and the Bookman have met before, only that the Bookman asked the speaker to keep their meeting a secret. Therefore, the hypothesis is not a certainty, but rather a reasonable inference based on the available information.  To make the hypothesis more explicit, the premise could be rephrased to include additional details, such as ""I wanted to tell you about our meeting. But the Bookman asked me to keep it a secret"", which would make it clear that the speaker and the Bookman have a prior relationship or connection."	275
1760579143	1760579145	Premise: She rubbed them away with an angry fist. She was a fool to let anyone get round her. How long before she learned that folk 'll always take advantage of weakness?  Hypothesis: folk 'll always take advantage of weakness  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that the character ""rubbed them away with an angry fist"" and that she was a ""fool to let anyone get round her,"" implying that she has been taken advantage of or manipulated by someone. However, this does not necessarily mean that ""folk will always take advantage of weakness."" The premise only provides a specific instance of this happening to the character, and it does not make a general statement about the behavior of ""folk"" in all situations.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a general statement that makes a claim about the behavior of ""folk"" in all cases. The premise does not provide enough information to support this general claim, and it is not logically necessary to infer the hypothesis from the premise.   For example, the character may have been taken advantage of by a specific person, but it does not mean that all people will take advantage of her or anyone else. The premise only provides a specific instance, and the hypothesis is a broader generalization that is not necessarily true."	217
1760579145	1760579146	Premise: At length she decided that there was nothing to be gained by worrying her. Probably there was some quite innocent explanation, which Roger Kenyon would give her when she returned the wallet - if, indeed, it were his. And yet why had his manner changed so abruptly when he learned that the girl whose hat he had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage?  Hypothesis: the girl whose hat Roger Kenyon had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the girl whose hat Roger Kenyon had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage, but it does not necessarily mean that the girl whose hat Roger Kenyon had rescued is the one who lives at Sunset Cottage. The phrase ""the girl whose hat"" could refer to a different girl, and the fact that Roger Kenyon had rescued her hat does not imply that she is the one who lives at Sunset Cottage.  In other words, the premise provides two separate pieces of information: (1) the girl whose hat Roger Kenyon had rescued is going to live at Sunset Cottage, and (2) Roger Kenyon is the one who had rescued the girl's hat. However, the relationship between these two pieces of information is not causal or logical, and it does not entail that the two girls are the same person."	180
1760579146	1760579147	Premise: Anna looked at Peter again and said to herself in a guilty whisper, ``Will he become even more difficult?'' She wondered if a stranger could tell that he was difficult, just by looking at him. Would such a person watching Peter now reading the prayers of Rite B in his level pleasant voice notice that resentment lay like his blood just under his skin because the life he had chosen had not turned out as he had expected it to?  Hypothesis: resentment lay just under Peter's skin  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that Anna wonders if a stranger could tell that Peter is difficult just by looking at him. However, it does not provide any information about Peter's feelings or emotions, including resentment. The hypothesis states that resentment ""lay like his blood just under his skin"", which is a descriptive phrase that implies Peter actually feels resentment, but this is not explicitly stated in the premise.  The premise only mentions Anna's perception of Peter as difficult, but it does not provide any information about Peter's internal state or emotions. Therefore, we cannot conclude that resentment is a characteristic of Peter based on the premise."	133
1760579147	1760579149	Premise: Jean was tough and liked to drink. She would endure for a long while yet. But what would she do when she realized that with things as they were she was on a life sentence not just a temporary suspension of essential pleasure?  Hypothesis: Jean was on a life sentence  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states that Jean is ""tough and liked to drink"" and will ""endure for a long while."" However, it does not provide any information that suggests she is serving a life sentence. In fact, the phrase ""for a long while"" implies a relatively short-term duration, rather than a lifelong sentence.  The premise only mentions that Jean will ""endure,"" which could mean she will tolerate or withstand a difficult situation for a long time, but it does not imply that she is serving a life sentence. The hypothesis requires evidence of a life sentence, which is not present in the premise.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to include language that explicitly mentions a life sentence, such as ""Jean is serving a life sentence"" or ""Jean's drinking problem is a lifelong sentence."" Without this language, the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis."	196
1760579149	1760579150	Premise: ``Clever''. Klug means ``clever''. Would you say that Abie was clever?  Hypothesis: Abie was clever  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.  The premise states: ""Klug means 'clever'.""  The hypothesis states: ""Abie was clever.""  The premise establishes a general definition of the word ""Klug"", which is that it means ""clever"". However, it does not provide any specific information about Abie. The premise only defines the meaning of the word ""Klug"", but it does not make any claims about Abie's character, abilities, or intelligence.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The hypothesis requires specific information about Abie, whereas the premise only provides a general definition of the word ""Klug"". Without additional information, we cannot conclude that Abie is clever based on the premise alone."	168
1760579150	1760579151	Premise: The Susweca. It means ``dragonfly'' in Sioux, you know. Did I ever tell you that's where Paul and I met?  Hypothesis: Susweca is where she and Paul met  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that ""The Susweca"" means ""dragonfly"" in Sioux, and that it is where you met Paul. However, it does not provide any information about where Paul is from or how you met him. The hypothesis, ""Susweca is where she and Paul met,"" makes an assumption about the gender of the person you met (implying that it was a female), but the premise does not support this assumption.  In a logical entailment, the conclusion must follow necessarily and logically from the premises. In this case, the premise provides information about the name ""Susweca"" and its meaning, but it does not provide any information that would necessarily lead to the conclusion that the person you met is a female."	163
1760579151	1760579153	Premise: How do you know? she was going to ask, but his smile was answer enough. If DeVore said there was going to be a vacancy there would be a vacancy.  Hypothesis: there was going to be a vacancy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that if DeVore said there was going to be a vacancy, then there would be a vacancy. However, the hypothesis is that there was going to be a vacancy.  The premise only provides a conditional statement that links DeVore's statement to the existence of a vacancy, but it does not provide any information about DeVore's current statement or any other factor that could affect the situation. Therefore, the premise does not provide enough information to entail the hypothesis.  In other words, the premise is a conditional statement that only guarantees the existence of a vacancy if DeVore makes a certain statement, but it does not guarantee that DeVore will make that statement or that the statement is true. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a statement about the current situation, which is not supported by the premise.	177
1760579153	1760579154	Premise: She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked. Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit, then came out and was not very successful in finding a job to suit him. That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them.  Hypothesis: it was Edward's fault  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that Edward wasn't very successful in finding a job after leaving the Engineers, and Nenna feels that it's not his fault. However, it doesn't explicitly state that Edward's lack of job success is a result of his own actions or decisions, which is what the hypothesis suggests. The premise only mentions that Edward wasn't very successful, but doesn't provide any information about the reasons behind this success (or lack thereof).   In order for the premise to entail the hypothesis, there would need to be a clear connection between Edward's actions (or lack thereof) and his job search results. The premise only implies that Nenna thinks Edward's success (or lack thereof) is not his fault, but it doesn't provide any evidence to support this claim.	167
