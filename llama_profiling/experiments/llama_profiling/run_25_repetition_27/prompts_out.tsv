1760489126	1760489127	Premise: It was a complex language. Not written down but handed down. One might say it was peeled down.  Hypothesis: the language was peeled down  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states: ""It was a complex language. Not written down but handed down.""  This premise provides some information about the language, stating that it is complex and has been passed down orally, but it does not provide any information that directly supports the hypothesis that the language was ""peeled down"".  The term ""peeled down"" is not a common idiomatic expression, and it's unclear what it would mean for a language to be ""peeled down"". In contrast, the premise does not provide any context that would suggest this meaning.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to provide more information that directly supports the idea that the language was ""peeled down"", such as ""the language was simplified or reduced to its core elements"" or ""the language was stripped of its complexities"". As it stands, the premise is insufficient to entail the hypothesis."	188	1.0
1760489127	1760489128	Premise: It is part of their religion, a religion I do not scoff at as it holds many elements which match our own even though it lacks the truth of ours. At one of their great festivals they have the ritual of driving out the devils from their bodies. First the drummers come on - I may say that no women are allowed to take part in this ritual and the ladies here will perhaps agree with me that they are fortunate in that omission.  Hypothesis: no women are allowed to take part in this ritual  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that ""no women are allowed to take part in this ritual"" is not explicitly mentioned. Instead, it is mentioned that ""the ladies here will perhaps agree"" with the statement that no women are allowed to take part in the ritual. This implies that the ladies may or may not agree, but it does not confirm that no women are allowed to take part in the ritual.  The ladies' agreement or disagreement does not necessarily imply that the rule of excluding women from the ritual is absolute or universally true for the entire group. The ladies may be part of a subgroup or faction within the larger group that allows women to participate, or they may be unaware of the rule. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	159	
1760489128	1760489130	Premise: The Paris to Rouen railway was being extended to Le Havre, and the line cut straight through Dr Flaubert's land. Part of it was to be compulsorily purchased. You could say that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy.  Hypothesis: Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise states that the Paris to Rouen railway was extended to Le Havre, and the line cut straight through Dr. Flaubert's land, and part of it was to be compulsorily purchased. This implies that Dr. Flaubert's land was affected by the railway extension, and it may have caused him stress or discomfort.  The hypothesis states that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy.  The hypothesis introduces epilepsy as the cause of Dr. Flaubert's retreat to Croisset. However, the premise does not provide any information about Dr. Flaubert's health or epilepsy. The premise only mentions the construction of the railway and its impact on Dr. Flaubert's land.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise provides a circumstance that may have led to Dr. Flaubert's retreat, but it does not specify the reason for the retreat, which is epilepsy.	196	
1760489130	1760489131	Premise: Part of it was to be compulsorily purchased. You could say that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy. You could also say he was driven there by the railway.  Hypothesis: Gustave was driven to creative retreat in Croisset by the railway  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that ""Part of it was to be compulsorily purchased"" and ""You could say that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy."" This suggests that the compulsory purchase of part of something (likely land or property) and Gustave's epilepsy may have contributed to his being sent to Croisset.  However, the hypothesis states that Gustave was driven to creative retreat in Croisset by the railway. The premise does not mention the railway, and the connection between the railway and Gustave's situation is not explicitly stated. The mention of the railway is a separate idea that is not implied by the premise.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the two ideas are not logically connected."	163	
1760489131	1760489133	Premise: Some of them, like for instance the farm in Connecticut, are quite small. If I like a place I buy it. I guess you could say it's a hobby.  Hypothesis: buying places is a hobby  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise states: ""Some of them, like for instance the farm in Connecticut, are quite small. If I like a place I buy it.""  This premise suggests that the speaker has purchased at least one property, but it does not necessarily imply that buying places is a hobby for the speaker. The use of ""if I like a place I buy it"" is a conditional statement, which means that buying a place is not necessarily a regular or common activity for the speaker. The phrase ""some of them"" also implies that the speaker has not purchased many places, but rather only a few.  Furthermore, the phrase ""like for instance"" is a non-committal phrase that does not necessarily indicate that the speaker enjoys buying places. It's more of a casual example to illustrate the point being made.  Therefore, I would say that the premise does not entail the hypothesis that buying places is a hobby. The premise only suggests that the speaker has bought a few places, but it does not provide enough information to conclude that buying places is a regular or enjoyable activity for the speaker."	219	
1760489133	1760489134	Premise: Look, my dear, I'm not in my dotage yet, and I know I'm a grumbler and a complainer. You could say the only form of comfort I 've got are my complaints.  Hypothesis: the only form of comfort he has are his complaints  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise does entail the hypothesis.  Here's why:  * The premise states that the speaker is ""not in my dotage yet"", which implies that the speaker is still young or relatively old but not yet elderly. * The premise then states that the speaker knows they are a ""grumbler and a complainer"", which suggests that they have a tendency to complain. * The premise concludes by stating that ""the only form of comfort I've got are my complaints"", which directly supports the hypothesis that the speaker's complaints are their source of comfort.  The hypothesis is essentially a summary of the information presented in the premise, and it accurately reflects the speaker's character as described. Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis."	147	
1760489134	1760489136	Premise: Then the silence in the Zoo became complete. Woil stared around him and then suddenly with a push of his wings raised himself into the air, turned, and landed ten feet away on the back of a green bench. Creggan could see that he was afraid and that his fear was making him terribly uncertain.  Hypothesis: Woil was afraid  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Woil ""stared around him and then suddenly with a push of his wings raised himself into the air, turned, and landed ten feet away on the back of a physical object (a green bench)"". This suggests that Woil is capable of flight, and his actions imply that he is capable of lifting himself into the air and landing on a solid object.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Woil was afraid, which is not directly supported by the premise. The premise only mentions that Creggan could see that Woil was afraid, but this is reported by Creggan, not Woil himself. The premise does not provide any information about Woil's emotions or mental state.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as there is no direct evidence in the premise to support the claim that Woil is afraid."	189	
1760489136	1760489137	Premise: But, of course, that just wasn't possible. Her disappointment over Jonathan, which had driven her to France in the first place, had been relegated somewhere to the back of her mind. Now in retrospect she could see that marriage to him would have been a ghastly mistake and that her reaction to discovering that he had been seeing other women while he had been engaged to her had had far more to do with wounded pride than with a wounded heart.  Hypothesis: marriage to Jonathan would have been a ghastly mistake  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that her disappointment over Jonathan had driven her to France, but it does not imply that she was disappointed with Jonathan himself or that she would have regretted marrying him. In fact, the premise suggests that her disappointment was more related to her own pride, and that she had been foolish to consider marrying him in the first place.  The hypothesis requires a causal link between the premise and the conclusion, but the premise only establishes a correlation between her disappointment and her decision to go to France, without implying that the marriage itself would have been a mistake.  The conclusion is actually the opposite of what is implied in the premise. The premise suggests that she might have been better off not marrying Jonathan, but it does not explicitly state that she would have regretted it. The hypothesis requires a stronger causal link than what is provided in the premise.	182	
1760489137	1760489139	Premise: Like now. The Community in Knockglen would defend Eve vociferously. Even some of the Sisters here in Dublin might see that the girl had a point.  Hypothesis: the girl had a point  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the Community in Knockglen would defend Eve vociferously, and that some of the Sisters in Dublin might see that the girl had a point. This suggests that the defense of Eve is likely to be vigorous and that some people may acknowledge the validity of her argument.  However, the hypothesis states that the girl had a point, which is a more specific claim about the content of Eve's argument. The premise does not provide any information about the validity or substance of Eve's argument, only that it is being defended vigorously.  Therefore, the premise only provides some conditions that might make it likely that the hypothesis is true, but it does not guarantee that the hypothesis is true. There could be other reasons why the Community in Knockglen defends Eve vociferously, even if the girl does not have a valid point. For example, they might be motivated by loyalty or a desire to avoid conflict, rather than a genuine commitment to her argument.	207	
1760489139	1760489140	Premise: ``They have to be crushed, Bobkins!'' So saying, she marched off down the gravel path, making the kind of crunching noise Robert had thought could only be produced by the BBC sound-effects department. As they rounded the edge of the building he could see that behind the house was a vast garden.  Hypothesis: behind the house was a vast garden  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that someone (implied to be a woman, referred to as ""she"") is marching down a gravel path and making a specific sound effect. It also mentions that behind the house is a vast garden, but this information is presented as a statement of fact rather than a cause or consequence of the action described in the premise. The hypothesis is the idea that the speaker will find a vast garden behind the house, but the premise does not provide any logical connection between the action and the outcome.   In other words, the premise sets the scene and introduces the setting, but it does not imply that the outcome (a vast garden) will necessarily occur as a result of the action (the woman marching down the path)."	158	
1760489140	1760489141	Premise: ``Do you mind if I use your phone?'' Ronni could see that Guido's brain was whirring.  Hypothesis: Guido's brain was whirring  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Ronni asked Guido if she could use his phone, but it does not provide any information about Guido's mental state or whether his brain is whirring. The premise only mentions that Ronni could see Guido's brain whirring, but it does not imply that Guido's brain is whirring.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to explicitly state that Guido's brain is whirring, or provide some other information that connects the request for phone use to Guido's mental state. The given premise is more likely describing Ronni's observation, rather than making a statement about Guido's brain.	147	
1760489141	1760489142	Premise: ``Look, lady, give me a break. I just deliver the stuff, I don't interview it for the Sunday papers.'' He waved the paper at her and even at a distance she could see that it said very little.  Hypothesis: the paper said very little  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the speaker waved a paper at the lady and that the paper said ""very little"". However, it does not provide any information about the content of the paper or whether the speaker is claiming that the paper says very little. The speaker's intention or tone is also not specified.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, makes a specific claim about the content of the paper, stating that it says ""very little"". The premise does not provide any information that would support or justify this claim.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the hypothesis is a more specific and assertive claim that is not directly supported by the information provided in the premise."	149	
1760489142	1760489144	Premise: ``You 've heard something like that before. Haven't you, Jimmy?'' Jimmy had been shaken by those sounds more shaken than the others for good reason but Cardiff could see that he was unprepared to show it as he pushed himself away from the reception counter.  Hypothesis: Jimmy was unprepared to show he had been shaken  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise does entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that Cardiff says to Jimmy, ""You've heard something like that before. Haven't you?"" This suggests that Cardiff is implying that Jimmy has a past experience or memory of a similar event or situation.   The hypothesis states that Jimmy was unprepared to show he had been shaken by those sounds. This is a logical consequence of the premise, as the implication is that the sounds are similar to something Jimmy has experienced before, and therefore, he should be emotionally affected or prepared to respond accordingly.  In other words, the premise provides a connection between the sounds and Jimmy's past experience, which is the basis for the hypothesis. The hypothesis is a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the premise, making it an entailment."	157	
1760489144	1760489145	Premise: It was Alan's idea. He made a sour kind of joke out of it, that they must wait until their wedding night. Carolyn agreed because she could see he meant it although she didn't understand why.  Hypothesis: Alan meant it  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Alan made a sour kind of joke out of it, that they must wait until their wedding night, and Carolyn agreed to it. However, the premise does not provide any information that necessarily supports the hypothesis that Alan meant it.  The phrase ""sour kind of joke"" could imply that the joke was not meant to be taken literally or seriously, which would suggest that Alan didn't really mean it. The fact that Carolyn agreed to it despite not understanding why also implies that she may have been misled or taken Alan at face value.  Therefore, the premise only sets the stage for the situation, but it does not provide enough evidence to support the hypothesis that Alan meant it."	152	
1760489145	1760489146	Premise: And why bother to write anyway? What was there to say? Mary had some vague idea that Adam's parents might suspect he was down here and come to see him.  Hypothesis: Adam was down here  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""And why bother to write anyway? What was there to say? Mary had some vague idea that Adam's parents might suspect he was down here and come to see him."" does not entail the hypothesis ""Adam was down here"".  The premise sets up a situation where Mary is writing, possibly to leave a message for Adam or to explain herself, but it does not provide any information about Adam's whereabouts. The mention of Adam's parents is also unclear, as it's possible that they might be looking for Adam, but it's not necessarily a given that they are actually coming to see him.  To entail the hypothesis ""Adam was down here"", the premise would need to include more information, such as ""Mary had seen Adam recently"" or ""Adam had told her that he was down here"". The current premise only sets up a situation where Mary might be writing to communicate with Adam, but it doesn't provide any direct evidence of Adam's presence or actions."	197	
1760489146	1760489147	Premise: ``And you're not having this dress,'' Nora said, bending down to look at the price tag. ``It's two and a half guineas!'' she hissed at Louise who could tell that she was genuinely appalled.  Hypothesis: Nora was genuinely appalled  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that Nora says, ""And you're not having this dress,"" which implies that she is not willing to buy the dress. However, the hypothesis states that she is ""genuinely appalled,"" which means she is shocked or horrified. The premise does not provide any information about Nora's emotional state, so we cannot conclude that she is genuinely appalled. She could be simply disappointed, frustrated, or simply stating the price without actually being appalled. The premise only tells us about her attitude towards the dress, not her emotional response to it."	123	
1760489147	1760489149	Premise: She said good morning to Alice and Alice said hallo. She was thin and rather tall with a very lined gentle face and hair that was white but which Alice could see had once been blonde. She could also have told this was Tina's mother before Mrs Darne went off down the passage that led to the Headmaster's Flat.  Hypothesis: this was Tina's mother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the woman said ""good morning"" to Alice and Alice responded with ""hallo"", and it describes the woman's physical appearance, but it does not provide any information that directly links her to Tina's mother. The passage of time, indicated by Mrs Darne going off down the passage, is also mentioned but it does not establish a causal connection between the woman and Tina's mother.  The hypothesis requires a logical connection between the premise and the conclusion. In this case, the premise provides some characteristics of the woman, but it does not explicitly state that she is Tina's mother. The hypothesis requires additional information to be justified, such as a statement that ""Tina's mother was a woman who said 'good morning' to Alice and responded with 'hallo'""."	171	
1760489149	1760489150	Premise: She might have sat all afternoon, nibbling and stuporous, exhausted but not sleepy. But the glazier finally came down from the upper floor, cheerfully announcing that all was now right and tight and he would be on his way. Maggie could tell that he would have liked to stop for a chat that he felt sorry for her left on her own but she lacked either her grandmother's grace or her mother's energy so she did not offer him tea.  Hypothesis: the glazier would have liked to stop for a chat  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The phrase ""he felt sorry for her"" directly implies that the glazier would have liked to stop for a chat. The phrase ""felt sorry for her"" suggests that the glazier was sympathetic to Maggie's situation and would have enjoyed spending time with her, which is exactly what the hypothesis states. This phrase is strong evidence that the glazier would have liked to stop for a chat, and the hypothesis is supported by the premise."	100	
1760489150	1760489151	Premise: Jim waited. He waited a long time, and when the young doctor finally came out, it was almost dark. Jim could nonetheless tell by his anxious face that something was wrong.  Hypothesis: something was wrong  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Jim waited a long time, and when the young doctor finally came out, it was almost dark, and Jim could tell by his anxious face that something was wrong. However, this premise does not logically imply that the doctor's anxious face is a direct result of the fact that something was wrong. The anxious face could be due to various reasons unrelated to the situation, such as the doctor's personal anxiety, fatigue, or even a personal issue.  The hypothesis ""something was wrong"" is a conclusion that is not necessarily implied by the premise. The premise only sets the scene and establishes a sense of tension and anticipation, but it does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that something was wrong.  To make the premise entail the hypothesis, it would need to include additional information that directly connects the doctor's anxious face to the fact that something was wrong. For example: ""The doctor's anxious face, coupled with the fact that it was almost dark and Jim had waited a long time, suggested that something was wrong."" In this revised premise, the hypothesis is more directly supported by the information provided."	237	
1760489151	1760489153	Premise: ``Yes?'' ``Nathan?'' He could tell it was long-distance the line was so gravelly and hollow but he didn't recognise the voice.  Hypothesis: the call was long-distance  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise and hypothesis are related but not identical.  The premise states that the line was long-distance, which implies that the speaker is unable to recognize the voice on the other end of the line. However, it does not necessarily follow that the call was long-distance in the sense that the speaker is not familiar with the voice.  The hypothesis states that the call was long-distance, which means that the speaker is trying to determine the distance or location of the caller. The premise only provides information about the quality of the voice, not about the caller's location.  To make the premise entail the hypothesis, we would need to add additional information, such as ""He couldn't hear the caller's accent or background noise clearly, which made him think the call was long-distance."" This would imply that the speaker is making an inference about the distance based on the quality of the voice, which would make the premise entail the hypothesis."	187	
1760489153	1760489154	Premise: Chopra stood unsteadily on his feet. The shapechanger bounded around with excitement. Chopra could tell something had happened.  Hypothesis: something had happened  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states: ""Chopra stood unsteadily on his feet. The shapechanger bounded around with excitement. Chopra could tell something had happened.""   This suggests that something unusual or unexpected had occurred, but it does not guarantee that the shapechanger is Chopra. The shapechanger could be someone or something else entirely. The hypothesis ""something had happened"" is too broad and does not provide any information about who or what the shapechanger is or what the event was."	109	
1760489154	1760489155	Premise: It seemed impossible that anyone could endure such pain for so long, but at last the doors of the Renault slammed and there was comparative silence. The engine was started up, revving violently as the car was turned round on the narrow road. John could tell that it was being driven back up the hill towards Putna.  Hypothesis: the car was being driven back up the hill towards Putna  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the doors of the Renault slammed and the engine was started up, and that the car was turned round on the narrow road, and that John could tell that it was being driven back up the hill towards Putna. However, it does not provide any information that necessarily implies the car is being driven back up the hill towards Putna. The phrase ""being driven back up the hill"" could also mean the car is being driven down the hill towards Putna.  The hypothesis requires that the premises guarantee the conclusion. In this case, the premise only sets the stage for the scene, but it doesn't explicitly state the direction of the car's movement. Therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise."	159	
1760489155	1760489156	Premise: Just when you think you 've got it straight, along comes the Fool with his pig's bladder and whops you on the nose. By the way, I'm no idiot. I could tell Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see me at the airport.  Hypothesis: Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see her at the airport  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise describes a situation where the speaker encounters the Fool, who uses a pig's bladder as a projectile, hitting the speaker on the nose. The speaker also mentions that they could tell Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see them at the airport.  However, the premise does not directly state or imply that Gillian and Stuart's reaction is a consequence of the Fool's actions or the speaker's arrival at the airport. It only mentions the speaker's observation of Gillian and Stuart's reaction, which is separate from the Fool's actions.  The hypothesis suggests a causal relationship between the speaker's arrival at the airport and Gillian and Stuart's reaction, whereas the premise only describes the speaker's observation of their reaction. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.	168	
1760489156	1760489158	Premise: He's weird enough to have undressed me without thinking, according to some mad notion of the ``proper'' thing to do. Perhaps he thought I couldn't lie in bed with my clothes on.  Hypothesis: she couldn't lie in bed with her clothes on  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that someone undressed the speaker without their consent, implying a lack of consent and a breach of personal boundaries. However, the hypothesis states that the speaker couldn't lie in bed with their clothes on, which is a separate and unrelated claim.  The premise does not provide any information about the speaker's attire or their ability to lie in bed, and the two statements are not logically connected. The hypothesis is not a logical consequence of the premise, and the premise does not necessarily imply the hypothesis.  To make the premise entail the hypothesis, we would need additional information that links the two statements, such as:  * The person who undressed the speaker was someone who believed that the speaker could only be comfortable or intimate in their underwear. * The person who undressed the speaker was someone who knew that the speaker was uncomfortable with being in bed with their clothes on. * The person who undressed the speaker was someone who believed that it was the ""proper"" thing to do to undress someone while they were in bed.  Without such additional information, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	235	
1760489158	1760489160	Premise: That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort. Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all. But you will perhaps understand that there was a natural tendency on my part in asking what was after all a generous favour from my employer to hint that there was a good professional motive behind my request.  Hypothesis: there was a natural tendency on her part to hint that there was a good professional motive behind her request  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the narrator did not take into account Mr. Farraday's likely mood when bringing in tea, and that it would have been wiser not to mention Miss Kenton due to his bantering tone. This implies that the narrator was aware of Mr. Farraday's mood and was trying to avoid mentioning Miss Kenton because of it.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that there was a natural tendency on Miss Kenton's part to hint that there was a good professional motive behind her request. There is no indication in the premise that Miss Kenton was aware of Mr. Farraday's mood or that she had any intention of hinting at a professional motive.  In fact, the premise suggests that the narrator was the one trying to hint at a professional motive, not Miss Kenton. The hypothesis is actually the opposite of what the premise suggests, and therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.	201	
1760489160	1760489161	Premise: But don't dilly-dally for too long. Once it's published we are all going to look a little risible if we have made no adjustments to what is after all known as being predominantly my own design of gallery. Also I am a bit older than the rest of you but you can perhaps understand that I don't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation.  Hypothesis: he doesn't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the speaker wants to make adjustments to their gallery before it's published, and they don't want to be seen as silly or foolish if they haven't made those adjustments. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the speaker wants a ""proper and public recantation"" (i.e., a public apology or retraction) before they die.  There is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise is concerned with the speaker's concern about the reputation of their gallery, while the hypothesis is about the speaker's desire for a public apology before they die. The two are unrelated, and the hypothesis is not a logical consequence of the premise."	150	
1760489161	1760489163	Premise: I should dearly have liked to know whether they were Europeans or Americans, but I couldn't hear the accents. They appeared to be arguing. I hoped the white men weren't telling him to eliminate all witnesses because I don't believe it would have needed much persuasion.  Hypothesis: eliminating all witnesses would have needed much persuasion  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the speaker heard the men arguing and thought they might be white men, but they couldn't tell for sure because they couldn't hear their accents. It also mentions that the speaker hopes the men aren't telling someone to eliminate all witnesses, but this is not a direct consequence of the men being white or the argument they are having.  The hypothesis is a conditional statement that assumes eliminating all witnesses would have needed much persuasion, but the premise does not provide any information that would necessarily lead to this conclusion. The speaker's concern about the men's intentions is based on their appearance (being white) and the context of the argument, but it is not a direct inference from these facts.  In other words, the premise sets the scene and establishes some background information, but it does not provide a logical connection between the facts and the hypothesis. The hypothesis is a separate statement that requires additional information or inference to be supported by the premise.	202	
1760489163	1760489164	Premise: But the damage was done as far as my faith was concerned, which is probably why I went mad. So anyway, that Christmas Eve night confirmed my worst fears, it was like a kind of ``royal flush'' for the infant Jimbo. All three kings - Pa Santa and the King of Kings - all down the pan together... And to be honest I don't believe any of them stands a chance of ever making a comeback with me.  Hypothesis: any of the three kings stands a chance of ever making a comeback with him  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the speaker's faith was damaged, which led to them going mad, and that a series of unfortunate events (the ""royal flush"" of Pa Santa and the King of Kings) confirmed their worst fears. However, it does not imply that any of the three kings (Pa Santa and the King of Kings) stands a chance of making a comeback.  In fact, the premise suggests the opposite: the speaker explicitly states that they don't believe any of the three kings can make a comeback, which is the hypothesis. The tone and language used in the passage also implies a sense of finality and irreversibility, with the speaker seeming to welcome the idea of the kings being ""down the pan"" (a phrase often used to describe something being utterly defeated or ruined)."	172	
1760489164	1760489165	Premise: He had seen something I should have, which was a car turning in from Soho Square and coming up behind me. My right foot hovered over the accelerator pedal and I balanced Armstrong on the clutch. I wasn't as convinced as Malpass that Nevil was out of harm's way.  Hypothesis: Nevil was out of harm's way  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the narrator had seen a car turning in from Soho Square and coming up behind them, and that they were balancing Armstrong on the clutch. However, it does not provide any information that would support the hypothesis that Nevil is out of harm's way.  In fact, the phrase ""I wasn't as convinced as Malpass that Nevil was out of harm's way"" suggests that there is some uncertainty or doubt about Nevil's safety, which contradicts the hypothesis. The hypothesis would require evidence that Nevil is actually out of harm's way, but the premise does not provide any such evidence."	138	
1760489165	1760489167	Premise: Jed wondered. He 'd scarcely set eyes on him since the night they 'd had dinner together at the house in Westwood. Nobody had mentioned him either and Jed didn't feel he should ask.  Hypothesis: Jed should ask  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Jed hasn't seen the person since a dinner party at a house in Westwood, and nobody has mentioned him since then. This information suggests that Jed is hesitant to ask about the person, implying that he may be worried about the outcome or unsure of how the person will react.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Jed ""should ask"". This is an evaluative statement that makes a recommendation or judgment about what Jed should do. The premise does not provide any information that would justify or support this conclusion, and it does not imply that Jed has a compelling reason to ask the person.  In other words, the premise provides a situation, but it does not provide a basis for making a recommendation or judgment about what Jed should do. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	177	
1760489167	1760489168	Premise: Yet what good came from knowing that a woman had killed herself? The children who had suffered a trauma would survive the experience, scarred by it and a little flawed by it. They would never forget that for a week they had imagined the act of murder had been committed.  Hypothesis: for a week the children had imagined the act of murder had been committed  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the children would ""never forget that for a week they had imagined the act of murder had been committed."" This implies that the children would remember the experience of imagining the act of murder for a week, but it does not necessarily mean that they would remember the details or specifics of the act itself.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the children imagined the act of murder had been committed. This is a stronger claim that requires more information than what is provided in the premise. The premise only mentions that the children imagined the act of murder, but it does not confirm that they actually believed the act had been committed.  In other words, the premise only tells us about the children's imagination, but not about their actual beliefs or thoughts about the act. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	180	
1760489168	1760489169	Premise: Nora calculated that there must be lots of single men up there so she decided it was ideal for the ``manhunt'', as we called it, even though the train fare was a serious consideration. I remember we went up to Euston together one Saturday morning, very excited, to buy the ticket in advance. It was a secret - if my parents had known she was going away alone they would have soon put the kybosh on it.  Hypothesis: Nora was going away alone  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that Nora and someone else went to buy a ticket together, but it does not necessarily mean that Nora is going away alone. The hypothesis states that Nora was going away alone, but the premise only mentions that she went with someone else to buy the ticket, not that she is going away alone.	74	
1760489169	1760489169	Premise: His mother driving the car, so happy, young-looking and fashionably dressed and his father, a big, confident man in a smart suit, smiling and turning round to say something to Simon in the back seat. Marie thought of her own mother with her frumpy clothes and ageing, lined face. No one would have guessed that she was only forty-two.  Hypothesis: Marie's mother was only forty-two  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise describes the appearance of Marie's parents in a scene, but it does not provide any information about Marie's mother's age. The hypothesis states that Marie's mother is only forty-two, but the premise does not provide any evidence to support this claim. The description of Marie's mother as ""frumpy"" and having an ""ageing, lined face"" actually suggests that she may be older than forty-two, not younger. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	109	
1760489169	1760489172	Premise: ``I hope you are settling down and the cat is well.'' This was a lie. She did not hope the cat was well.  Hypothesis: the cat was well  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""I hope you are settling down and the cat is well"" does not entail the hypothesis ""the cat is well"".  In logic, an entailment is a relationship where the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. In this case, the premise is a complex statement that contains two clauses: ""I hope you are settling down"" and ""the cat is well"". However, the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis.  There are several reasons why:  1. The speaker's statement about hoping for the cat to be well is an expression of their desire, but it does not necessarily mean that the cat is actually well. The speaker might be expressing goodwill or sympathy, without actually knowing the cat's condition. 2. The phrase ""I hope you are settling down"" is a wish or a desire for the person, not a statement about the cat. It's possible that the speaker is hoping for the person's well-being, not the cat's. 3. The phrase ""the cat is well"" is a separate statement that is not directly related to the person's statement. It could be that the cat is actually ill or injured, and the speaker is simply not aware of it.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, and the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis."	280	
1760489172	1760489173	Premise: Jane ate without pausing. Hunger was an unknown experience. She had never imagined it could actually hurt.  Hypothesis: hunger could actually hurt  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Jane ate without pausing and that she had never imagined hunger could hurt. However, it does not provide any information that suggests hunger itself can hurt. The premise only describes Jane's experience of eating without pausing, and her lack of familiarity with hunger. The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that hunger can actually hurt.  The premise only establishes a correlation between Jane's eating behavior and her lack of experience with hunger, but it does not provide any direct evidence that hunger itself is capable of causing pain. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.	129	
1760489173	1760489174	Premise: Miss Martindale had had a school, but her rigid ideas and stern manner had frightened the children, and their parents had taken them away. And gradually the school declined, until she had to give it up and retire to end her days in the white cottage with the inevitable cat as her only companion. Breeze had never imagined that digging was such hard work.  Hypothesis: digging was such hard work  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise states that Miss Martindale had to give up her school and retire, and that she would spend her days in a white cottage with a cat as her only companion. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a statement about the difficulty of digging. The two are unrelated, and there is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis.  The premise only mentions digging as an activity that Breeze is doing, but it does not provide any information about the difficulty of that activity. The difficulty of digging is not a conclusion that can be inferred from the premise.	127	
1760489174	1760489175	Premise: ``You don't need to worry. We're quite adequately chaperoned. Rosa is a woman of strict moral principles.'' If she knows I'm in here she's probably hovering outside the door right now.  Hypothesis: he's in here  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that ""Rosa is a woman of strict moral principles"" and ""If she knows you're in here, she's probably hovering outside the door right now."" This implies a conditional relationship between Rosa knowing the person is in the room and her likely behavior. However, the premise does not provide any information about whether Rosa actually knows that the person is in the room.   The hypothesis states that the person is in the room. The premise does not provide any direct evidence to support this hypothesis, as it only talks about Rosa's behavior if she knows the person is in the room, not about whether she actually knows it."	139	
1760489175	1760489177	Premise: I said you were mad to come over at this time. It's a world event. Don't you know that Venice is packed with visitors?  Hypothesis: Venice is packed with visitors  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that ""You said you were mad to come over at this time"" and ""It's a world event. Don't you know that Venice is packed with visitors?"" The first part of the premise suggests that the speaker is upset because you were planning to visit them at a particular time, but the second part is a statement about Venice being packed with visitors.  The hypothesis is about Venice being packed with visitors, but the premise only mentions Venice in relation to the speaker's plan to visit them, not in relation to the speaker's anger or frustration. The two statements are separate and unrelated, and there is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis.  For example, if the premise had said ""You said you were mad because I suggested we visit Venice at this time, and it's a world event that's causing the crowds,"" then the premise would entail the hypothesis. In this revised premise, the two statements are connected, and the speaker's anger is directly related to the fact that Venice is crowded due to the world event."	223	
1760489177	1760489178	Premise: And what she had said, and went on saying quietly, calmly, efficiently, was that she loved Maggie. She paid attention. At eight Maggie had not known that her grandmother was famous but she had seen that people had something in their manner when they looked at Rachel.  Hypothesis: Maggie's grandmother was famous  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise states that the speaker has noticed a change in people's behavior when they look at Rachel, and that Rachel says she loves Maggie. However, it does not explicitly state that Rachel is famous. The premise only mentions that Maggie has not known that her grandmother is famous, which implies that Rachel may be a public figure, but it's not a direct statement that Rachel is famous.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis that Rachel is famous. The hypothesis requires a direct statement that Rachel is famous, which is not present in the premise.  A more accurate analysis would be:  Premise: Maggie's grandmother has a different manner when people look at her. Hypothesis: Rachel is famous.  In this case, the premise supports the hypothesis, but the hypothesis is not explicitly stated.	164	
1760489178	1760489179	Premise: They 'd seen Miss Lavant on the promenade and about the town, always walking slowly, sometimes with a neat wicker basket. Kate had often thought she was beautiful. She hadn't known she was in love with Dr Greenslade who had a wife already and three children.  Hypothesis: Miss Lavant was in love with Dr Greenslade  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Kate has often thought Miss Lavant was beautiful and that she is walking slowly around town with a wicker basket, but it does not provide any information about Miss Lavant's feelings or intentions towards Dr. Greenslade. It simply presents a neutral observation about Miss Lavant's appearance and behavior.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, implies that Miss Lavant is in love with Dr. Greenslade, which is not supported by the premise. The premise does not mention Dr. Greenslade at all, let alone Miss Lavant's feelings towards him. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.	141	
1760489179	1760489180	Premise: Did he intend everyone in the castle to know he did not want the wife he had married in such a hurry? Did he intend to ignore her completely? Then Isabel saw Ellen's stunned face and realised that her maid at least did not know she had spent the night alone.  Hypothesis: Isabel had spent the night alone  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Isabel saw Ellen's stunned face, implying that Ellen did know about Isabel's actions (i.e., spending the night alone). However, this does not necessarily mean that Isabel intended to share her secret with Ellen. The fact that Ellen is stunned suggests that she was surprised or shocked, not that she knew about Isabel's actions beforehand.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to state that Isabel explicitly intended to keep her secret hidden from everyone, including Ellen. As it stands, the premise only provides indirect evidence that Isabel did not intend to share her secret with Ellen, but it does not provide any direct evidence that she intended to ignore her wife or keep her secret hidden from everyone.	154	
1760489180	1760489181	Premise: Most of them young, about his age, stood and talked and drank and laughed. The two girls he had noticed earlier were standing talking to some other girls. Graham hoped they all realised that just because he was standing talking to Slater that didn't mean he was gay too.  Hypothesis: Graham was gay too  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that Graham was noticed by two girls, but it does not provide any information about Graham's sexual orientation or his relationship with the girls who noticed him. The fact that he is standing and talking to Slater, another person, does not necessarily imply that Graham is gay. The presence of other girls talking to the girls who noticed Graham could also suggest that Graham is just a common acquaintance or friend of someone they know, rather than a romantic partner. Therefore, the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that Graham is gay.	121	
1760489181	1760489182	Premise: He said that maybe I wasn't ready to join the Party just yet. Terry's passion for equality appealed to my purer mind, and his hatred of existing authority appealed to my resentments. But although I hated inequality it didn't mean I wanted to be treated like everyone else.  Hypothesis: he wanted to be treated like everyone else  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Terry's passion for equality appealed to the speaker's purer mind and his hatred of existing authority appealed to the speaker's resentments. This suggests that the speaker is drawn to Terry's values and ideas, but it does not imply that Terry wants to be treated like everyone else. The hypothesis states that Terry wants to be treated like everyone else, which is a specific and distinct claim that is not supported by the information provided in the premise.  The premise only mentions Terry's values and the speaker's emotional response to them, but it does not provide any information about Terry's personal desires or preferences, let alone his desire to be treated like everyone else. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the hypothesis follows from the premise.	161	
1760489182	1760489184	Premise: ``Oh, my poor Folly... We 've been together for five years, Lexy and I - she practically holds that company together. Of course I gave her an ``A''. But that doesn't mean I'm having an affair with her.  Hypothesis: he is having an affair with Lexy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the speaker has given Lexy an ""A"" and that she ""practically holds the company together."" However, this information alone does not necessarily imply that the speaker is having an affair with Lexy.  The speaker's tone and language suggest that they are trying to reassure someone (perhaps a friend or family member) that they are not having an affair with Lexy, despite the close relationship they have with her. The use of the phrase ""Oh, my poor Folly"" and the word ""A"" (presumably an academic or professional achievement) imply that the speaker is trying to downplay any potential suspicions about their relationship with Lexy.  The hypothesis assumes that the speaker is having an affair with Lexy, but the premise does not provide any direct evidence to support this claim. The speaker's words can be interpreted as an attempt to reassure someone of their innocence, rather than an admission of infidelity."	202	
1760489184	1760489185	Premise: Nevertheless, her heart sank at the thought of spending an evening with him in his present state of mind, and she was tempted to invent a sore throat in order to get out of it. But he had been very helpful over the Puddephat business, she admitted to herself, and his moods were unpredictable - he might be on top of the world by the time he arrived at the cinema. ``I'm still keen if you are '' she said brightly pretending she had not noticed anything was amiss.  Hypothesis: something was amiss  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The hypothesis is ""something was amiss"". This is explicitly stated in the premise: ""her heart sank at the thought of spending an evening with him in his present state of mind"". The use of the phrase ""present state of mind"" implies that there is a concern or uncertainty about his mental state, suggesting that something is not quite right. Additionally, the fact that she is tempted to invent a sore throat to get out of the evening also implies that she is aware of a potential problem with his mental state.  Furthermore, the phrase ""his moods were unpredictable"" also suggests that there is a concern about his emotional state, which further supports the hypothesis.  Overall, the language and tone used in the premise create a sense of unease and uncertainty, which is consistent with the hypothesis that ""something was amiss""."	176	
1760489185	1760489187	Premise: What must it be like to be imprisoned here, day after day, month after month? I wonder, does he keep them chained and manacled, thought Fenella, or does he use sorcery? And so utterly immersed was she in this strange blue and green land that was not feeling strange any more that she did not even notice that she was weighing sorcery against steel chains and seriously considering the likely outcome.  Hypothesis: Fenella was weighing sorcery against steel chains  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise does not entail the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states that Fenella is imagining a scenario where she is thinking about whether the prisoner is being held by sorcery or steel chains, but it does not assert that she is actually weighing sorcery against steel chains. The phrase ""weighing sorcery against steel chains"" is a metaphorical expression that suggests a mental comparison between the two options, rather than a literal weighing of their physical properties.  In other words, the premise describes Fenella's thought process, but it does not imply that she is physically holding sorcery and steel chains in her hands or attempting to compare their weights. The phrase ""seriously considering the likely outcome"" also suggests that Fenella is thinking about the implications of the two possibilities, rather than physically comparing their weights.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, and it is possible to interpret the premise as simply describing Fenella's imagination and thought process, without assuming that she is actually engaging in a physical weighing."	207	
1760489187	1760489189	Premise: Strasbourg, Vienna, Bucharest, Istanbul, not stopping, not looking back. I saw her tossing newly gauffred curls as the open roadster headed east, away from Ollie... Temporarily I managed to re-erect my jocular facade, but inside I was panicking. He could take her away I thought he could just do that he has such power to hurt me this little furry creature who hasn't even noticed that I 've given up the weed.  Hypothesis: he has given up the weed  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise does entail the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states: ""I saw her tossing newly gauffred curls as the open roadster headed east, away from Ollie...""  The hypothesis states: ""he has given up the weed""  The key word here is ""gauffred"", which is an archaic or poetic term for ""guy"" or ""guyfellow"". However, in this context, it's likely being used as a colloquialism or a term of endearment for ""he"".  The phrase ""away from Ollie"" suggests that the speaker is leaving someone behind, and the use of ""he"" in this context implies that the person being left behind is the one who has given up the weed.  The speaker's inner monologue ""Temporarily I managed to re-erect my jocular facade, but inside I was panicking"" suggests that the speaker is worried about the person who has given up the weed, implying that the speaker is invested in the outcome of this person's decision.  Overall, the premise sets up a narrative where the speaker is watching someone leave, and the person being left behind is someone who has given up the weed, which is the hypothesis."	256	
1760489189	1760489190	Premise: It - the tractor, the boys and the bulbs in the earth - knew she had chosen for them and was coming back to them. Of course there was still love, there was healthy, growing love and its name was called Work. She had fallen in love with it so slowly and gently and sweetly that she had never noticed it had happened.  Hypothesis: falling in love had happened  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that the tractor, the boys, and the bulbs in the earth knew that she had chosen for them and was coming back to them, and that love was involved. However, it does not explicitly state that she had fallen in love. The term ""love"" is mentioned as a name of the concept, ""healthy, growing love and its name was called Work"", but it is not clear whether the subject of the sentence is the person or something else.  The hypothesis suggests that the subject had fallen in love, but the premise only mentions the concept of love, not the subject. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	142	
1760489190	1760489191	Premise: After the twelfth dot, two thirds of the way down the page, the transcript of this long session tails away into blank paper. I suppose what's happened is this. He has gone on staring out of the window thinking and she has gone on staring at him waiting with such absorption that neither of them noticed the tape had run out.  Hypothesis: the tape had run out  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that after the twelfth dot, two thirds of the way down the page, the transcript tails away into blank paper. However, it does not explicitly state that the tape had run out. The reason for the blank paper could be anything else, such as a printer jam or a lack of material.   The hypothesis requires that the blank paper be caused by the tape running out, but the premise only provides a description of the situation without making any causal connections. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.	117	
1760489191	1760489192	Premise: ``His name is Matthew Blake,'' Mandy informed Charity as they descended the steps from their cabin on to the paved pathway that led to the lodge. Thankfully she hadn't even noticed that Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt and was now wearing red shorts with her white silk blouse.  Hypothesis: Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise states that Mandy informed Charity about her name, but it does not provide any information about Charity's clothing. The hypothesis states that Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt, but this is not mentioned in the premise. The premise only mentions Mandy's statement and the change in scenery from the cabin to the lodge.   To entail the hypothesis, there would need to be a direct connection between the premise and the hypothesis, such as: ""As Mandy informed Charity about her name, she couldn't help but notice that Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt."" This would make the premise entail the hypothesis."	138	
1760489192	1760489194	Premise: ``These ` ere smugglers is a dangerous bunch from wot I 've ` eard!'' ``If only we could devise a safe way of laying our hands on all that money,'' murmured Pugwash, whose greed was as proverbial as his cowardice. And the pirates were so busy discussing the problem and what they would do with the reward if they won it that they didn't notice that they were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage.  Hypothesis: the pirates were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Pugwash and the pirates are discussing the problem of obtaining the money, but it does not provide any information about who is observing them from the window above. The hypothesis states that the pirates are being observed by the new Mayor and his entourage.  The premise only mentions that the Mayor and his entourage are present in the scene, but it does not imply that they are observing the pirates. In fact, the premise suggests that the Mayor and his entourage are not paying attention to the pirates, as Pugwash and the pirates are too caught up in their discussion.  Therefore, there is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis, and the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.	158	
1760489194	1760489195	Premise: Ockleton, Morpurgo, Cornelius, Dysart and half a dozen others too drunk to mention. But there was so much coming and going that any one of us could have slipped out, pushed Everett through the window and slipped back again without being noticed. Damn it all we didn't even notice Everett was missing until a porter tripped over him in the quad so anything's theoretically possible.  Hypothesis: Everett was missing  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise and hypothesis are related but not equivalent.  The premise is a statement that describes a chaotic scene at a party, mentioning several people who were drunk and mentions Everett's absence. It sets the stage for a possible scenario where something unexpected might have happened to Everett.  The hypothesis, ""Everett was missing,"" is a specific statement that suggests a particular outcome. The premise does not explicitly state that Everett was missing, but rather sets the stage for it to be possible. The phrase ""we didn't even notice Everett was missing"" implies that Everett's absence was not immediately apparent, but it does not confirm that he was actually missing.  In other words, the premise provides context and possibilities, while the hypothesis is a more specific claim about the situation. The premise does not entail the hypothesis; it merely provides a scenario in which the hypothesis could be true."	175	
1760489195	1760489196	Premise: His hair was white, as my daughters reported when they went to view the body before it was given to the Odonata. Now he is known as The Man Who Changed the World, and there are statues to him everywhere. No one remembers he had a younger brother.  Hypothesis: The Man Who Changed the World had a younger brother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise states that ""His hair was white, as my daughters reported when they went to view the body before it was given to the Odonata"" and ""Now he is known as The Man Who Changed the World, and there are statues to him everywhere."" This implies that the man in question is deceased and has been given a grandiose title, but it does not provide any information about a younger brother.  The hypothesis ""The Man Who Changed the World had a younger brother"" is an additional piece of information that is not mentioned in the premise. Therefore, the premise does not entail this hypothesis, as it does not provide any evidence or logical connection to support it."	146	
1760489196	1760489198	Premise: Oh, I did, I did! I was lucky. I would have liked brothers and sisters but I don't remember that I was ever lonely.  Hypothesis: she was ever lonely  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states: ""Oh, I did, I did! I was lucky. I would have liked brothers and sisters but I don't remember that I was ever lonely.""  The premise describes the speaker's past experiences, their feelings of luck, and their desire for siblings. However, it does not provide any information that would necessarily lead to the conclusion that the speaker was ever lonely. In fact, the speaker explicitly states ""I don't remember that I was ever lonely"", which directly contradicts the hypothesis.  The speaker's statement implies that they do not recall feeling lonely, which suggests that they may not have been lonely in the past. The hypothesis ""she was ever lonely"" seems to refer to someone else (referred to as ""she"" in the statement), but there is no indication that the speaker is referring to themselves. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	191	
1760489198	1760489199	Premise: Her priggishness. I admire it. I know she does wrong things she tries to organize other people's lives she can't see Mr Knightley is a man in a million.  Hypothesis: Mr Knightley is a man in a million  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""Her priggishness. I admire it. I know she does wrong things she tries to organize other people's lives"" does not entail the hypothesis ""Mr Knightley is a man in a million.""  Entailment is a logical relationship between a premise and a hypothesis where the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. In this case, there is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis.  The premise describes a character's admiration for someone's priggish behavior, specifically their tendency to try to organize other people's lives. This does not provide any information about Mr. Knightley's character or qualities. The hypothesis, ""Mr Knightley is a man in a million,"" is a subjective evaluation of Mr. Knightley's character, implying that he is exceptional or remarkable in some way.  The premise only mentions Mr. Knightley in the context of the character Emma Woodhouse, suggesting that he is someone she knows or has an opinion about, but it does not provide any information that would logically connect him to the hypothesis. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	227	
1760489199	1760489201	Premise: Only she herself knew the evil thoughts she had and how effortlessly they could be translated into action. ``I 'll make a cup of tea.'' No she would not tell Peter that the person he loved most in the world was dead.  Hypothesis: the person Peter loved most in the world was dead  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise and hypothesis are related but not equivalent.  The premise states that the person she herself knew the evil thoughts she had and how effortlessly they could be translated into action. This suggests that she has knowledge of her own thoughts and intentions, but it doesn't necessarily imply that her thoughts are evil.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the person Peter loved most in the world was dead. This is a specific claim about Peter's relationship status.  The premise only discusses the narrator's thoughts and feelings, while the hypothesis makes a claim about Peter's relationship status. The premise doesn't provide any information about Peter's relationship or his loved ones, so it doesn't entail the hypothesis.  To make the premise entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to be revised to include information that links the narrator's thoughts to Peter's relationship status. For example:  ""The person she herself knew that the person Peter loved most in the world was dead.""  This revised premise would imply that the narrator's knowledge of her own thoughts and intentions is connected to the fact that Peter's loved one is dead, which would entail the hypothesis."	231	
1760489201	1760489202	Premise: ``It's not your day, is it, dear?'' ``No, but they 've got to be done, and Shirley's making the tea.'' Ianthe had not told her mother that she sometimes had to dust the books in the library.  Hypothesis: Ianthe sometimes had to dust the books in the library  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Ianthe had not told her mother that she sometimes had to dust the books in the library, but it does not provide any information about Ianthe's actual duties or responsibilities in the library. It only mentions that her mother is making tea, which is unrelated to the hypothesis.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to provide more information about Ianthe's role or responsibilities in the library, such as ""Ianthe is a librarian"" or ""Ianthe is responsible for maintaining the library"". Without this additional information, the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis."	133	
1760489202	1760489203	Premise: He pulled occasionally, his arms tiring. Conker slowed a little, but the branches were coming too fast, he had to lean right forward and couldn't use his hands. He remembered the gate at the end of the track had time to hope it was open because he didn't think Conker could jump it.  Hypothesis: Conker could jump the gate  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that Conker's arms are tiring, which makes it difficult for him to continue and lean forward. It also mentions that the branches are coming too fast, making it hard for him to use his hands. However, it does not provide any information that suggests Conker has the ability to jump.  The premise only mentions that Conker has to lean right forward, which could be due to his tiring arms or the fast-approaching branches, but it does not imply that he has the physical ability to jump. The hypothesis that Conker can jump the gate is not supported by the premise.	136	
1760489203	1760489204	Premise: But he ended up eating it himself. I was reluctant to kiss my mother, afraid that somehow her weakness and unhappiness would infect me. Naturally I didn't think for a minute that my life and spirit could stimulate her.  Hypothesis: her life and spirit could stimulate her mother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that the speaker was reluctant to kiss their mother because they were afraid that her weakness and unhappiness would infect them. This implies that the speaker believes that their mother's emotional state (weakness and unhappiness) could negatively impact them.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the speaker's life and spirit could stimulate their mother. This is the opposite of what the premise states, as the premise focuses on the negative potential of the mother's emotional state, while the hypothesis implies a positive effect.  There is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis, so the premise does not entail the hypothesis.	139	
1760489204	1760489206	Premise: ``Ely,'' I said (that was her name and the first time I 'd ever used it), ``I want to be free.'' She looked stunned. I don't think she 'd considered this.  Hypothesis: Ely had considered him wanting to be free  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise states that Ely said ""I want to be free,"" and the hypothesis states that Ely had considered him wanting to be free.  The problem is that the premise does not provide any information about Ely's thoughts or intentions. It only mentions what Ely said, which is a statement of desire. The hypothesis, however, implies that Ely had a prior consideration of the speaker's desire for freedom. There is no logical connection between Ely's statement and her having considered the speaker's desire for freedom.  In other words, the premise does not provide sufficient information to support the conclusion that Ely had considered the speaker's desire for freedom. Therefore, we cannot infer the hypothesis from the premise."	179	
1760489206	1760489207	Premise: I'm sorry, I 've put you in an invidious position. If you're being run by Morton, he 'll want to hear all this. It won't do any harm but I 'd rather not give him food for thought because I consider him an idiot and I don't think he's capable of interpreting it correctly.  Hypothesis: Morton is capable of interpreting this food for thought correctly  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that Morton is capable of interpreting the food for thought correctly, which directly contradicts the hypothesis that Morton is not capable of interpreting it correctly. If Morton is indeed capable of interpreting the food for thought correctly, then the hypothesis is false.   In a logically sound argument, the premise and hypothesis should not contradict each other. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.	87	
1760489207	1760489208	Premise: The big Norwegian shook his head, frowning. ``Jeg fonstAr ikke.'' I don't think he found Ward's accent at all easy and anyway like many foreigners he found it easier to speak English than to understand it.  Hypothesis: the big Norwegian found Ward's accent at all easy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the big Norwegian ""fonstAr ikke"" (which is Norwegian for ""I don't think""), and that he found Ward's accent at all easy. However, the hypothesis states that the big Norwegian found Ward's accent not easy at all.  The two statements are not logically connected, and the fact that the big Norwegian found Ward's accent hard to understand does not necessarily mean he found it ""at all easy"". The phrase ""at all easy"" is a more extreme way of saying ""not easy"", and the premise only says that he found it hard to understand, not that he found it impossible or extremely difficult.  In other words, the premise only tells us that the big Norwegian found Ward's accent hard to understand, but it does not rule out the possibility that he found it only slightly difficult or that he was able to understand it with some effort. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."	198	
1760489208	1760489210	Premise: You really don't know anything about me, do you, despite all that wallowing in my mind? As it happens I don't think I'm the right person to lead humanity into the future no.  Hypothesis: she is the right person to lead humanity into the future  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""You really don't know anything about me, do you, despite all that wallowing in my mind?"" suggests that the speaker feels a sense of mystery or obscurity, implying that their thoughts, feelings, and intentions are unknown or unclear.  The hypothesis ""She is the right person to lead humanity into the future"" is a bold statement that implies a level of certainty and confidence in the speaker's ability to lead.  However, there is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise is a introspective statement about the speaker's own thoughts and feelings, while the hypothesis is a statement about the speaker's qualifications or abilities to lead humanity.  Therefore, I would argue that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise does not provide any information that would logically lead us to conclude that the speaker is the right person to lead humanity into the future. The premise only expresses the speaker's self-doubt and uncertainty about themselves, while the hypothesis makes a sweeping claim about their leadership abilities.  In other words, the premise is more about the speaker's inner state, while the hypothesis is a claim about their external abilities. The two statements are unrelated, and we cannot logically infer the hypothesis from the premise."	251	
1760489210	1760489211	Premise: It's where the bands practise. I can't remember what band Petra's in, but I seen them practise once. They were OK but I didn't think they was brilliant.  Hypothesis: Petra's band was brilliant  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the bands practice at the same location, but it does not provide any information about the quality of the bands or the practice session itself. The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that Petra's band was brilliant, which is a subjective evaluation.  The premise only provides neutral information about the location, while the hypothesis is a value judgment. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the two statements are not logically connected.	103	
1760489211	1760489212	Premise: She swallowed hard, unsure if she had the nerve to go ahead. The memory of the pain in Tara's eyes last night decided her. Did he really expect her to believe that Tara was only the housekeeper?  Hypothesis: Tara was only the housekeeper  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the memory of the pain in Tara's eyes last night decided her, implying that Tara had experienced some kind of traumatic or painful event, and this experience had a profound effect on her decision. This suggests that Tara may not be the housekeeper, as the premise implies that she is capable of experiencing pain and making decisions based on that experience.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Tara was only the housekeeper, which is a specific claim about Tara's identity. The premise does not provide any information that would necessarily lead to this conclusion. In fact, the premise seems to suggest the opposite, that Tara may be someone who has experienced pain and is making a decision based on that experience.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, and the hypothesis is not necessarily true based on the information provided.	181	
1760489212	1760489214	Premise: If there are spirits at work at the time, they come only from yourself, not from the fume of the incense. Why should spirits aid living beings? What arrogance is it that drives people to believe they can have power over them?  Hypothesis: people can have power over spirits  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""If there are spirits at work at the time, they come only from yourself, not from the fume of the incense"" does not entail the hypothesis ""people can have power over spirits.""  To entail means that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must necessarily follow. However, in this case, the premise only states that the spirits are a product of the individual's own energy or consciousness, but it does not imply that the individual has control or power over these spirits.  The premise does not provide any information about the nature of the spirits, their behavior, or the relationship between the individual and the spirits. It only establishes that the spirits are an internal product, not an external entity that can be manipulated or controlled.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis that people can have power over spirits. The hypothesis requires additional information to be supported by the premise."	182	
1760489214	1760489215	Premise: Why should this topic matter? You talked about everything else as you usually do. Why should I feel Maelmuire is important?  Hypothesis: Maelmuire is important  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.  The premise is: ""Why should this topic matter? You talked about everything else as you usually do. Why should I feel Maelmuire is important?""  The hypothesis is: ""Maelmuire is important.""  The premise suggests that Maelmuire is being discussed, which implies that it is relevant or noteworthy. However, it does not provide any direct evidence or logical connection that justifies why Maelmuire is specifically important. The phrase ""Why should I feel"" also implies a subjective judgment, which is not necessarily linked to the importance of Maelmuire.  Therefore, I would argue that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise provides some information about Maelmuire, but it does not provide sufficient justification or logical connection to conclude that Maelmuire is indeed important."	190	
1760489215	1760489217	Premise: It is all very well, in these changing times, to adapt one's work to take in duties not traditionally within one's realm. But bantering is of another dimension altogether. For one thing how would one know for sure that at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected?  Hypothesis: at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that it is acceptable to adapt one's work to take on duties not traditionally within one's realm, but this does not necessarily imply that bantering is a common or expected form of communication in these situations. The premise is focused on work and adapting to new roles, while the hypothesis is about bantering as a form of communication.  The premise is more about flexibility and adaptability in a professional setting, whereas the hypothesis is about a specific type of social interaction (bantering). The two concepts are not directly related, and the premise does not provide any information about the nature of communication or social interactions.  In other words, just because someone is adapting to a new role or task, it doesn't mean they are automatically expected to engage in bantering or that it's a common practice in their work. The premise does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis.	189	
1760489217	1760489218	Premise: But the horror of losing was as much to do with money as with pride. Biddy had never let them down, come without fail all through the bad weather, and now was giving Nails an intensive course on her own horse which - in terms of money - was worth another couple of hundred pounds. Yet surely she knew they had no way of paying should she demand it?  Hypothesis: they had no way of paying  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that Biddy had never let them down and was giving Nails an intensive course on her own horse, which is worth £200. This implies that she is willing to invest time and money into Nails' training. However, it does not necessarily mean that they cannot afford to pay her. The premise only mentions that the course is worth £200, not that they are unable to pay.  The hypothesis states that they had no way of paying, which is a negative claim that is not supported by the premise. The premise only mentions the value of the course, not the ability to pay. Therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.	147	
1760489218	1760489220	Premise: I ducked so fast I wasn't sure whether he 'd seen me or not, but it gave me a prickly feeling just to imagine it, so I scuttled for the door and legged it up the spiral stairway three steps at a time, just in case. As I ran, I remember thinking stupid thoughts like. How did he know I was up here looking down?  Hypothesis: he was up there looking down  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that the speaker ducks and then scuttles up the stairs, implying that they are trying to avoid someone. However, it does not provide any information that would necessarily support the hypothesis that the person they are trying to avoid is indeed up the stairs.   The speaker's actions (ducking and scuttling up the stairs) suggest that they are trying to avoid the person, but this could be due to various reasons, such as fear, shyness, or simply not wanting to interact with the person. The hypothesis assumes that the person is up the stairs, but the premise does not provide any direct evidence to support this claim.  For example, the person could be on the ground floor, the person could be on the stairs but not visible to the speaker, or the person could be somewhere else entirely. The premise does not provide enough information to rule out other possibilities or to confirm the hypothesis.	197	
1760489220	1760489221	Premise: At the heart of the universe there is cruelty. We are predators and are preyed upon, every living thing. Did you know that wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds piercing the weak spot in their armour?  Hypothesis: wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that ""At the heart of the universe there is cruelty"" and that ""We are predators and are preyed upon, every living thing."" This sets a general tone of a world where predation and vulnerability are inherent aspects of life.  However, the hypothesis ""Wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds"" is a specific and detailed claim about the behavior of wasps and ladybirds. The premise does not provide any information about the specific behavior of wasps, let alone their relationship with ladybirds.  To make the premise entail the hypothesis, there would need to be additional information that links the general statement about cruelty and predation to the specific behavior of wasps and ladybirds, such as: ""In the natural world, wasps are known to exhibit a particularly cruel behavior of laying eggs in the vulnerable spots of ladybirds."" This would make the hypothesis a more specific and logical consequence of the premise."	198	
1760489221	1760489223	Premise: ``I wanted to tell you. But the Bookman asked me to keep our meeting a secret.'' How did you know I 'd met him?  Hypothesis: he had met the Bookman  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""I wanted to tell you. But the Bookman asked me to keep our meeting a secret"" does not entail the hypothesis ""he had met the Bookman"".  Entailment occurs when one statement necessarily follows logically from another statement. In this case, the premise does not imply that the speaker had met the Bookman. The speaker could have met the Bookman before, after, or even never met him at all.  The premise only mentions that the Bookman asked the speaker to keep the meeting a secret, which could be the case even if the speaker had never met the Bookman before. The speaker's motivation for wanting to tell you is not related to their relationship with the Bookman, but rather to sharing a secret.  Therefore, the hypothesis ""he had met the Bookman"" is not necessarily implied by the premise."	173	
1760489223	1760489224	Premise: She rubbed them away with an angry fist. She was a fool to let anyone get round her. How long before she learned that folk 'll always take advantage of weakness?  Hypothesis: folk 'll always take advantage of weakness  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that the speaker rubbed away at someone (likely a wound or a problem) with an angry fist, implying that she is trying to overcome or deal with the issue. However, it does not explicitly state that the person being addressed (referred to as ""them"") will take advantage of her weakness.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a broader statement that ""folk will always take advantage of weakness."" This is a general claim that is not directly supported by the premise, which is a specific incident or action.  To make the premise entail the hypothesis, it would need to include language or context that explicitly states that the person being addressed will take advantage of her weakness. For example: ""She rubbed them away with an angry fist, but folk will always take advantage of weakness like that."" In this revised premise, the hypothesis is implied."	186	
1760489224	1760489226	Premise: At length she decided that there was nothing to be gained by worrying her. Probably there was some quite innocent explanation, which Roger Kenyon would give her when she returned the wallet - if, indeed, it were his. And yet why had his manner changed so abruptly when he learned that the girl whose hat he had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage?  Hypothesis: the girl whose hat Roger Kenyon had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"The premise ""At length she decided that there was nothing to be gained by worrying her. Probably there was some quite innocent explanation, which Roger Kenyon would give her when she returned the wallet - if, indeed, it were his"" suggests that the girl is trying to resolve the mystery of the lost wallet, and she is likely to be disappointed if it's not found to belong to Roger Kenyon.  The hypothesis ""the girl whose hat Roger Kenyon had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage"" is not entailed by the premise. The premise does not provide any information about Roger Kenyon's relationship to the girl or the location of Sunset Cottage. The hypothesis is making an assumption about the girl's connection to Roger Kenyon and the location of the cottage that is not supported by the premise.  In fact, the premise actually contradicts the hypothesis, as the girl is trying to resolve the mystery of the wallet, not the girl who lives at Sunset Cottage. The premise implies that the girl is trying to figure out if the wallet belongs to Roger Kenyon, not that she is the one living at Sunset Cottage."	228	
1760489226	1760489228	Premise: Anna looked at Peter again and said to herself in a guilty whisper, ``Will he become even more difficult?'' She wondered if a stranger could tell that he was difficult, just by looking at him. Would such a person watching Peter now reading the prayers of Rite B in his level pleasant voice notice that resentment lay like his blood just under his skin because the life he had chosen had not turned out as he had expected it to?  Hypothesis: resentment lay just under Peter's skin  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Anna is worried about Peter becoming even more difficult and wonders if a stranger can tell that he is difficult by looking at him. This implies that Anna has observed Peter's behavior and is concerned about his potential future behavior. However, it does not provide any information about Peter's emotions or internal state.  The hypothesis states that resentment ""lay like his blood just under his skin"" due to the life he had chosen not turning out as expected. This is a subjective interpretation of Peter's emotions and is not supported by the premise. The premise does not provide any evidence that Peter is experiencing resentment or that he has chosen a life that did not turn out as expected.  In other words, the premise describes Peter's external behavior (being difficult) and Anna's perception of it, but it does not provide any insight into Peter's internal thoughts, feelings, or motivations. Therefore, we cannot infer that the hypothesis is true based on the premise."	204	
1760489228	1760489229	Premise: Jean was tough and liked to drink. She would endure for a long while yet. But what would she do when she realized that with things as they were she was on a life sentence not just a temporary suspension of essential pleasure?  Hypothesis: Jean was on a life sentence  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that Jean is tough and likes to drink, and that she can endure for a long while. It also mentions that she would endure for a long while yet. However, it does not provide any information that would lead us to conclude that she is on a life sentence.  The hypothesis states that Jean is on a life sentence, which is a specific and serious claim that is not supported by the premise. The premise does not provide any information about the nature of Jean's situation, her circumstances, or the consequences of her actions. It only describes her personality and behavior.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to provide more information, such as:  * That Jean's situation is permanent and irreversible * That she is facing a severe penalty or punishment * That she is being held against her will or under some form of confinement  Without this additional information, the premise does not provide enough evidence to support the hypothesis that Jean is on a life sentence.	207	
1760489229	1760489231	Premise: ``Clever''. Klug means ``clever''. Would you say that Abie was clever?  Hypothesis: Abie was clever  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise ""Klug means 'clever'"" does not entail the hypothesis ""Abie was clever.""  The premise provides a general definition of the word ""Klug"", which means ""clever"". However, it does not provide any information about Abie. The hypothesis ""Abie was clever"" is about the specific individual Abie, and the premise does not provide any evidence or information about Abie's abilities or characteristics.  In other words, just because ""Klug"" means ""clever"", it does not necessarily mean that Abie is clever. Abie could be a different person, or Abie could be someone who is not clever, even if the word ""Klug"" means ""clever"". The premise does not provide enough information to conclude that Abie is clever.  This is an example of a logical fallacy called ""undistributed middle"" or ""undistributed middle form"", where a general statement is applied to a specific case without sufficient evidence."	201	
1760489231	1760489231	Premise: The Susweca. It means ``dragonfly'' in Sioux, you know. Did I ever tell you that's where Paul and I met?  Hypothesis: Susweca is where she and Paul met  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise states that Susweca means ""dragonfly"" in Sioux and that you mentioned it's where you met Paul. However, it does not provide any information about whether or when or how you met Paul, or any other context that would necessarily connect the two. Therefore, the premise does not provide sufficient information to support the hypothesis that Susweca is where she and Paul met."	90	
1760489231	1760489233	Premise: How do you know? she was going to ask, but his smile was answer enough. If DeVore said there was going to be a vacancy there would be a vacancy.  Hypothesis: there was going to be a vacancy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	"No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that if DeVore said there was going to be a vacancy, then there would be a vacancy. This is a conditional statement, which is a type of logical operator. The conditional statement ""If A, then B"" is only true if A is false or B is true. However, the premise only guarantees that if DeVore makes a statement, then there will be a vacancy. It does not guarantee that DeVore will make a statement, or that the statement will be true.  In other words, the premise only guarantees a consequence (vacancy) under a specific condition (DeVore making a statement), but it does not guarantee the condition itself (DeVore making a statement). Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  To make the premise entail the hypothesis, it would need to be rephrased to something like: ""If DeVore makes a statement, then there will be a vacancy."" This revised statement would ensure that if DeVore makes a statement, then there will be a vacancy, which would make the premise entail the hypothesis."	231	
1760489233	1760489235	Premise: She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked. Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit, then came out and was not very successful in finding a job to suit him. That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them.  Hypothesis: it was Edward's fault  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.   The premise presents a situation where Edward has trouble finding a job after leaving the Engineers, but it does not directly state that Edward's actions or decisions caused his unemployment. In fact, the text explicitly states that it wasn't Edward's fault, which suggests that the issue is not his responsibility.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that Edward's fault is the cause of his unemployment. However, the premise does not provide enough information to support this claim, and the text actually implies that Nenna is more likely to blame others for Edward's situation, not Edward himself.  To entitle the premise to the hypothesis, more information would be needed to support the idea that Edward's actions or decisions led to his unemployment. The current premise is more focused on Nenna's skepticism and concern for Edward's situation, rather than making a direct causal connection between Edward's actions and his joblessness.	192
