1760487399	1760487401	Premise: No Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq Yet.  Hypothesis: Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that no Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) have been found in Iraq yet. This implies that there has been a search or investigation for WMDs in Iraq, but so far, no evidence of their existence has been discovered.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that WMDs have been found in Iraq. This is the exact opposite of what the premise states, which means that the hypothesis cannot be logically deduced from the premise.  In other words, the premise provides information about the absence of WMDs, while the hypothesis makes a positive claim about the presence of WMDs. These two statements are mutually exclusive, and therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.	160	
1760487401	1760487401	Premise: A place of sorrow, after Pope John Paul II died, became a place of celebration, as Roman Catholic faithful gathered in downtown Chicago to mark the installation of new Pope Benedict XVI.  Hypothesis: Pope Benedict XVI is the new leader of the Roman Catholic Church.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Pope John Paul II died, and people gathered in downtown Chicago to mark the installation of a new Pope. However, it does not provide any information about the identity of the new Pope. The hypothesis assumes that the new Pope is Benedict XVI, which is not supported by the premise.  The correct inference would be that the new Pope is likely to be the person who was to be installed, but the premise does not provide enough information to confirm that Benedict XVI is the new Pope.	113	
1760487401	1760487403	Premise: Herceptin was already approved to treat the sickest breast cancer patients, and the company said, Monday, it will discuss with federal regulators the possibility of prescribing the drug for more breast cancer patients.  Hypothesis: Herceptin can be used to treat breast cancer.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Herceptin was already approved to treat the sickest breast cancer patients, but it does not say that Herceptin can treat breast cancer in general. It only specifies that it is approved for the sickest patients.  The hypothesis is that Herceptin can be used to treat breast cancer, which is a more general claim that is not necessarily supported by the premise. The premise only provides information about the approval of Herceptin for a specific subgroup of breast cancer patients (the sickest ones), and does not provide any information about its effectiveness or safety in treating all breast cancer patients.  To make the hypothesis follow from the premise, additional information would be needed, such as ""Herceptin has been shown to be effective in treating breast cancer"" or ""Herceptin has been proven to be safe and effective in treating all breast cancer patients""."	189	
1760487403	1760487404	Premise: Judie Vivian, chief executive at ProMedica, a medical service company that helps sustain the 2-year-old Vietnam Heart Institute in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), said that so far about 1,500 children have received treatment.  Hypothesis: The previous name of Ho Chi Minh City was Saigon.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the 2-year-old Vietnam Heart Institute is located in Ho Chi Minh City, which is formerly known as Saigon. However, it does not provide any information about the previous name of the Vietnam Heart Institute itself. The premise only mentions the location of the institute, which is Ho Chi Minh City, and its former name.  Therefore, the hypothesis that the previous name of Ho Chi Minh City was Saigon is not a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the premise. The premise does not provide any information about the Vietnam Heart Institute's name, so we cannot make any inferences about its name.	138	
1760487404	1760487405	Premise: A man is due in court later charged with the murder 26 years ago of a teenager whose case was the first to be featured on BBC One's Crimewatch. Colette Aram, 16, was walking to her boyfriend's house in Keyworth, Nottinghamshire, on 30 October 1983 when she disappeared. Her body was later found in a field close to her home. Paul Stewart Hutchinson, 50, has been charged with murder and is due before Nottingham magistrates later.  Hypothesis: Paul Stewart Hutchinson is accused of having stabbed a girl.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Paul Stewart Hutchinson is charged with the murder of Colette Aram 26 years ago, and that her body was found in a field close to her home. Given that Colette was 16 years old when she disappeared and was found dead, it is highly likely that she was stabbed, as this is a common method of murder for a teenager at that age. Therefore, the hypothesis that Paul Stewart Hutchinson is accused of stabbing a girl follows logically from the given information.	109	
1760487405	1760487406	Premise: Britain said, Friday, that it has barred cleric, Omar Bakri, from returning to the country from Lebanon, where he was released by police after being detained for 24 hours.  Hypothesis: Bakri was briefly detained, but was released.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Britain has barred Omar Bakri from returning to the country, which implies that he was not allowed to leave Lebanon. However, the hypothesis states that Bakri was briefly detained, but was released, which suggests that he was allowed to leave Lebanon. The two statements are mutually exclusive, and the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.	84	
1760487406	1760487407	Premise: Nearly 4 million children who have at least one parent who entered the U.S. illegally were born in the United States and are U.S. citizens as a result, according to the study conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center. That's about three quarters of the estimated 5.5 million children of illegal immigrants inside the United States, according to the study. About 1.8 million children of undocumented immigrants live in poverty, the study found.  Hypothesis: Three quarters of U.S. illegal immigrants have children.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that nearly 4 million children of U.S. illegal immigrants (i.e., children of undocumented immigrants) were born in the United States and are U.S. citizens. This implies that the children of undocumented immigrants are U.S. citizens.  However, the hypothesis states that three quarters of U.S. illegal immigrants have children. This is a different claim that does not follow from the premise. The premise does not provide any information about the number of U.S. illegal immigrants, only the number of their children who are U.S. citizens.  To make the hypothesis follow from the premise, additional information would be needed to establish a relationship between the number of U.S. illegal immigrants and the number of their children.	160	
1760487407	1760487408	Premise: Like the United States, U.N. officials are also dismayed that Aristide killed a conference called by Prime Minister Robert Malval in Port-au-Prince in hopes of bringing all the feuding parties together.  Hypothesis: Aristide had Prime Minister Robert Malval  murdered in Port-au-Prince.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that U.N. officials are dismayed that Aristide killed a conference called by Prime Minister Robert Malval in Port-au-Prince. However, the hypothesis suggests that Aristide killed Prime Minister Robert Malval.  The premise does not provide any information that links Aristide to the murder of Prime Minister Malval. In fact, it states that Aristide is dismayed by the conference being killed, implying that someone else might have been responsible for the conference's demise. Therefore, we cannot infer that Aristide was involved in the murder.  The premise sets up a situation where a conference is being disrupted or terminated, but it does not provide any evidence to suggest that Aristide was responsible for the termination. The hypothesis is not supported by the premise and is an unwarranted leap.	174	
1760487408	1760487409	Premise: WASHINGTON --  A newly declassified narrative of the Bush administration's advice to the CIA on harsh interrogations shows that the small group of Justice Department lawyers who wrote memos authorizing controversial interrogation techniques were operating not on their own but with direction from top administration officials, including then-Vice President Dick Cheney and national security adviser Condoleezza Rice. At the same time, the narrative suggests that then-Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and then-Secretary of State Colin Powell were largely left out of the decision-making process.  Hypothesis: Dick Cheney was the Vice President of Bush.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise. The premise states that the small group of Justice Department lawyers who wrote memos authorizing controversial interrogation techniques were operating ""not on their own but with direction from top administration officials, including then-Vice President Dick Cheney and national security adviser Condoleezza Rice.""  The hypothesis states that Dick Cheney was the Vice President of Bush. Since the premise specifically mentions that Cheney was one of the top administration officials directing the Justice Department lawyers, it logically follows that Cheney was indeed the Vice President of Bush."	109	
1760487409	1760487410	Premise: Only a week after it had no comment on upping the storage capacity of its Hotmail e-mail service, Microsoft early Thursday announced it was boosting the allowance to 250MB to follow similar moves by rivals such as Google, Yahoo, and Lycos.  Hypothesis: Microsoft's Hotmail has raised its storage capacity to 250MB.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise states that Microsoft had no comment on upping the storage capacity of its Hotmail e-mail service just a week prior to the announcement. However, the announcement of a 250MB increase in storage capacity directly addresses the lack of comment, implying that the company was indeed considering or planning to make such an update. The fact that it took action shortly after the initial silence suggests that the premise's lack of comment was a deliberate delay or hesitation, and the announcement is a response to this perceived need for change.	114	1.0
1760487410	1760487411	Premise: Lina Joy, 42, was born Azlina Jailani to Malay parents, and was raised as a Muslim. Malaysia's constitution guarantees freedom of religion, but by law, all ethnic Malays are Muslim. Joy converted to Christianity at age 26, and after some bureaucratic difficulties had her named legally changed in 1999. However, on her MyKad national ID, the National Registration Department retained her stated religion as Islam. In order to have her religion changed, the National Registration Department said Joy would have to obtain a certificate of apostasy from the Muslim Sharia Court.  Hypothesis: Lina Joy's parents are from Malaysia.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Lina Joy was born Azlina Jailani to Malay parents, which implies that her parents are Malay. However, it does not provide any information about Lina Joy's parents' religion or their connection to Malaysia. The hypothesis assumes that Lina Joy's parents are from Malaysia, but this is not a logical conclusion based on the given premise.  The premise only provides information about Lina Joy's personal life, her conversion to Christianity, and the bureaucratic difficulties she faced in changing her religion on her ID. It does not provide any information about her parents' nationality, ethnicity, or their connection to Malaysia.	140	
1760487411	1760487412	Premise: November 9, 1989 , the day the Berlin Wall fell and the world changed forever . Not even the most astute saw it coming . As Hungary's foreign minister in the late summer of 1989 , Gyula Horn gave the order to let visiting East Germans use his country to do a 400-mile end run around the Berlin Wall , a move now seen as the beginning of the end for hard-line communism in Europe .  Hypothesis: The Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise mentions that Gyula Horn, Hungary's foreign minister, gave the order to let East Germans use Hungary as a route to travel to the West, which is a specific event that occurred in the late summer of 1989. However, the premise does not imply that the Berlin Wall was torn down. In fact, the Berlin Wall did not fall until November 9, 1989, more than a month after the event described in the premise.  The premise provides context and background information, but it does not provide direct evidence that the Berlin Wall was torn down. The hypothesis requires a direct causal link between the event described in the premise and the outcome (the Berlin Wall being torn down), which is not established. Therefore, the hypothesis is not supported by the premise.	170	
1760487412	1760487414	"Premise: Valero Energy Corp., on Monday, said it found ""extensive"" additional damage at its 250,000-barrel-per-day Port Arthur refinery.  Hypothesis: Valero Energy Corp. produces 250,000 barrels per day.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Valero Energy Corp. found ""extensive"" additional damage at its 250,000-barrel-per-day Port Arthur refinery. This implies that the damage is related to the refinery's capacity to process oil, but it does not necessarily imply that the refinery produces 250,000 barrels per day.  The hypothesis states that Valero Energy Corp. produces 250,000 barrels per day, which is a specific claim about the refinery's production capacity. The premise does not provide any information about the refinery's actual production capacity, only that it has damage, which could be due to various reasons such as maintenance, accidents, or other issues.  Therefore, the hypothesis is not supported by the premise, and it is not a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the given information."	174	
1760487414	1760487415	Premise: Oil prices fall back as Yukos oil threat lifted  Hypothesis: Oil prices rise.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the ""Yukos oil threat"" has been lifted, implying that there is no longer a significant concern or risk associated with Yukos oil. This suggests that the threat has been alleviated, which would likely lead to an increase in oil prices as the market perceives the situation as more stable.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that oil prices will rise, which is the opposite of what would be expected if the Yukos threat had been lifted. The lifting of the threat would likely lead to increased supply and reduced uncertainty, which would put downward pressure on oil prices, not drive them up.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise."	153	
1760487415	1760487416	Premise: Brian Brohm, the Louisville quarterback, threw for 368 yards and five touchdowns as the Cardinals beat visiting Oregon State 63-27.  Hypothesis: The quarterback threw for 413 yards and three touchdowns, and then ran to the end zone two more times.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Brian Brohm threw for 368 yards and five touchdowns, but it does not provide any information about his rushing performance. The hypothesis, on the other hand, specifies that Brohm threw for 413 yards and three touchdowns, and then ran to the end zone two more times. This additional information about rushing performance is not supported by the premise.  Therefore, the hypothesis is not a logical consequence of the premise, and we cannot conclude that it is true based on the information provided.	114	
1760487416	1760487417	"Premise: Greg Page, a former heavyweight boxing champion who suffered a severe brain injury in a 2001 fight, has died at 50. His wife Patricia said the one-time WBA champion had died at his home in Kentucky, USA, of complications related to injuries he suffered in the fight. Page was in a coma for a week after the 9 March 2001 fight against Dale Crowe which was stopped in the 10th round. Patricia Page said he was ""in a better place now"" after announcing on Monday he had died overnight in his sleep.  Hypothesis: Greg Page was a WBA champion.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Greg Page was a former heavyweight boxing champion who suffered a severe brain injury in a 2001 fight. However, it does not specify that he was a WBA champion. The hypothesis assumes that he was a WBA champion, but the premise does not provide any information that would confirm this.  The information about the fight and the brain injury is consistent with the premise, but the specific championship title is not mentioned. Therefore, the hypothesis that Greg Page was a WBA champion is not supported by the premise.	120	
1760487417	1760487418	"Premise: Sierra is likely to remain in jail at the Hillsborough County jail in her native Tampa until her next hearing on December 20, where she is being held without bail, which would prevent her attending the Washington event on Friday even if she still had permission to perform. Sierra has been in jail since the start of the month after an altercation with police officers outside a Tampa nightclub, which she had been ejected from. She is charged with disorderly intoxication and resisting arrest.  Hypothesis: Sierra once reached the finals of ""American Idol"".  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that Sierra is likely to remain in jail until her next hearing on December 20, and that she was ejected from a Tampa nightclub. It does not mention anything about her past experiences, such as her singing career or her participation in ""American Idol"". The hypothesis that she once reached the finals of ""American Idol"" is unrelated to the information provided in the premise and is not logically supported by it."	95	
1760487418	1760487419	Premise: Since 1987, however, Brazil has taken steps to dramatically reduce the destruction, including stepped-up enforcement and the elimination of tax incentives that led to large-scale land clearing.  Hypothesis: In the early 1990s Brazil began to take action to save the rainforest.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise states that since 1987, Brazil has taken steps to dramatically reduce the destruction of the rainforest. This indicates that the country has made efforts to address the problem of rainforest destruction.   The hypothesis states that in the early 1990s, Brazil began to take action to save the rainforest, which is a specific and more detailed claim about the nature and timing of these efforts. Since the premise mentions the period of 1987 as the starting point for these efforts, it is reasonable to infer that the early 1990s is a plausible time for these actions to have begun, given that it is several years after the initial steps were taken.	146	
1760487419	1760487420	"Premise: FIFA has received 11 bids to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments, an international football competition contested by the men's national teams. The countries vying to host the tournament are Australia, England, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Qatar, Russia, South Korea and United States, who have individual bids and the joint bids are from Belgium-Netherlands and Spain-Portugal.  Select bids are for 2018 and 2022 tournaments and two bids are just for the 2022 tournament. Qatar and South Korea are vying just for the 2022 tournament. The two winning bids will be chosen on December 2010 by the 24-man executive committee of FIFA.  Said FIFA president Sepp Blatter: ""We are very pleased about the fantastic level of interest in our flagship competition, with all initial bidders confirming their candidature.""  Hypothesis: Sepp Blatter is the president of FIFA.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that ""The countries vying to host the tournament are Australia, England, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Qatar, Russia, South Korea and United States, who have individual bids and the joint bids are from Belgium-Netherlands and Spain-Portugal.""  The hypothesis states that Sepp Blatter is the president of FIFA. The premise mentions ""FIFA president Sepp Blatter"" in the same sentence as the statement about the countries bidding to host the tournament. This implies that Sepp Blatter is indeed the president of FIFA, as the premise explicitly mentions him in this context.  Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise."	142	
1760487420	1760487421	Premise: U.S. crude settled $1.32 lower at $42.83 a barrel.  Hypothesis: Crude the light American lowered to the closing 1.32 dollars, to 42.83 dollars the barrel.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that U.S. crude ""settled"" at $1.32 lower, which implies that the price of crude decreased by $1.32. However, the hypothesis states that crude ""lowered"" to $42.83, which implies that the price of crude decreased, but it does not specify the amount of the decrease.  The word ""lowered"" can also mean to become less than or to decrease, but it doesn't necessarily imply a specific amount. In contrast, ""settled"" implies a specific amount, which is $1.32 lower.  Therefore, the hypothesis is not a logical consequence of the premise, as it does not provide enough information about the magnitude of the decrease."	159	
1760487421	1760487422	Premise: WINNENDEN, Germany ―A teenage gunman killed 15 people, most of them female, on Wednesday in a rampage that began at a school near Stuttgart in southern Germany and ended in a nearby town, where he then killed himself after the police wounded him. The attack left Germany, which tightened tough gun controls after a similar attack at a school seven years ago, struggling to understand the carnage that had again befallen it, a country with relatively little violent crime. In 2002, a gunman killed 16 people before killing himself at a school in Erfurt, in eastern Germany.  Hypothesis: In 2002 near Stuttgart a boy shot 16 people.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that in 2002, a gunman killed 16 people before killing himself at a school in Erfurt, in eastern Germany. However, the hypothesis claims that it was a boy who shot 16 people. The premise does not specify the age or gender of the gunman, so we cannot conclude that the gunman was a boy.  The correct interpretation of the premise is that a gunman, whose gender is not specified, killed 16 people in 2002. The hypothesis, therefore, is too specific and does not follow from the premise.	125	
1760487422	1760487423	Premise: Many hopes are riding on the sale of Talisman's holdings in Palm Beach and Hendry counties, which Vice President Al Gore announced with much fanfare last year at the 50th anniversary of Everglades National Park.  Hypothesis: Everglades National Park is located in Florida.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that many hopes are riding on the sale of Talisman's holdings in Palm Beach and Hendry counties. The hypothesis is that Everglades National Park is located in Florida.   In this case, the location of Talisman's holdings (in Palm Beach and Hendry counties) is consistent with the location of Everglades National Park. Palm Beach and Hendry counties are both located in Florida, which is a state that is home to Everglades National Park. Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise.	118	
1760487423	1760487425	Premise: Rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy and ultimately death. Early symptoms of rabies in humans are nonspecific, consisting of fever, headache, and general malaise.  Hypothesis: Rabies is fatal in humans.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy and ultimately death. However, it does not explicitly state that the infection is fatal. The premise only mentions that the virus causes encephalopathy and death, but it does not rule out the possibility of non-fatal cases.  In fact, the premise implies that the virus has a fatal outcome, but the word ""ultimately"" suggests that this outcome may not be immediate. The premise could be true for some cases, but not all cases, and the hypothesis of ""Rabies is fatal in humans"" is a stronger claim that requires additional evidence to support it.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise, and more evidence would be needed to support it."	169	
1760487425	1760487426	Premise: American tobacco companies were showing a profit most quarters due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products sold including food.  Hypothesis: PM often entered markets with both cigarettes and food.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that American tobacco companies were showing a profit most quarters due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products sold including food. This implies that the companies were generating profits through the sale of cigarettes and food products, but it does not necessarily imply that PM (presumably Philip Morris, a tobacco company) specifically entered markets with both cigarettes and food.  The premise only mentions that American tobacco companies were diversifying their product offerings to include food, but it does not specify which companies were doing this or which products they were entering. The hypothesis makes a specific claim about PM's business strategy, which is not supported by the premise.	141	
1760487426	1760487427	Premise: The development of agriculture by early humans, roughly 10,000 years ago, was also harmful to many natural ecosystems as they were systematically destroyed and replaced with artificial versions.  Hypothesis: Humans existed 10,000 years ago.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the development of agriculture by early humans was harmful to many natural ecosystems, and that this happened roughly 10,000 years ago. However, this premise does not provide any information about the existence of humans 10,000 years ago.  The existence of humans 10,000 years ago is a claim that is not supported by the premise. In fact, the premise suggests that the opposite may be true: that humans did not exist 10,000 years ago, or at least that they did not exist in their current form.  The premise is more consistent with the hypothesis that agriculture began after humans existed, and that it had a significant impact on the environment. Therefore, the hypothesis that humans existed 10,000 years ago is not logically entailed by the premise.	173	
1760487427	1760487428	Premise: The two young leaders of the coup, Pibul Songgram and Pridi Phanomyang, both educated in Europe and influenced by Western ideas, came to dominate Thai politics in the ensuing years.  Hypothesis: Pibul was a young leader.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that Pibul Songgram and Pridi Phanomyang are the two young leaders of the coup, but it does not provide any information that suggests Pibul is the younger of the two. In fact, the word ""young"" is used to describe both leaders, so it's possible that Pridi is the younger of the two."	87	
1760487428	1760487429	"Premise: Lin Piao, after all, was the creator of Mao's ""Little Red Book"" of quotations.  Hypothesis: Lin Piao wrote the ""Little Red Book"".  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Lin Piao was the creator of Mao's ""Little Red Book"" of quotations, but it does not imply that Lin Piao wrote the ""Little Red Book"" himself. The word ""creator"" typically implies the originator or designer of something, not necessarily the author or writer.  A more accurate hypothesis would be: ""Lin Piao was the author of Mao's 'Little Red Book' of quotations."" This hypothesis follows more closely from the premise, as it makes a specific claim about Lin Piao's role in the creation of the book, rather than just stating that he was its creator."	138	
1760487429	1760487430	Premise: When patients interrupt a course of antibiotics, the surviving bacteria return with a vengeance, often having rapidly mutated to resist the therapy.  Hypothesis: Bacteria is winning the war against antibiotics.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that when patients interrupt a course of antibiotics, the surviving bacteria return with a vengeance, often having rapidly mutated to resist the therapy. This implies that the antibiotics are effective against the bacteria, at least initially, and that the bacteria can survive and adapt when the therapy is interrupted.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that the bacteria are ""winning the war against antibiotics."" This implies that the antibiotics are ineffective or are being outmaneuvered by the bacteria, which is not necessarily supported by the premise.  The premise does not provide evidence that the antibiotics are ultimately failing to eradicate the bacteria or that the bacteria are superior in some way. It only describes a specific scenario where the bacteria can survive and adapt when the therapy is interrupted. Therefore, the hypothesis is not a logical consequence of the premise."	180	
1760487430	1760487432	Premise: Initially the Bundesbank opposed the introduction of the euro but was compelled to accept it in light of the political pressure of the capitalist politicians who supported its introduction.  Hypothesis: The introduction of the euro has been opposed.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Bundesbank opposed the introduction of the euro, but it does not necessarily mean that the introduction of the euro was opposed by everyone, including the capitalist politicians. The phrase ""capitalist politicians"" is ambiguous and could refer to politicians who were not necessarily opposed to the introduction of the euro.  In fact, many capitalist politicians supported the introduction of the euro, as it was seen as a way to promote economic integration and stability in Europe. The opposition to the euro was more nuanced, with some politicians and institutions, such as the Bundesbank, opposing it due to concerns about monetary policy autonomy and the potential impact on German interests.  Therefore, the hypothesis that the introduction of the euro has been opposed does not follow necessarily from the premise."	165	
1760487432	1760487433	Premise: The Armed Forces Press Committee (COPREFA) admitted that the government troops sustained 11 casualties in these clashes, adding that they inflicted three casualties on the rebels.  Hypothesis: Three rebels were killed by government troops.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the government troops sustained 11 casualties in the clashes and inflicted three casualties on the rebels. However, it does not provide any information about the number of rebels who were killed. The fact that the government troops inflicted three casualties on the rebels does not necessarily mean that three rebels were killed. It's possible that the three casualties inflicted by the government troops were rebels who were wounded or injured, rather than killed.  To conclude that three rebels were killed, we would need more information, such as the fact that the three casualties inflicted by the government troops were fatalities, or that the rebels were the only ones who sustained casualties. As it stands, the premise only provides information about the government troops' casualties and their own inflicted casualties, but not about the rebels' casualties.	170	1.0
1760487433	1760487435	Premise: One economic study will not be the basis of Canada's public policy decisions, but Easton's research does conclusively show that there are economic benefits in the legalization of marijuana.  Hypothesis: Drug legalization has benefits.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that one economic study will not be the basis of Canada's public policy decisions, but Easton's research does conclusively show that there are economic benefits in the legalization of marijuana. This premise implies that the study itself is not a basis for policy decisions, but rather that Easton's research is one of many studies that demonstrate the economic benefits of marijuana legalization.  The hypothesis, ""Drug legalization has benefits,"" is too broad and doesn't necessarily follow from the premise. The premise only mentions Easton's research as one example of a study showing economic benefits, but it does not guarantee that all studies will show benefits or that the benefits are universal. The premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that drug legalization has benefits in general.  To make the hypothesis follow from the premise, additional information would be needed to show that Easton's research is representative of all studies on the topic, or that the benefits of marijuana legalization are consistent across different studies and contexts."	211	
1760487435	1760487436	Premise: Archaeologists have found approximately 30 beautifully preserved mummies in a 4,000 year old Egyptian necropolis which held 53 tombs. Supervisor of Antiquities for Middle Egypt Dr. Abdel-Rahman El-Ayedi's team established his archaeological site in the Faiyum Oasis near the El-Lahun Egyptian pyramid which is just south of Cairo. Besides the mummies, the team found masks, amulets, clay pots and an offering table located in a funerary chapel. The chapel dates back to about 30 BC to 337 AD.  Hypothesis: 30 beautifully preserved mummies have been located in the south of Cairo.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that archaeologists have found approximately 30 beautifully preserved mummies in a 4,000 year old Egyptian necropolis, which held 53 tombs. It specifically mentions that the site is located near the El-Lahun Egyptian pyramid, just south of Cairo.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that the mummies were found in the south of Cairo. However, the premise does not specify the location of the mummies in relation to Cairo. It only mentions the location of the necropolis near the El-Lahun Egyptian pyramid, which is actually located in the Faiyum Oasis, not south of Cairo.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise, as it is not supported by the information provided.	164	1.0
1760487436	1760487437	Premise: Gastrointestinal bleeding can happen as an adverse effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin or ibuprofen.  Hypothesis: Aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that gastrointestinal bleeding can happen as an adverse effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin or ibuprofen. This implies that taking these medications can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.  The hypothesis, however, claims that aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding. This is the opposite of what the premise suggests, and therefore, it does not logically follow from the premise.  In other words, the premise states that taking aspirin can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, but it does not provide any evidence to suggest that aspirin actually prevents it.	126	
1760487437	1760487438	Premise: A former employee of the company, David Vance of South Portland, said Hooper spent a lot of time on the road, often meeting with customers between Portland and Kittery.  Hypothesis: Hooper is a citizen of Portland.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that David Vance, a former employee of the company, spent a lot of time on the road, often meeting with customers between Portland and Kittery. This information provides evidence that Hooper (who is not even mentioned in the premise) is a customer, not a former employee of the company.  The hypothesis suggests that Hooper is a citizen of Portland, which is not supported by the premise at all. The premise only mentions David Vance, a former employee, and his activities on the road. There is no information about Hooper's citizenship or location.	128	
1760487438	1760487439	Premise: Cyprus, divided or not, joins the EU on the 1st of May.  Hypothesis: Cyprus was divided into two parts on May 1.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Cyprus joins the EU on May 1. This is a neutral statement about an event that has occurred. The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that Cyprus was divided into two parts on May 1, which is a specific and contrary event.  There is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise does not imply that Cyprus was divided, nor does it suggest that a division occurred on May 1. The two statements are independent and unrelated.  To make the hypothesis follow from the premise, additional information would be needed, such as a statement that Cyprus was divided before joining the EU, or a statement that the division occurred on May 1. As it stands, the premise does not provide any basis for the hypothesis.	167	
1760487439	1760487440	Premise: World leaders expressed concern on Thursday that North Korea will quit six-party nuclear disarmament talks and will  bolster its nuclear weapons arsenal.  Hypothesis: North Korea says it has a stockpile of nuclear weapons and is building more.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that world leaders are concerned that North Korea will quit six-party nuclear disarmament talks and bolster its nuclear weapons arsenal. This implies that North Korea is currently engaged in nuclear disarmament talks and is willing to continue participating in them. The premise does not provide any evidence to suggest that North Korea has a stockpile of nuclear weapons or is building more.  In fact, the premise suggests the opposite: that North Korea is abandoning the disarmament talks, which would likely lead to an increase in nuclear activity, not a decrease. Therefore, the hypothesis that North Korea has a stockpile of nuclear weapons and is building more is not a logical conclusion based on the given premise.	149	
1760487440	1760487442	Premise: In addition to establishing the electoral commission, the laws also concern nationality, a contentious issue since citizenship laws were tightened to exclude one of Gbagbo's main competitors from the 2000 presidential race, former prime minister Alassane Ouattara.  Hypothesis: Gbagbo is a competitor of Ouattara.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the laws concern nationality, specifically excluding one of Gbagbo's main competitors from the 2000 presidential race. It does not provide any information about Gbagbo's own nationality or relationship to the law. The hypothesis, however, assumes that Gbagbo is a competitor of Ouattara, which is not directly supported by the premise.  The premise only mentions that the laws concern Ouattara's exclusion from the presidential race, but it does not provide any information about Gbagbo's role or relationship to the law. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Gbagbo is a competitor of Ouattara based on the premise.	145	
1760487442	1760487443	Premise: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace Prize, though he was nominated for it five times between 1937 and 1948.  Hypothesis: Mohandas received the Nobel Prize in 1989.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Mohandas Gandhi was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize five times between 1937 and 1948, but it does not state that he received the prize. The hypothesis claims that he received the prize in 1989, which is more than 40 years after the given time period.  The premise only provides information about the nomination period, but it does not provide any information about the outcome of those nominations. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Gandhi received the prize in 1989 based on the premise.	119	
1760487443	1760487444	Premise: The Christian Democrats (CDU) won 35.2% of the vote, or 225 seats, against 34.3% for Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats (SPD).  Hypothesis: It seems unlikely that there will be a coalition between Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats and Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that the Christian Democrats (CDU) won 35.2% of the vote and the Social Democrats (SPD) won 34.3% of the vote. This indicates a relatively close election, but it does not provide any information about the CDU's performance in the Bundestag (the German parliament).   In fact, the CDU won 225 seats, while the SPD won an unknown number of seats. The premise does not mention the CDU's performance in the Bundestag, which is necessary to determine whether a coalition between the CDU and SPD is likely or unlikely.   Therefore, the hypothesis that there will not be a coalition between the CDU and SPD cannot be concluded from the given premise.	162	
1760487444	1760487445	Premise: Edward VIII became King in January of 1936 and abdicated in December.  Hypothesis: King Edward VIII abdicated in December 1936.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Edward VIII became King in January 1936 and abdicated in December of the same year. However, the hypothesis states that he abdicated in December 1936, which is the same year mentioned in the premise. This would imply that the abdication occurred after the beginning of the year, but the premise specifies that he became King in January, which would mean that he abdicated before the end of the year.  Therefore, the hypothesis is not logically consistent with the premise.	118	
1760487445	1760487446	"Premise: Australian Guantanamo Bay detainee David Hicks has won British citizenship, opening the door for a possible bid to have him freed from the US detention facility in Cuba. Justice Lawrence Collins of the British High Court has overturned the British Government's refusal of citizenship to Hicks, whose mother was born in England. Justice Collins said the Government had ""no power to withhold or deprive citizenship"". Justice Collins said: ""In my view it would be improper to fail to give assistance which otherwise would have been given, simply because the claimant was believed to be involved in terrorism and has not had any previous connection with this country."" Hicks' lawyer, Stephen Grosz, said the decision was a breakthrough. He said there was now no reason why Hicks should not enjoy the same protection as the nine other British citizens released without charge from Guantanamo Bay on representations of the British Government.  Hypothesis: Stephen Grosz is the British lawyer of David Hicks.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that David Hicks has won British citizenship and that Justice Collins has overturned the British Government's refusal of citizenship to Hicks, whose mother was born in England. It also mentions that Justice Collins said the Government had ""no power to withhold or deprive citizenship"".  The hypothesis states that Stephen Grosz is the British lawyer of David Hicks. However, there is no information in the premise that links Stephen Grosz to David Hicks. The premise only mentions Hicks' citizenship and Justice Collins' decision, but does not mention Grosz's role in Hicks' case.  Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that Grosz is Hicks' lawyer based on the information provided in the premise."	149	
1760487446	1760487447	Premise: Rockweed has been harvested commercially in Nova Scotia since the late 1950's and is currently the most important commercial seaweed in Atlantic Canada.  Hypothesis: Marine vegetation is  harvested.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that rockweed has been harvested commercially in Nova Scotia since the late 1950s, which implies that it is a valuable and commercially viable crop. The hypothesis states that marine vegetation is harvested. Since rockweed is a type of marine vegetation, the premise provides sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis. Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise.	83	
1760487447	1760487447	Premise: Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has ordered security forces to take firm action against rioters following the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto. The violence has left at least 44 people dead and dozens injured. Mr. Musharraf insisted the measures were to protect people. VOA's Ayaz Gul reports from Islamabad that a bitter dispute has also erupted over how the 54-year-old politician died and who was behind her assassination.  Hypothesis: Musharraf has ordered rioters to take firm action against security forces.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that President Pervez Musharraf has ordered security forces to take firm action against rioters. However, the hypothesis suggests that it is the rioters who are taking firm action against the security forces, not the other way around.  To follow from the premise, the hypothesis would need to be rephrased to something like: ""Musharraf has ordered security forces to take firm action against rioters."" This revised hypothesis accurately reflects the information provided in the premise."	112	
1760487447	1760487448	"Premise: A month after Gov. David A. Paterson dropped his proposal for a soda tax, New York City's health commissioner has written an article advocating ""hefty"" taxes on sodas and sports drinks containing sugar. Such a tax, the article said, could be the biggest boon to public health since tobacco taxes. The commissioner, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, and Kelly D. Brownell of Yale University, his co-author, argue in the New England Journal of Medicine that a tax of a penny per ounce could reduce consumption by more than 10 percent and raise $1.2 billion a year in New York State alone.  Hypothesis: Michael Bloomberg is the mayor of New York.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise. Here's why:  The premise states that New York City's health commissioner, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, wrote an article advocating for a soda tax. The hypothesis states that Michael Bloomberg is the mayor of New York. Given that Dr. Frieden is the health commissioner of New York City, it is reasonable to infer that he is working under the administration of the mayor, which is Michael Bloomberg. Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise.	102	
1760487448	1760487449	Premise: Officials said the Finnish suspect was among the dead but did not provide a motive for the attack.  Hypothesis: Officials said that the suspect, a Finnish citizen, was among the dead.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Finnish suspect was among the dead, but it does not provide any information about the suspect's status (alive or dead) at the time of the attack. The hypothesis assumes that the suspect was dead, but the premise only confirms that the suspect is among the dead, without specifying whether they were the victim or the perpetrator.  In other words, the premise is saying that the Finnish suspect is among the dead, but it does not provide any information about their role in the attack. The hypothesis makes an assumption about the suspect's status that is not supported by the premise.	132	1.0
1760487449	1760487450	Premise: Britain agreed to lift by March 31 a 150-mile military protection zone enforced around the islands since Argentina invaded them in 1982.  Hypothesis: The military protection zone around Falklands was lifted.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Britain agreed to lift a 150-mile military protection zone around the Falklands by March 31, but it does not guarantee that the protection zone has actually been lifted. The premise only states the agreement to lift the zone, not the actual outcome.  In other words, the premise only establishes a future event (lifting the zone by March 31), but it does not provide information about whether the event has occurred or will occur. Therefore, the hypothesis that the military protection zone has been lifted is not necessarily true based on the premise.	125	
1760487450	1760487451	"Premise: The ferry owner PT Nur Budi's spokesman blamed Indonesian port authorities for the tragedy. ""The passenger capacity of the ferry is 205 people but the port administrator accepted more passengers as they thought it was possible,"" he said. The National Meteorological and Geophysics Agency, however, had published and raised an alert signal about high waves on Friday. It specifically stated that ""Saturday 10th and Sunday 11th, Indonesian waters would have witnessed storm force waves,"" but despite the dire warnings KM Teratai set for the seas.  Hypothesis: An Indonesian ferry with 300 passengers sank.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that the passenger capacity of the ferry is 205 people, but the port administrator accepted more passengers than that. However, it does not explicitly state that the ferry was carrying 300 passengers. The premise only mentions that the port administrator accepted more passengers than the ferry's capacity, but does not provide a specific number.  The hypothesis requires a direct link between the premise and the information provided. Since the premise does not mention 300 passengers, it cannot be concluded that the ferry had 300 passengers.	116	
1760487451	1760487452	Premise: Tension and battles between Greek police and anarchist demonstrators took place in the centre of Athens, Greece, during the anti-war demonstration of the 4th European Social Forum which is taking place in the Greek capital, from 4 to 7 of May 2006. The march of the approximately 1,000 anarchists ended with clashes between groups of anarchists and police. Riot police used tear gas, while a branch of a Greek bank, a fast-food store and around 50 shop windows in central Athens were damaged.  Hypothesis: The riots in Greece started on December 6.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that the anti-war demonstration of the 4th European Social Forum took place in the Greek capital, Athens, from 4 to 7 May 2006, and that there were clashes between Greek police and anarchist demonstrators during the event.   However, the hypothesis states that the riots started on December 6. The premise does not mention anything about riots or clashes happening in December 2006, so there is no connection between the premise and the hypothesis. The hypothesis appears to be unrelated to the information provided in the premise.	122	
1760487452	1760487454	Premise: Libya's case against Britain and the US concerns the dispute over their demand for extradition of Libyans charged with blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in 1988.  Hypothesis: One case involved the extradition of Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Libya's case against Britain and the US concerns the dispute over their demand for extradition of Libyans charged with blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in 1988. However, the hypothesis only mentions one case involving the extradition of Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing, without specifying that it is part of the broader dispute.  To follow from the premise, the hypothesis would need to include information that it is part of the larger dispute, such as ""One case involving the extradition of Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing is part of Libya's broader dispute with Britain and the US over their demand for extradition of Libyans charged with blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in 1988."""	164	
1760487454	1760487455	Premise: Argentina sought help from Britain on its privatization program and encouraged British investment.  Hypothesis: Argentina sought UK expertise on privatization and agriculture.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Argentina sought help from Britain on its privatization program and encouraged British investment. This implies that Argentina was looking for assistance in implementing or implementing a privatization program, likely in various sectors, including possibly agriculture.  The hypothesis, however, states that Argentina sought UK expertise on privatization and agriculture. While the premise does mention privatization, it does not specify that the expertise was needed for agriculture. The hypothesis assumes that the UK expertise was specifically requested for both privatization and agriculture, which is not directly supported by the premise.  A more accurate hypothesis would be: ""Argentina sought UK expertise on privatization and possibly agriculture as part of its privatization program."" This revised hypothesis is more closely aligned with the information provided in the premise."	164	
1760487455	1760487456	Premise: Instead of action on crime, we got the federal long gun registry, which became a bloated bureaucratic nightmare to responsible hunters, farmers and rural Canadians. It cost taxpayers some CA$2 billion and it hasn't done a thing to reduce gun crime. said Harper. The Conservatives have provided amnesty for unregistered gun owners. At this time there is no legislation set before the House of Commons. Conservative Garry Breitkreuz from Saskatchewan tabled the bill killing the long-gun registry.  Hypothesis: Garry Breitkreuz is a member of the Conservative Party.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that the Conservative Party has taken action to address gun crime by providing amnesty for unregistered gun owners and tabling a bill to kill the long-gun registry. It specifically mentions that Conservative Garry Breitkreuz from Saskatchewan tabled the bill.  The hypothesis is that Garry Breitkreuz is a member of the Conservative Party. This conclusion logically follows from the information provided in the premise, as the premise directly attributes the action of tabling the bill to a Conservative MP (Garry Breitkreuz), which is a characteristic of a Conservative MP.	127	
1760487456	1760487458	Premise: The researchers in the latest study fed one group of mice a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat. The diet started when the mice, all males, were 1 year old, which is middle-age in mouse longevity. As expected, the mice soon developed signs of impending diabetes, with grossly enlarged livers, and started to die much sooner than mice fed a standard diet.  Hypothesis: At the age of one year, male mice were fed with a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the mice were fed a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat, starting at the age of 1 year. However, the hypothesis only mentions the age at which the mice were fed the diet (1 year) and the composition of the diet (60% fat), but does not mention the fact that the mice developed signs of impending diabetes and started to die sooner than mice on a standard diet.  The hypothesis seems to be a statement of fact, rather than a prediction or explanation for the observed outcome. The premise sets the stage for the hypothesis, but the hypothesis itself does not logically follow from the premise. To make the hypothesis follow from the premise, it would need to include the additional information about the observed outcome (e.g. ""At the age of one year, male mice fed with a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat developed signs of impending diabetes and started to die much sooner than mice fed a standard diet"")."	210	
1760487458	1760487459	Premise: The soldiers, who were said to have been wearing Arab headdress, were accused of firing at Iraqi police when stopped at a road block.  Hypothesis: The soldiers were driving a civilian car and were dressed in civilian clothes when a shooting took place between them and Iraqi patrols.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the soldiers were wearing Arab headdress, but it does not rule out the possibility that they were also wearing other types of headgear or uniforms. Similarly, it does not imply that they were wearing civilian clothes.  In fact, the hypothesis suggests that they were wearing civilian clothes, which is not supported by the premise. The premise only mentions Arab headdress, not civilian clothes.  To make the hypothesis follow from the premise, additional information would be needed to rule out the possibility that the soldiers were wearing uniforms or other types of headgear that could be mistaken for Arab headdress.	134	
1760487459	1760487460	"Premise: The United States would like to see U.N. weapons inspectors return to Iraq providing the Iraqis take concrete, affirmative and demonstrable actions ""to show full co-operation"" Clinton said.  Hypothesis: U.N. weapons inspectors could stay in Iraq, Clinton said.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the United States wants U.N. weapons inspectors to return to Iraq, but it does not require that the inspectors actually stay. The phrase ""to show full co-operation"" suggests that the inspectors' presence in Iraq is contingent upon the Iraqis' willingness to cooperate with them.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, makes a stronger claim that the inspectors will stay in Iraq, which is not necessarily implied by the premise. The premise only mentions the inspectors' return, not their continued presence.  To make the hypothesis follow from the premise, the hypothesis would need to be revised to something like: ""The U.N. weapons inspectors will stay in Iraq if the Iraqis take concrete, affirmative, and demonstrable actions to show full co-operation."" This revised hypothesis would be a more direct consequence of the premise."	180	
1760487460	1760487461	Premise: On 12 August, the San Carlos Battalion came across mines placed in their path and one soldier was killed while two were seriously injured. Meanwhile on 10 August, urban commandos took a patrol car by surprise and dropped a grenade inside the car, injuring four and partially destroying the vehicle.  Hypothesis: A patrol car was attacked by the San Carlos Battalion.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the San Carlos Battalion encountered mines and that urban commandos took a patrol car by surprise and dropped a grenade inside it. There is no mention of the San Carlos Battalion attacking a patrol car. The hypothesis, however, assumes that the San Carlos Battalion was the one that attacked the patrol car. The premise only describes the events from the perspective of the San Carlos Battalion, but it does not provide any information that would suggest they were the attackers.	105	
1760487461	1760487462	Premise: Bomb-sniffing dogs were brought to Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment.  Hypothesis: Bomb-sniffing dogs were estimated at Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that bomb-sniffing dogs were brought to Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment. This suggests that the dogs are present at the apartment, but it does not provide any information about their purpose or the results of their presence.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that bomb-sniffing dogs were estimated at Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment. The word ""estimated"" implies that some sort of measurement or assessment was taken of the dogs, but it is unclear what this assessment was or what it revealed.  Since the premise only mentions the presence of the dogs, but not the outcome or purpose of their presence, the hypothesis makes an unwarranted assumption about the results of their presence. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise."	169	
1760487462	1760487464	Premise: Startling new research into mobile phones claims they may reduce a man's sperm count by up to 30%.  Hypothesis: Male fertility may be affected by use of a mobile phones.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that ""new research"" has found that mobile phones may reduce a man's sperm count by up to 30%. However, it does not provide any information about the relationship between mobile phone use and sperm count.  To establish a connection between the premise and the hypothesis, the premise would need to include more information, such as:  * How the research was conducted (e.g. did it involve a controlled study, or a correlation analysis?) * What the sample size was * What the control group consisted of (e.g. did they also use mobile phones?) * What the methodology was to measure sperm count * What the results were based on (e.g. self-reported data, objective measurements?)  Without this information, we cannot infer that the hypothesis is supported by the premise. The premise only provides a claim about the potential effect of mobile phones on sperm count, but it does not provide any evidence to support this claim."	202	
1760487464	1760487465	Premise: Workers at the Lufthansa Technik Automotive plant in Co Dublin are due to vote today on changes to work practices being sought by the company's management. The aircraft engine maintenace firm has warned that rejection of the proposals would threaten a planned €17230m investment in the Rathcoole plant and put jobs at risk. LTA says it is not seeking any lay-offs or pay cuts and the planned investment would guarantee the future of the plant for the next 15 years. The work-practice changes are being sought following the collapse of Labour Relations Commission talks on the matter.  Hypothesis: Lufthansa Technik Automotive fires 30 workers.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Lufthansa Technik Automotive has warned that rejection of the proposed changes would threaten a planned €172.3m investment in the plant and put jobs at risk. However, it also states that the company is not seeking any lay-offs or pay cuts. Therefore, it is unlikely that the company would fire 30 workers in response to the rejection of the proposals, as it would contradict the statement that no layoffs or pay cuts are being sought.  The correct hypothesis would be more likely to be: ""Lufthansa Technik Automotive reduces the number of jobs at the plant in response to the rejection of the proposals."" This hypothesis would be a more plausible consequence of the premise, as it would align with the company's stated goal of protecting the plant's future and the workers' jobs."	177	
1760487465	1760487466	Premise: It rewrites the rules of global trade, established by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, in 1947, and modified in multiple rounds of negotiations since then.  Hypothesis: GATT was formed in 1947.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that GATT was rewritten, implying that it has undergone changes or modifications since its establishment. However, the hypothesis states that GATT was formed in 1947, which is a specific date and does not account for any changes or modifications that may have occurred over time.  The premise suggests that GATT's rules have been rewritten, but it does not provide information about the original date of GATT's establishment. Therefore, the hypothesis that GATT was formed in 1947 is not necessarily true and does not follow from the premise.	124	1.0
1760487466	1760487467	Premise: Vice President Dick Cheney on Tuesday hurled an obscenity on the Senate floor to punctuate an angry exchange with Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy as all senators gathered for their annual photo.  Hypothesis: Cheney cursed at Sen. Patrick Leahy.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Vice President Dick Cheney ""hurled an obscenity"" on the Senate floor during an exchange with Sen. Patrick Leahy. However, it does not specify that the obscenity was directed at Sen. Leahy. The hypothesis assumes that the obscenity was directed at Sen. Leahy, but this is not explicitly stated in the premise.  The premise only mentions an ""angry exchange"" between Cheney and Sen. Leahy, but it does not provide any information about the content of the exchange or what Cheney said. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the obscenity was directed at Sen. Leahy based on the given information. The hypothesis makes an assumption that is not supported by the premise."	157	
1760487467	1760487469	Premise: In the May 2005 general election Michael Howard failed to unseat the Labour Government, although the Conservatives did gain 33 seats, playing the most significant role in reducing Labour's majority from 167 to 66.  Hypothesis: In the May 2005 general election Conservatives got 33 seats.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Michael Howard failed to unseat the Labour Government, which means that the Labour Party retained power. This implies that the Conservative Party did not gain enough seats to win the election.  However, the hypothesis states that the Conservatives gained 33 seats, which is a possible outcome, but it does not necessarily mean they won the election. The fact that the Conservatives gained 33 seats does not necessarily imply that they won the election, as the Labour Party still maintained a majority.  The premise provides more information about the outcome of the election, specifically that the Labour Party retained power and the Conservative Party's performance. The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a specific claim about the number of seats gained by the Conservatives, which is not directly supported by the premise.	169	
1760487469	1760487470	Premise: The Norwegian Newspaper Corpus is a large and self-expanding corpus of Norwegian newspaper texts. The collection of this dynamic and continually growing corpus began in 1998.  Hypothesis: Dagbladet is a Norwegian newspaper.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Norwegian Newspaper Corpus is a large and self-expanding corpus of Norwegian newspaper texts, and that the collection of this corpus began in 1998. This premise provides information about the nature and origin of the corpus, but it does not provide any information about the specific newspaper that the corpus contains.  The hypothesis that ""Dagbladet is a Norwegian newspaper"" is a separate statement that is not logically supported by the premise. The premise only mentions the corpus, not the specific newspapers that it contains. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Dagbladet is a Norwegian newspaper based on the premise alone."	139	
1760487470	1760487471	Premise: The Dutch, who ruled Indonesia until 1949, called the city of Jakarta Batavia.  Hypothesis: Formerly ( until 1949 ) Batavia, Jakarta is largest city and capital of Indonesia.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Dutch ruled Indonesia until 1949, and that the city of Jakarta was called Batavia during that time. However, the hypothesis claims that Jakarta is the largest city and capital of Indonesia.  The premise only tells us about the historical name of Jakarta (Batavia) during the Dutch colonial period, but it does not provide any information about the size or status of Jakarta at that time. It also does not imply that Jakarta was (or is) the largest city and capital of Indonesia.  In fact, after Indonesia gained independence in 1949, the city was officially renamed Jakarta, and the capital was moved from Batavia to Jakarta. Since then, Jakarta has grown to become the largest city in Indonesia, but the premise does not provide any information about this.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.	185	
1760487471	1760487473	"Premise: The name for the newest James Bond film has been announced today. The 22nd film, previously known only as ""Bond 22"", will be called ""Quantum of Solace"". EON Productions who are producing the film made the announcement today at Pinewood Studios, where production for the film has been under way since last year. The name of the film was inspired by a short story (of the same name) from For Your Eyes Only by Bond creator, Ian Fleming.  Hypothesis: James Bond was created by Ian Fleming.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the 22nd James Bond film will be called ""Quantum of Solace"" and that it was inspired by a short story of the same name from ""For Your Eyes Only"" by Ian Fleming. This suggests that the title of the film is a reference to Fleming's work.  The hypothesis, however, claims that James Bond was created by Ian Fleming. While it is true that Fleming wrote the original James Bond novels and short stories, the premise does not provide any information that directly links the creation of James Bond to Fleming. The fact that the title of the film is inspired by one of Fleming's stories does not imply that Fleming created the character of James Bond.  In fact, the hypothesis is actually the opposite of what the premise suggests - the premise implies that Fleming's work is connected to the film, while the hypothesis claims that Fleming created the character of James Bond. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise."	206	
1760487473	1760487474	Premise: The gastric bypass operation, also known as stomach stapling, has become the most common surgical procedure for treating obesity.  Hypothesis: Obesity is medically treated.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the gastric bypass operation, also known as stomach stapling, is the most common surgical procedure for treating obesity. This implies that the gastric bypass operation is a treatment for obesity, but it does not provide any information about whether obesity is a medical condition that requires treatment.  The hypothesis states that obesity is medically treated, which implies that obesity is a medical condition that requires treatment. However, the premise only discusses the procedure for treating obesity, not the nature of obesity itself. Therefore, the premise does not provide sufficient information to support the hypothesis.  To support the hypothesis, additional information would be needed to establish that obesity is a medical condition that requires treatment. The premise only provides information about the treatment for obesity, not the underlying condition itself.	165	
1760487474	1760487476	Premise: The cost of the consumer of the United States fell in June.  Hypothesis: U.S. consumer spending dived in June.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the premise.  The premise states that the cost of consumers in the United States fell in June, but it does not provide any information about the overall spending of consumers. The cost of consumers refers to the expenses or expenditures of consumers, whereas consumer spending refers to the total amount spent by consumers.  The premise is about a decrease in the cost of consumers, whereas the hypothesis is about a decrease in consumer spending. These are two related but distinct concepts. A decrease in the cost of consumers does not necessarily mean that consumer spending has decreased.  For example, if the cost of consumers refers to the cost of living expenses, such as housing, food, and transportation, a decrease in these costs could lead to an increase in consumer spending if consumers choose to spend more on other goods and services to offset the reduced costs. Therefore, the hypothesis that U.S. consumer spending dived in June does not necessarily follow from the premise that the cost of consumers fell in June.	204	
1760487476	1760487477	"Premise: The former leader of Iraq was rushed to hospital last Sunday after refusing to eat for sixteen days. But according to news agencies, he has ended the hunger strike by eating lunch at the court in Baghdad. ""Saddam ate beef and rice and cola with bread which he brought from hospital,"" one source told Reuters news agency. He was fasting with three co-defendants, and they were demanding more security for their defence lawyers, three of whom have been murdered.  Hypothesis: Some Australians have fasted to protest.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise describes Saddam Hussein, the former leader of Iraq, fasting and refusing to eat for 16 days in a court in Baghdad. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that some Australians have fasted to protest. There is no connection between Saddam Hussein and Australia, and the premise does not provide any information about Australians fasting. The premise only mentions the actions of Saddam Hussein, while the hypothesis introduces a completely different group (Australians) and a different context (protesting). Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.	122	
1760487477	1760487478	Premise: Sonia Gandhi can be defeated in the next elections in India by BJP.  Hypothesis: Sonia Gandhi is defeated by BJP.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Sonia Gandhi can be defeated in the next elections in India by the BJP. However, it does not provide any information about Sonia Gandhi's candidacy or her chances of being defeated by the BJP. It only states that the BJP has the potential to defeat her.  To make the hypothesis follow from the premise, it would need to be rephrased to include more information about Sonia Gandhi's candidacy, such as ""Sonia Gandhi will be defeated by the BJP in the next elections"" or ""The BJP will defeat Sonia Gandhi in the next elections"".   Without this additional information, the hypothesis is too vague and does not logically follow from the premise."	147	
1760487478	1760487479	Premise: Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has said that Mahmoud Abbas is a man that Israel can do business with.  Hypothesis: Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, may be someone Israel can talk with.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has said that Mahmoud Abbas is a man that Israel can do business with. This implies that Sharon views Abbas as a reasonable and trustworthy individual with whom Israel can engage in negotiations and cooperation.  The hypothesis suggests that Abbas is someone Israel can talk with. This is a more specific claim than the premise, which only mentions that Israel can do business with Abbas. The hypothesis implies that this business can involve communication or dialogue, which is a key aspect of talking.  Therefore, the hypothesis is a more specific and nuanced claim that logically follows from the premise, as it builds upon the idea that Abbas is a person with whom Israel can engage in a positive and cooperative relationship.	153	
1760487479	1760487480	Premise: The Tempe Hometown Premiere will have all the trappings of a mega-Hollywood  event including red carpet arrivals, klieg lights, screaming fans, paparazzi and  media coverage of the film`s stars headed by Wolverine himself, Hugh Jackman and  including Liev Schreiber, Ryan Reynolds, Taylor Kitsch, Lynn Collins, will.i.am  and director Gavin Hood.  Following a hard-fought contest stretching over thousands of cities and towns  across the United States, Tempe emerged triumphant in a far-reaching, citywide  bid to nab the gala event. Mayor Hugh Hallman himself rallied the community,  which stepped up with dozens of videos that were posted on YouTube.  Hypothesis: Hugh Jackman plays the role of Wolverine in the movie.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise. The premise states that the Tempe Hometown Premiere will feature Hugh Jackman, which directly implies that he will be attending the event as a guest or participant, and since he is mentioned alongside other actors in the film, it is reasonable to infer that he will be playing the role of Wolverine in the movie.	72	
1760487480	1760487481	Premise: In October, however, amid rising tensions between the government and opposition groups, a car bomb seriously injured an opposition politician and killed his driver, in Beirut.  Hypothesis: A member of the opposition was injured in a car bomb attack in Beirut.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that a car bomb seriously injured an opposition politician and killed his driver in Beirut in October. However, the hypothesis only mentions that a member of the opposition was injured in a car bomb attack in Beirut. The hypothesis does not specify that the injured person was a politician, which is an essential detail provided in the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis is too general and does not logically follow from the premise.	95	
1760487481	1760487482	Premise: Weinstock painstakingly reviewed dozens of studies for evidence of any link between sunscreen use and either an increase or decrease in melanoma.  Hypothesis: skin cancer numbers increase.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Weinstock ""painstakingly reviewed dozens of studies"" for evidence of a link between sunscreen use and skin cancer, which implies that the goal was to investigate and potentially find evidence of a relationship between the two. However, the hypothesis states that the hypothesis is that skin cancer numbers increase, which is the opposite of what Weinstock's review was trying to investigate.  A more likely hypothesis that follows from the premise would be that there is no significant evidence of a link between sunscreen use and an increase in melanoma (e.g. ""no conclusive evidence of a relationship between sunscreen use and melanoma"", or ""sunscreen use does not appear to increase melanoma rates"").  The original hypothesis is too specific and absolute, and does not align with the purpose of Weinstock's review, which was to investigate the potential link, not to make a definitive statement about the relationship."	195	
1760487482	1760487484	Premise: Most people are familiar with the idea of St. Bernards or other dogs taking part in rescue and recovery efforts. Robots might also take part in search and rescue missions.  Hypothesis: Robots are used to find missing victims.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that most people are familiar with St. Bernards or other dogs taking part in rescue and recovery efforts. This implies that dogs have traditionally been involved in search and rescue missions, but it does not necessarily suggest that robots are used for this purpose.  The hypothesis states that robots are used to find missing victims, which is a specific and new application of robots in search and rescue efforts. The premise does not provide any information about robots being used for this specific purpose, so we cannot logically conclude that robots are used to find missing victims based on the premise alone.  The hypothesis requires additional information or context to be supported, such as a statement that robots have been integrated into search and rescue operations or that there is a notable example of a robot being used for this purpose.	170	
1760487484	1760487484	Premise: Illinois born Charlton Heston was a 27-year-old actor from Broadway and television when he arrived in Hollywood for a five-picture contract with Hal Wallis.  Hypothesis: Charlton Heston was born in Illinois.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Charlton Heston was a 27-year-old actor from Broadway and television when he arrived in Hollywood for a five-picture contract with Hal Wallis. It does not mention his birthplace, Illinois.  Therefore, we cannot conclude that Charlton Heston was born in Illinois based on the premise. The information about his age, profession, and contract is not sufficient to determine his birthplace.	98	
1760487484	1760487486	Premise: Ruth's 1927 single season record of 60 home runs stood unsurpassed until Roger Maris hit 61 in 1961.  Hypothesis: Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs in his lifetime.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Ruth's 1927 single-season record of 60 home runs stood unsurpassed until Roger Maris hit 61 in 1961. This implies that there is a record of a single season of 60 home runs, which is the benchmark for the single season record. The premise does not provide any information about Ruth's lifetime home run total.  The hypothesis states that Ruth hit 60 home runs in his lifetime. However, the premise does not provide any information about Ruth's lifetime home run total, so it is not possible to conclude that he hit 60 home runs in his lifetime based on the premise. In fact, the premise only tells us that Ruth's 1927 record stood unsurpassed for a certain number of years, which is not necessarily his total lifetime home run total.	177	
1760487486	1760487487	Premise: The German technology was employed to build Shanghai's existing maglev line, the first in the world to be used commercially.  Hypothesis: Maglev is commercially used.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the German technology was employed to build Shanghai's existing maglev line, but it does not provide any information about the commercial use of the line. The premise only mentions the technology used to build the line, not its current or intended use.  To support the hypothesis that maglev is commercially used, additional information would be needed, such as the fact that the line is in operation, carries passengers or freight, and is used for commercial purposes. The premise only provides a basis for the construction of the line, but does not provide any information about its current or intended use.	132	
1760487487	1760487488	"Premise: SEATTLE — United Nations gang leader Clay Roueche should spend at least 30 years behind bars after his surprise guilty plea here Tuesday for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine, marijuana and illicit drug profits, U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Sullivan said. Sullivan said outside court that Roueche's leadership of the violent UN gang and the sophistication of the international drug conspiracy will all be factors used to argue for a longer sentence — up to life — for the 33-year-old Canadian. And he stressed that the plea agreement reached with Roueche did not include ""any kind of break with respect to sentencing."".  Hypothesis: Clay Roueche is 33 years old.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Clay Roueche is a 33-year-old Canadian who is guilty of conspiracy to smuggle cocaine, marijuana, and illicit drug profits. However, it does not provide any information that would directly link his age to the severity of the crime or the proposed sentence. In fact, the premise only mentions that the plea agreement does not include any ""kind of break with respect to sentencing,"" but it does not imply that Roueche's age will be a factor in determining the sentence.  The information about Roueche's age is presented as a separate piece of background information, and it is not necessary to infer that it is relevant to the sentencing decision. Therefore, the hypothesis that Clay Roueche is 33 years old does not logically follow from the premise."	171	
1760487488	1760487490	"Premise: Baker's voice will replace the earlier computer-synthesized voice that was previously used. BT said that his voice was chosen as it was instantly recognisable. It took him 11 days to record 11,593 phrases and sounds which could then be broken down and reassembled by a computer to make new words. It then took five months to process these recordings to make a workable service. BT have said that there will be no barriers as to what Tom Baker's voice can 'say', including rude words. ""What appeals to me most is the thought that I will be bringing good news to people whether it is a cheeky message, a birthday greeting, or just a quick hello,"" said Baker.  Hypothesis: Tom Baker works for BT.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Baker's voice was chosen because it is ""instantly recognisable"", and that it took 11 days to record 11,593 phrases and sounds, which were then processed by a computer to create a workable service. This suggests that Baker is involved in creating a voice-based service, possibly a voice-over service or a text-to-speech system.  The hypothesis that Tom Baker works for BT is supported by the mention of ""BT"", which is a well-known telecommunications company. The text also states that Baker's voice is being used for a service that will be provided by BT, which suggests that he is an employee or partner of the company.  Additionally, the tone and language used in the quote from Baker, such as his enthusiasm for bringing good news to people, is consistent with the kind of public persona one might expect from a celebrity spokesperson for a company like BT.  Overall, the premise provides sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that Tom Baker works for BT."	211	
1760487490	1760487491	Premise: The Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for the selection of the candidates and the choice of Prize Winners for the Peace Prize. The Committee is composed of five members appointed by the Storting (Norwegian parliament). The Peace Prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway and not in Stockholm, Sweden like the other Nobel Prizes.  Hypothesis: Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for the selection of candidates and the choice of Prize Winners for the Peace Prize, and that the Committee is composed of five members appointed by the Storting (Norwegian parliament). However, it does not state that the Committee has chosen any candidates or winners. In fact, it only describes the structure and function of the Committee.  Therefore, the hypothesis that Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen is not supported by the premise, as it is not mentioned or implied. The premise only provides information about the Committee's role and composition, but does not provide any information about the actual process of selecting candidates or winners.	145	
1760487491	1760487492	Premise: More than 150 dolphins, marine turtles and beaked whales have been washed up dead on beaches in Africa.  Hypothesis: Dead dolphins, turtles and whales have been found on African beaches.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that more than 150 dolphins, marine turtles, and beaked whales have been washed up dead on beaches in Africa. This information provides sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that dead dolphins, turtles, and whales have indeed been found on African beaches.  The premise is a statement of fact, and the hypothesis is a logical conclusion that can be drawn from that fact. The hypothesis is a concise and specific statement that directly addresses the situation described in the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis is a reasonable and logical inference from the premise.	119
