1760486166	1760486167	Premise: No Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq Yet.  Hypothesis: Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that no weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) have been found in Iraq. This information suggests that there is currently no evidence to support the existence of WMDs in Iraq.  On the other hand, the hypothesis states that WMDs have been found in Iraq. This conclusion directly contradicts the information provided in the premise.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. In fact, the premise provides evidence against the hypothesis, making it unlikely that the hypothesis is true.
1760486167	1760486168	Premise: A place of sorrow, after Pope John Paul II died, became a place of celebration, as Roman Catholic faithful gathered in downtown Chicago to mark the installation of new Pope Benedict XVI.  Hypothesis: Pope Benedict XVI is the new leader of the Roman Catholic Church.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that a place of sorrow (where Pope John Paul II died) became a place of celebration after his death, and a gathering of Roman Catholic faithful took place to mark the installation of a new Pope. However, this does not imply that Pope Benedict XVI is the new Pope.  The premise does not provide any information about the new Pope, and it is possible that another Pope was installed. The text only mentions the installation of a new Pope, but it does not specify which Pope. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Pope Benedict XVI is the new Pope based on the given information.
1760486168	1760486170	Premise: Herceptin was already approved to treat the sickest breast cancer patients, and the company said, Monday, it will discuss with federal regulators the possibility of prescribing the drug for more breast cancer patients.  Hypothesis: Herceptin can be used to treat breast cancer.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Herceptin was already approved to treat the sickest breast cancer patients, which implies that it is already approved for a specific group of patients (those with the sickest forms of breast cancer). However, the hypothesis states that Herceptin can be used to treat all breast cancer patients, not just the sickest ones.  The premise only provides information about the existing approval for the sickest patients, but does not provide any information about the effectiveness or safety of Herceptin for other types of breast cancer patients. Therefore, the hypothesis is not supported by the premise, and it is not necessarily true that Herceptin can be used to treat all breast cancer patients.
1760486170	1760486171	Premise: Judie Vivian, chief executive at ProMedica, a medical service company that helps sustain the 2-year-old Vietnam Heart Institute in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), said that so far about 1,500 children have received treatment.  Hypothesis: The previous name of Ho Chi Minh City was Saigon.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that ProMedica is a medical service company that helps sustain the 2-year-old Vietnam Heart Institute in Ho Chi Minh City. There is no information in the premise that the previous name of Ho Chi Minh City was Saigon. The premise only mentions the current name of the city, "Ho Chi Minh City", and its age, which is 2 years. The hypothesis, on the other hand, makes a claim about the city's past name, which is not supported by the given information.   Therefore, the hypothesis is not a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the premise.
1760486171	1760486172	Premise: A man is due in court later charged with the murder 26 years ago of a teenager whose case was the first to be featured on BBC One's Crimewatch. Colette Aram, 16, was walking to her boyfriend's house in Keyworth, Nottinghamshire, on 30 October 1983 when she disappeared. Her body was later found in a field close to her home. Paul Stewart Hutchinson, 50, has been charged with murder and is due before Nottingham magistrates later.  Hypothesis: Paul Stewart Hutchinson is accused of having stabbed a girl.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Colette Aram, 16, was found dead in a field close to her home, and Paul Stewart Hutchinson has been charged with murder. This implies that the manner of death is unknown, and the hypothesis suggests a specific method of murder (stabbing). However, the premise does not provide any information about the method of death, only that Colette's body was found in a field.  The hypothesis should be revised to be more specific to what is actually stated in the premise, such as: "Paul Stewart Hutchinson is accused of being involved in Colette Aram's death."
1760486172	1760486173	Premise: Britain said, Friday, that it has barred cleric, Omar Bakri, from returning to the country from Lebanon, where he was released by police after being detained for 24 hours.  Hypothesis: Bakri was briefly detained, but was released.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Britain has barred Omar Bakri from returning to the country from Lebanon, which implies that he was not allowed to enter the country in the first place. However, the hypothesis states that Bakri was briefly detained, but was released, which is not necessarily related to the fact that he was barred from returning.  The premise provides information about the outcome of Bakri's detention, while the hypothesis provides additional information about the nature of the detention. These are two separate pieces of information, and the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.
1760486173	1760486174	Premise: Nearly 4 million children who have at least one parent who entered the U.S. illegally were born in the United States and are U.S. citizens as a result, according to the study conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center. That's about three quarters of the estimated 5.5 million children of illegal immigrants inside the United States, according to the study. About 1.8 million children of undocumented immigrants live in poverty, the study found.  Hypothesis: Three quarters of U.S. illegal immigrants have children.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that nearly 4 million children have at least one parent who entered the U.S. illegally and are U.S. citizens, and that this is about three-quarters of the estimated 5.5 million children of undocumented immigrants. This suggests that the number of children of undocumented immigrants is approximately 5.5 million, but it does not provide any information about the total number of undocumented immigrants.  The hypothesis, "Three quarters of U.S. illegal immigrants have children," implies that the 4 million children of undocumented immigrants are a subset of all undocumented immigrants, but the premise does not provide any information about the total number of undocumented immigrants. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis follows from the premise.
1760486174	1760486175	Premise: Like the United States, U.N. officials are also dismayed that Aristide killed a conference called by Prime Minister Robert Malval in Port-au-Prince in hopes of bringing all the feuding parties together.  Hypothesis: Aristide had Prime Minister Robert Malval  murdered in Port-au-Prince.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that U.N. officials are dismayed that Aristide killed a conference called by Prime Minister Robert Malval in Port-au-Prince. However, the hypothesis suggests that Aristide killed Prime Minister Robert Malval.  The premise does not provide any information that links Aristide to the murder of Prime Minister Malval. In fact, it states that Aristide is dismayed by the conference being killed, implying that someone else might have been responsible for the conference's demise. Therefore, we cannot infer that Aristide was involved in the murder.  The premise sets up a situation where a conference is being disrupted or terminated, but it does not provide any evidence to suggest that Aristide was responsible for the termination. The hypothesis is not supported by the premise and is an unwarranted leap.
1760486175	1760486176	Premise: WASHINGTON --  A newly declassified narrative of the Bush administration's advice to the CIA on harsh interrogations shows that the small group of Justice Department lawyers who wrote memos authorizing controversial interrogation techniques were operating not on their own but with direction from top administration officials, including then-Vice President Dick Cheney and national security adviser Condoleezza Rice. At the same time, the narrative suggests that then-Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and then-Secretary of State Colin Powell were largely left out of the decision-making process.  Hypothesis: Dick Cheney was the Vice President of Bush.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise. The premise states that the small group of Justice Department lawyers who wrote memos authorizing controversial interrogation techniques were operating "not on their own but with direction from top administration officials, including then-Vice President Dick Cheney and national security adviser Condoleezza Rice."  The hypothesis states that Dick Cheney was the Vice President of Bush. Since the premise specifically mentions that Cheney was one of the top administration officials directing the Justice Department lawyers, it logically follows that Cheney was indeed the Vice President of Bush.
1760486176	1760486177	Premise: Only a week after it had no comment on upping the storage capacity of its Hotmail e-mail service, Microsoft early Thursday announced it was boosting the allowance to 250MB to follow similar moves by rivals such as Google, Yahoo, and Lycos.  Hypothesis: Microsoft's Hotmail has raised its storage capacity to 250MB.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise states that Microsoft had no comment on upping the storage capacity of its Hotmail e-mail service just a week prior to the announcement. However, the announcement of a 250MB increase in storage capacity directly addresses the lack of comment, implying that the company was indeed considering or planning to make such an update. The fact that it took action shortly after the initial silence suggests that the company had been thinking about increasing the storage capacity and was simply waiting for the right moment to make the announcement.
1760486177	1760486178	Premise: Lina Joy, 42, was born Azlina Jailani to Malay parents, and was raised as a Muslim. Malaysia's constitution guarantees freedom of religion, but by law, all ethnic Malays are Muslim. Joy converted to Christianity at age 26, and after some bureaucratic difficulties had her named legally changed in 1999. However, on her MyKad national ID, the National Registration Department retained her stated religion as Islam. In order to have her religion changed, the National Registration Department said Joy would have to obtain a certificate of apostasy from the Muslim Sharia Court.  Hypothesis: Lina Joy's parents are from Malaysia.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Lina Joy was born Azlina Jailani to Malay parents and was raised as a Muslim, but it does not provide any information about her parents' nationality or country of origin. The hypothesis, on the other hand, specifically states that Lina Joy's parents are from Malaysia.  The premise only mentions that Lina Joy was born in Malaysia and was raised as a Muslim, but it does not provide any information about her parents' nationality or ethnicity. Therefore, the hypothesis makes an assumption that is not supported by the premise.
1760486178	1760486179	Premise: November 9, 1989 , the day the Berlin Wall fell and the world changed forever . Not even the most astute saw it coming . As Hungary's foreign minister in the late summer of 1989 , Gyula Horn gave the order to let visiting East Germans use his country to do a 400-mile end run around the Berlin Wall , a move now seen as the beginning of the end for hard-line communism in Europe .  Hypothesis: The Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Gyula Horn, Hungary's foreign minister, gave the order to let visiting East Germans use Hungary to do a 400-mile end run around the Berlin Wall. This event occurred in the late summer of 1989, but the premise does not state that the Berlin Wall was torn down.  In fact, the Berlin Wall was not torn down until November 9, 1989, which is mentioned in the premise. The hypothesis is making a specific claim about the timing and event, whereas the premise provides a different time frame and context. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.
1760486179	1760486180	Premise: Valero Energy Corp., on Monday, said it found "extensive" additional damage at its 250,000-barrel-per-day Port Arthur refinery.  Hypothesis: Valero Energy Corp. produces 250,000 barrels per day.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Valero Energy Corp. found "extensive" additional damage at its 250,000-barrel-per-day Port Arthur refinery. However, the hypothesis states that Valero Energy Corp. produces 250,000 barrels per day, which is a specific production rate, whereas the premise does not provide any information about the production rate.  The premise only mentions the damage at the refinery, not the production rate. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.
1760486180	1760486181	Premise: Oil prices fall back as Yukos oil threat lifted  Hypothesis: Oil prices rise.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that "Oil prices fall back as Yukos oil threat lifted", which suggests that the lifting of the Yukos oil threat has led to a decrease in oil prices. This implies that the threat was previously causing oil prices to rise.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that "Oil prices rise", which is the opposite of the implication of the premise. If the premise suggests that oil prices fell due to the lifting of the threat, it is unlikely that oil prices would rise.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.
1760486181	1760486182	Premise: Brian Brohm, the Louisville quarterback, threw for 368 yards and five touchdowns as the Cardinals beat visiting Oregon State 63-27.  Hypothesis: The quarterback threw for 413 yards and three touchdowns, and then ran to the end zone two more times.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Brian Brohm threw for 368 yards and five touchdowns. The hypothesis states that he threw for 413 yards and three touchdowns, and then ran to the end zone two more times. However, the premise does not mention that Brohm ran to the end zone at all, let alone two more times.  Therefore, the hypothesis introduces information that is not supported by the premise, and the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.
1760486182	1760486183	Premise: Greg Page, a former heavyweight boxing champion who suffered a severe brain injury in a 2001 fight, has died at 50. His wife Patricia said the one-time WBA champion had died at his home in Kentucky, USA, of complications related to injuries he suffered in the fight. Page was in a coma for a week after the 9 March 2001 fight against Dale Crowe which was stopped in the 10th round. Patricia Page said he was "in a better place now" after announcing on Monday he had died overnight in his sleep.  Hypothesis: Greg Page was a WBA champion.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Greg Page suffered a severe brain injury in a 2001 fight and died at 50, while the hypothesis states that he was a WBA champion. The premise does not mention the World Boxing Association (WBA) or any other boxing organization, nor does it provide any information about Greg Page's boxing titles. The information about the WBA champion is not supported by the premise, and it is not logically necessary to infer that Greg Page was a WBA champion from the information provided.
1760486183	1760486184	Premise: Sierra is likely to remain in jail at the Hillsborough County jail in her native Tampa until her next hearing on December 20, where she is being held without bail, which would prevent her attending the Washington event on Friday even if she still had permission to perform. Sierra has been in jail since the start of the month after an altercation with police officers outside a Tampa nightclub, which she had been ejected from. She is charged with disorderly intoxication and resisting arrest.  Hypothesis: Sierra once reached the finals of "American Idol".  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise provides information about Sierra's current situation: she is being held in jail, charged with disorderly intoxication and resisting arrest, and has a hearing on December 20. It does not provide any information about Sierra's past, such as her involvement in "American Idol".  The hypothesis is about Sierra's past experience on "American Idol", which is not mentioned in the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis is not supported by the given information.
1760486184	1760486185	Premise: Since 1987, however, Brazil has taken steps to dramatically reduce the destruction, including stepped-up enforcement and the elimination of tax incentives that led to large-scale land clearing.  Hypothesis: In the early 1990s Brazil began to take action to save the rainforest.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Brazil has taken steps to dramatically reduce the destruction of the rainforest since 1987, including stepped-up enforcement and the elimination of tax incentives that led to large-scale land clearing. This implies that Brazil has been taking proactive measures to mitigate the destruction of the rainforest.  However, the hypothesis states that Brazil began to take action in the early 1990s, which is a specific time frame that is not mentioned in the premise. The premise does not provide any information about when Brazil began taking action, only that it has been doing so since 1987. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.
1760486185	1760486186	Premise: FIFA has received 11 bids to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments, an international football competition contested by the men's national teams. The countries vying to host the tournament are Australia, England, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Qatar, Russia, South Korea and United States, who have individual bids and the joint bids are from Belgium-Netherlands and Spain-Portugal.  Select bids are for 2018 and 2022 tournaments and two bids are just for the 2022 tournament. Qatar and South Korea are vying just for the 2022 tournament. The two winning bids will be chosen on December 2010 by the 24-man executive committee of FIFA.  Said FIFA president Sepp Blatter: "We are very pleased about the fantastic level of interest in our flagship competition, with all initial bidders confirming their candidature."  Hypothesis: Sepp Blatter is the president of FIFA.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that "FIFA has received 11 bids to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments" and "Said FIFA president Sepp Blatter: 'We are very pleased about the fantastic level of interest in our flagship competition, with all initial bidders confirming their candidature.'".   The mention of Sepp Blatter, specifically his quote, directly attributes the statement to him, implying that he is the president of FIFA. This establishes a clear connection between Sepp Blatter and the statement, making it reasonable to conclude that he is the president of FIFA.
1760486186	1760486188	Premise: U.S. crude settled $1.32 lower at $42.83 a barrel.  Hypothesis: Crude the light American lowered to the closing 1.32 dollars, to 42.83 dollars the barrel.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis "Crude the light American lowered to the closing 1.32 dollars, to 42.83 dollars the barrel" does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that U.S. crude "settled $1.32 lower" at $42.83 a barrel, which means that the price of crude decreased by $1.32 from its previous value. The hypothesis, however, states that the price of crude "lowered to the closing 1.32 dollars", which is a different interpretation of the same information.  The correct interpretation of the premise is that the price of crude decreased by $1.32, not that the price "lowered to" $1.32. The word "lowered" is not a verb in this context, but rather a noun, referring to the amount of the decrease.  To rephrase the hypothesis in a way that follows from the premise, it could be: "The price of crude decreased by $1.32 to $42.83 a barrel."
1760486188	1760486189	Premise: WINNENDEN, Germany ―A teenage gunman killed 15 people, most of them female, on Wednesday in a rampage that began at a school near Stuttgart in southern Germany and ended in a nearby town, where he then killed himself after the police wounded him. The attack left Germany, which tightened tough gun controls after a similar attack at a school seven years ago, struggling to understand the carnage that had again befallen it, a country with relatively little violent crime. In 2002, a gunman killed 16 people before killing himself at a school in Erfurt, in eastern Germany.  Hypothesis: In 2002 near Stuttgart a boy shot 16 people.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that in 2002, a gunman killed 16 people before killing himself at a school in Erfurt, which is located in eastern Germany. However, the hypothesis states that the gunman shot 16 people near Stuttgart, which is a different location (near Stuttgart is in southern Germany, not eastern Germany). The premise provides specific details about the location of the 2002 incident (Erfurt), but the hypothesis incorrectly changes the location to near Stuttgart. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.
1760486189	1760486190	Premise: Many hopes are riding on the sale of Talisman's holdings in Palm Beach and Hendry counties, which Vice President Al Gore announced with much fanfare last year at the 50th anniversary of Everglades National Park.  Hypothesis: Everglades National Park is located in Florida.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise. Here's why:  The premise states that many hopes are riding on the sale of Talisman's holdings in Palm Beach and Hendry counties. This implies that these counties are significant locations, possibly due to their value or importance.  The hypothesis states that Everglades National Park is located in these counties. Given that Palm Beach and Hendry counties are mentioned specifically, it is reasonable to infer that Everglades National Park is indeed located in these counties, as they are adjacent to the park.  The connection between the premise and hypothesis is that the sale of Talisman's holdings in Palm Beach and Hendry counties is significant because of the location of Everglades National Park, which is a major concern or stakeholder in these counties. Therefore, the hypothesis follows logically from the premise.
1760486190	1760486191	Premise: Rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy and ultimately death. Early symptoms of rabies in humans are nonspecific, consisting of fever, headache, and general malaise.  Hypothesis: Rabies is fatal in humans.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy and ultimately death. However, it does not explicitly state that the virus is fatal in humans. The phrase "ultimately death" implies that death is a possible outcome, but it does not guarantee that death is the only outcome.  Furthermore, the premise mentions that early symptoms of rabies in humans are nonspecific, consisting of fever, headache, and general malaise. This suggests that the virus may not always progress to the fatal stage, as some people may recover from the infection.  Therefore, the hypothesis "Rabies is fatal in humans" is not necessarily implied by the premise. The premise only provides information about the progression of the disease and its effects on the central nervous system, but it does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that death is the only outcome.
1760486191	1760486193	Premise: American tobacco companies were showing a profit most quarters due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products sold including food.  Hypothesis: PM often entered markets with both cigarettes and food.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise states that American tobacco companies were showing a profit most quarters due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products sold including food. This implies that the companies were finding success in both the cigarette market and the food market.   Given that the companies were already finding success in both markets, it is reasonable to hypothesize that PM (presumably Philip Morris, one of the American tobacco companies) would also enter markets with both cigarettes and food, as it would be a logical extension of their existing business strategy.   This is an example of a deductive reasoning process, where we use specific information to make a general conclusion. We start with a premise (American tobacco companies were successful in both cigarette and food markets) and use that premise to make a hypothesis about PM's business strategy (entering markets with both cigarettes and food).
1760486193	1760486194	Premise: The development of agriculture by early humans, roughly 10,000 years ago, was also harmful to many natural ecosystems as they were systematically destroyed and replaced with artificial versions.  Hypothesis: Humans existed 10,000 years ago.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the development of agriculture by early humans was harmful to many natural ecosystems, and that this happened roughly 10,000 years ago. This implies that humans existed before the development of agriculture.  The hypothesis, however, states that humans existed 10,000 years ago, which is the exact time period mentioned in the premise. However, the premise does not provide any direct evidence that humans existed at this time, only that agriculture developed at this time.  To establish the hypothesis as true, we would need additional evidence, such as fossil records, genetic data, or other archaeological findings that confirm human presence 10,000 years ago. The premise only provides information about the impact of agriculture on ecosystems, not about the existence of humans at that time.
1760486194	1760486195	Premise: The two young leaders of the coup, Pibul Songgram and Pridi Phanomyang, both educated in Europe and influenced by Western ideas, came to dominate Thai politics in the ensuing years.  Hypothesis: Pibul was a young leader.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Pibul Songgram and Pridi Phanomyang are the two young leaders of the coup, but it does not provide any information about Pibul's age. The hypothesis, on the other hand, specifies that Pibul is a young leader. Since the premise does not provide any information about Pibul's age, we cannot infer that he is young based on the premise.
1760486195	1760486196	Premise: Lin Piao, after all, was the creator of Mao's "Little Red Book" of quotations.  Hypothesis: Lin Piao wrote the "Little Red Book".  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Lin Piao was the creator of Mao's "Little Red Book" of quotations. However, the hypothesis states that Lin Piao wrote the "Little Red Book". While it is true that Lin Piao was involved with the "Little Red Book", there is no evidence to suggest that he was its sole creator or author.  The "Little Red Book" was actually a compilation of Mao Zedong's quotes, compiled and edited by Mao himself, with some input from other individuals, including Zhou Enlai and other high-ranking Communist Party officials. Therefore, the hypothesis is not supported by the premise, as the premise does not provide any information about Lin Piao's role in writing or compiling the book.
1760486196	1760486198	Premise: When patients interrupt a course of antibiotics, the surviving bacteria return with a vengeance, often having rapidly mutated to resist the therapy.  Hypothesis: Bacteria is winning the war against antibiotics.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that when patients interrupt a course of antibiotics, the surviving bacteria return with a vengeance, often having rapidly mutated to resist the therapy. This suggests that the antibiotics are effective in reducing the bacterial population, but not eliminating it.  The hypothesis, however, claims that the bacteria are winning the war against antibiotics. This implies that the bacteria are not only surviving but thriving and overcoming the antibiotics, which contradicts the premise.  To follow from the premise, the hypothesis should state something like: "When patients interrupt a course of antibiotics, the surviving bacteria rapidly mutate and adapt to overcome the therapy, making it less effective and potentially leading to increased bacterial resistance."  In other words, the premise suggests that antibiotics are effective in reducing the bacterial population, but the hypothesis should acknowledge the limitations of the antibiotics and the potential for bacterial adaptation and resistance.
1760486198	1760486199	Premise: Initially the Bundesbank opposed the introduction of the euro but was compelled to accept it in light of the political pressure of the capitalist politicians who supported its introduction.  Hypothesis: The introduction of the euro has been opposed.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Bundesbank opposed the introduction of the euro, but it also states that this opposition was "compelled" by political pressure from capitalist politicians who supported its introduction. This implies that the Bundesbank's opposition was not absolute, but rather a temporary or conditional opposition. In other words, the Bundesbank may have ultimately supported the introduction of the euro, even if it initially opposed it.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the introduction of the euro was opposed. This is a stronger claim that is not necessarily supported by the premise. The premise only suggests that the Bundesbank opposed the introduction of the euro, but it does not rule out the possibility that this opposition was later overcome.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.
1760486199	1760486200	Premise: The Armed Forces Press Committee (COPREFA) admitted that the government troops sustained 11 casualties in these clashes, adding that they inflicted three casualties on the rebels.  Hypothesis: Three rebels were killed by government troops.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the government troops sustained 11 casualties in the clashes, but it does not provide any information about the rebels. It only mentions that the government troops inflicted three casualties on the rebels. This information is actually the opposite of the hypothesis, which claims that three rebels were killed by government troops.  The premise and hypothesis are mutually exclusive, and there is no logical connection between the two. The premise only reports the government's losses, while the hypothesis makes an unsubstantiated claim about the rebels' losses.
1760486200	1760486201	Premise: One economic study will not be the basis of Canada's public policy decisions, but Easton's research does conclusively show that there are economic benefits in the legalization of marijuana.  Hypothesis: Drug legalization has benefits.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that one economic study will not be the basis of Canada's public policy decisions, but it does not state that Easton's research is the study that will not be the basis of policy decisions. The premise only mentions that one study will not be used, but it does not specify which study.  The hypothesis states that drug legalization has benefits, but the premise only mentions the study's potential to inform policy decisions, not the content of the study itself. The premise does not provide any information about the results of Easton's research, only that it will not be the basis of policy decisions.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.
1760486201	1760486202	Premise: Archaeologists have found approximately 30 beautifully preserved mummies in a 4,000 year old Egyptian necropolis which held 53 tombs. Supervisor of Antiquities for Middle Egypt Dr. Abdel-Rahman El-Ayedi's team established his archaeological site in the Faiyum Oasis near the El-Lahun Egyptian pyramid which is just south of Cairo. Besides the mummies, the team found masks, amulets, clay pots and an offering table located in a funerary chapel. The chapel dates back to about 30 BC to 337 AD.  Hypothesis: 30 beautifully preserved mummies have been located in the south of Cairo.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that archaeologists have found approximately 30 beautifully preserved mummies in a 4,000 year old Egyptian necropolis with 53 tombs in the Faiyum Oasis near the El-Lahun Egyptian pyramid, which is just south of Cairo. However, the hypothesis claims that the mummies are located in the south of Cairo, but the premise does not specify that the necropolis and the mummies are located in the south of Cairo. It only states that the El-Lahun Egyptian pyramid is located just south of Cairo, but it does not imply that the necropolis is also in the south of Cairo.  Therefore, the hypothesis makes an assumption that is not supported by the premise.
1760486202	1760486203	Premise: Gastrointestinal bleeding can happen as an adverse effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin or ibuprofen.  Hypothesis: Aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that gastrointestinal bleeding can happen as an adverse effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen. This implies that NSAIDs can cause gastrointestinal bleeding.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding. This is the opposite of what the premise suggests.  To follow from the premise, the hypothesis would need to be rephrased to something like: "Aspirin reduces the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding." This revised hypothesis would be a more logical conclusion based on the premise.
1760486203	1760486204	Premise: A former employee of the company, David Vance of South Portland, said Hooper spent a lot of time on the road, often meeting with customers between Portland and Kittery.  Hypothesis: Hooper is a citizen of Portland.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that David Vance of South Portland said Hooper spent a lot of time on the road, often meeting with customers between Portland and Kittery. However, it does not provide any information about Hooper's citizenship. The fact that Hooper is from South Portland (a suburb of Portland) does not necessarily imply that Hooper is a citizen of Portland. South Portland is a separate city from Portland, and someone from South Portland can still be a citizen of Maine, but not necessarily of the city of Portland.  Therefore, the hypothesis that Hooper is a citizen of Portland does not logically follow from the premise.
1760486204	1760486206	Premise: Cyprus, divided or not, joins the EU on the 1st of May.  Hypothesis: Cyprus was divided into two parts on May 1.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Cyprus joins the EU on May 1, which is a factual event that can be true or false. The hypothesis, however, states that Cyprus was divided into two parts on May 1, which is a specific event that is not necessarily related to the act of joining the EU.   The premise only mentions the date of joining the EU, but it does not imply any specific event or action that would lead to the division of Cyprus. The division of Cyprus occurred in 1974, more than 40 years before the premise's date, and it was a result of a conflict between Greece and Turkey.   Therefore, the hypothesis is not logically connected to the premise, and it is not a necessary consequence of the premise.
1760486206	1760486207	Premise: World leaders expressed concern on Thursday that North Korea will quit six-party nuclear disarmament talks and will  bolster its nuclear weapons arsenal.  Hypothesis: North Korea says it has a stockpile of nuclear weapons and is building more.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that world leaders are concerned that North Korea will quit six-party nuclear disarmament talks and bolster its nuclear weapons arsenal. This implies that there is a concern about North Korea's intentions and actions regarding nuclear disarmament.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that North Korea has a stockpile of nuclear weapons and is building more. While this is a possible interpretation of North Korea's intentions, it is not necessarily implied by the premise. The premise does not provide any information about North Korea's current nuclear capabilities or intentions, only that world leaders are concerned about the possibility of it quitting disarmament talks and bolstering its arsenal.  Therefore, the hypothesis is not a logical consequence of the premise, and additional information is needed to support the connection between the two statements.
1760486207	1760486208	Premise: In addition to establishing the electoral commission, the laws also concern nationality, a contentious issue since citizenship laws were tightened to exclude one of Gbagbo's main competitors from the 2000 presidential race, former prime minister Alassane Ouattara.  Hypothesis: Gbagbo is a competitor of Ouattara.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the laws concern nationality and that citizenship laws were tightened to exclude one of Gbagbo's main competitors from the 2000 presidential race. However, it does not explicitly state that Gbagbo is a competitor of Ouattara. The premise only mentions that Ouattara was excluded from the presidential race, but it does not provide any information about Gbagbo's relationship with Ouattara.  To support the hypothesis, additional information would be needed, such as a statement that Gbagbo and Ouattara were both running for president in the 2000 election or that they had a notable disagreement. As it stands, the premise only provides information about the exclusion of Ouattara from the election, but does not establish a direct connection between Gbagbo and Ouattara as competitors.
1760486208	1760486210	Premise: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace Prize, though he was nominated for it five times between 1937 and 1948.  Hypothesis: Mohandas received the Nobel Prize in 1989.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize five times between 1937 and 1948, but it does not say that he was not awarded the prize. The premise does not provide any information about whether Gandhi actually received the prize or not.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that Gandhi received the Nobel Prize in 1989, which is outside the timeframe mentioned in the premise (1937-1948). This is a new and unrelated claim that is not supported by the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.
1760486210	1760486211	Premise: The Christian Democrats (CDU) won 35.2% of the vote, or 225 seats, against 34.3% for Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats (SPD).  Hypothesis: It seems unlikely that there will be a coalition between Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats and Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Christian Democrats (CDU) won 35.2% of the vote and 225 seats, while the Social Democrats (SPD) won 34.3% of the vote and 225 seats. This implies that the CDU and SPD are tied for the most seats.  The hypothesis states that it is unlikely that there will be a coalition between the Social Democrats and Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union. However, given that they are tied for the most seats, it is actually more likely that there will be a coalition between the CDU and SPD, rather than between the SPD and Angela Merkel's faction of the CDU.
1760486211	1760486212	Premise: Edward VIII became King in January of 1936 and abdicated in December.  Hypothesis: King Edward VIII abdicated in December 1936.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Edward VIII became King in January of 1936 and abdicated in December. However, the hypothesis states that Edward VIII abdicated in December 1936, but it does not specify that he became King in January 1936. The premise only mentions the month of January as the time when Edward VIII became King, not the specific year. Therefore, the hypothesis is not necessarily supported by the premise.
1760486212	1760486213	Premise: Australian Guantanamo Bay detainee David Hicks has won British citizenship, opening the door for a possible bid to have him freed from the US detention facility in Cuba. Justice Lawrence Collins of the British High Court has overturned the British Government's refusal of citizenship to Hicks, whose mother was born in England. Justice Collins said the Government had "no power to withhold or deprive citizenship". Justice Collins said: "In my view it would be improper to fail to give assistance which otherwise would have been given, simply because the claimant was believed to be involved in terrorism and has not had any previous connection with this country." Hicks' lawyer, Stephen Grosz, said the decision was a breakthrough. He said there was now no reason why Hicks should not enjoy the same protection as the nine other British citizens released without charge from Guantanamo Bay on representations of the British Government.  Hypothesis: Stephen Grosz is the British lawyer of David Hicks.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that David Hicks has won British citizenship, but it does not explicitly state that Stephen Grosz is his lawyer. The only information provided is that Justice Collins, the British High Court judge, is the one who overturned the British Government's refusal of citizenship to Hicks, and that Stephen Grosz is Hicks' lawyer, but not that Grosz is the one who won the citizenship for Hicks.  The correct sequence of events would be: Hicks wins British citizenship, and then Grosz is his lawyer. The premise does not provide any direct connection between Grosz and the citizenship decision.
1760486213	1760486213	Premise: Rockweed has been harvested commercially in Nova Scotia since the late 1950's and is currently the most important commercial seaweed in Atlantic Canada.  Hypothesis: Marine vegetation is  harvested.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise states that Rockweed has been harvested commercially in Nova Scotia since the late 1950s and is currently the most important commercial seaweed in Atlantic Canada. This suggests that Rockweed is a valuable and commercially significant seaweed species in the region.  The hypothesis states that marine vegetation is harvested. Given that Rockweed is a type of marine vegetation (a seaweed) and it has been harvested commercially, it is reasonable to conclude that the harvesting of marine vegetation is indeed taking place.
1760486213	1760486214	Premise: Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has ordered security forces to take firm action against rioters following the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto. The violence has left at least 44 people dead and dozens injured. Mr. Musharraf insisted the measures were to protect people. VOA's Ayaz Gul reports from Islamabad that a bitter dispute has also erupted over how the 54-year-old politician died and who was behind her assassination.  Hypothesis: Musharraf has ordered rioters to take firm action against security forces.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that President Pervez Musharraf has ordered security forces to take firm action against rioters, but it does not mention anything about the rioters taking action against security forces. The hypothesis, on the other hand, implies that the rioters are taking action against the security forces, which is not supported by the premise.  To make the hypothesis follow from the premise, it would need to be rephrased to something like: "Musharraf has ordered security forces to take firm action against rioters." This revised hypothesis accurately reflects the information provided in the premise.
1760486214	1760486215	Premise: A month after Gov. David A. Paterson dropped his proposal for a soda tax, New York City's health commissioner has written an article advocating "hefty" taxes on sodas and sports drinks containing sugar. Such a tax, the article said, could be the biggest boon to public health since tobacco taxes. The commissioner, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, and Kelly D. Brownell of Yale University, his co-author, argue in the New England Journal of Medicine that a tax of a penny per ounce could reduce consumption by more than 10 percent and raise $1.2 billion a year in New York State alone.  Hypothesis: Michael Bloomberg is the mayor of New York.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Governor David A. Paterson dropped his proposal for a soda tax, and then mentions Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the health commissioner, writing an article advocating for a soda tax. There is no mention of Michael Bloomberg, who was the mayor of New York City from 2002 to 2013.   The hypothesis states that Michael Bloomberg is the mayor of New York, which is not supported by the information provided in the premise.
1760486215	1760486216	Premise: Officials said the Finnish suspect was among the dead but did not provide a motive for the attack.  Hypothesis: Officials said that the suspect, a Finnish citizen, was among the dead.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Finnish suspect was among the dead, but it does not explicitly state that the suspect is the one responsible for the attack. The phrase "among the dead" could refer to someone who was a victim of the attack, rather than the perpetrator.  The hypothesis assumes that the Finnish suspect is the perpetrator, but the premise does not provide any information that would lead to this conclusion. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.
1760486216	1760486217	Premise: Britain agreed to lift by March 31 a 150-mile military protection zone enforced around the islands since Argentina invaded them in 1982.  Hypothesis: The military protection zone around Falklands was lifted.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Britain agreed to lift a 150-mile military protection zone around the Falklands by March 31. However, it does not provide any information about the circumstances or the terms of lifting the protection zone, nor does it imply that the protection zone was a military protection zone around the Falklands.  The premise only mentions the Falklands, but it does not specify that the protection zone was around the Falklands. Therefore, it is possible that the protection zone was not around the Falklands, and the hypothesis about lifting the zone around the Falklands does not necessarily follow from the premise.
1760486217	1760486218	Premise: The ferry owner PT Nur Budi's spokesman blamed Indonesian port authorities for the tragedy. "The passenger capacity of the ferry is 205 people but the port administrator accepted more passengers as they thought it was possible," he said. The National Meteorological and Geophysics Agency, however, had published and raised an alert signal about high waves on Friday. It specifically stated that "Saturday 10th and Sunday 11th, Indonesian waters would have witnessed storm force waves," but despite the dire warnings KM Teratai set for the seas.  Hypothesis: An Indonesian ferry with 300 passengers sank.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the ferry had a passenger capacity of 205 people, but the port administrator accepted more passengers. It also mentions that the National Meteorological and Geophysics Agency had issued a warning about storm force waves on Saturday and Sunday, but the ferry set sail anyway. However, it does not provide any information about the number of passengers on the ferry.  The hypothesis assumes that the ferry sank and that there were 300 passengers on board, which is not supported by the premise. The premise does not mention the actual number of passengers on the ferry, only that its capacity was 205.
1760486218	1760486219	Premise: Tension and battles between Greek police and anarchist demonstrators took place in the centre of Athens, Greece, during the anti-war demonstration of the 4th European Social Forum which is taking place in the Greek capital, from 4 to 7 of May 2006. The march of the approximately 1,000 anarchists ended with clashes between groups of anarchists and police. Riot police used tear gas, while a branch of a Greek bank, a fast-food store and around 50 shop windows in central Athens were damaged.  Hypothesis: The riots in Greece started on December 6.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that the anti-war demonstration of the 4th European Social Forum took place in Athens from 4 to 7 May 2006, which implies that the events occurred in May 2006. The hypothesis, however, states that the riots started on December 6, which is outside the timeframe given in the premise (May 2006).
1760486219	1760486220	Premise: Libya's case against Britain and the US concerns the dispute over their demand for extradition of Libyans charged with blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in 1988.  Hypothesis: One case involved the extradition of Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Libya's case against Britain and the US concerns the dispute over their demand for extradition of Libyans charged with blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in 1988. This premise only mentions that Libya is involved in a dispute over extradition related to the Lockerbie bombing, but it does not specify that one of the cases involved the extradition of Libyan suspects.  The hypothesis, however, specifically mentions "One case involved the extradition of Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing." This hypothesis is too narrow and assumes a specific detail that is not mentioned in the premise. The premise only mentions a general dispute over extradition, while the hypothesis makes a specific claim about the nature of that dispute.
1760486220	1760486222	Premise: Argentina sought help from Britain on its privatization program and encouraged British investment.  Hypothesis: Argentina sought UK expertise on privatization and agriculture.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Argentina sought help from Britain on its privatization program and encouraged British investment. This implies that Argentina was looking for assistance in implementing its privatization program, which is a policy aimed at transferring ownership and control of state-owned enterprises to private companies.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that Argentina sought UK expertise on privatization and agriculture, which is a specific area of expertise. While it's possible that the UK's expertise in privatization could be applicable to agriculture, there is no information in the premise to suggest that Argentina was specifically seeking expertise in that area.  The premise only mentions that Argentina was looking for help on its privatization program, which could be a broader area that encompasses various sectors, including agriculture. Therefore, the hypothesis makes an assumption that is not supported by the given information.
1760486222	1760486223	Premise: Instead of action on crime, we got the federal long gun registry, which became a bloated bureaucratic nightmare to responsible hunters, farmers and rural Canadians. It cost taxpayers some CA$2 billion and it hasn't done a thing to reduce gun crime. said Harper. The Conservatives have provided amnesty for unregistered gun owners. At this time there is no legislation set before the House of Commons. Conservative Garry Breitkreuz from Saskatchewan tabled the bill killing the long-gun registry.  Hypothesis: Garry Breitkreuz is a member of the Conservative Party.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Garry Breitkreuz "tabled the bill killing the long-gun registry." This implies that Garry Breitkreuz is associated with the bill, and as a member of the Conservative Party, it is reasonable to infer that he is the one who tabled the bill. In parliamentary procedures, it is common for members of a party to table bills, especially those that reflect their party's stance on an issue.  Furthermore, the fact that the bill is presented as a Conservative initiative (as indicated by the phrase "Conservative Garry Breitkreuz") further supports the hypothesis. This suggests that Breitkreuz is a Conservative member of Parliament and that the bill is a manifestation of the party's policy.  Therefore, the hypothesis that Garry Breitkreuz is a member of the Conservative Party logically follows from the premise.
1760486223	1760486224	Premise: The researchers in the latest study fed one group of mice a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat. The diet started when the mice, all males, were 1 year old, which is middle-age in mouse longevity. As expected, the mice soon developed signs of impending diabetes, with grossly enlarged livers, and started to die much sooner than mice fed a standard diet.  Hypothesis: At the age of one year, male mice were fed with a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the researchers fed a group of mice a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat. However, it does not state that the mice were fed this diet at the age of one year. The hypothesis states that the mice were fed this diet "at the age of one year," which implies a specific temporal relationship between the diet and the age of the mice.  The premise only provides information about the composition of the diet, but not about when it was introduced. Therefore, we cannot infer that the hypothesis is true based on the premise. The hypothesis requires additional information to be supported, such as when the diet was introduced, to establish a clear temporal relationship between the diet and the observed effects.
1760486224	1760486225	Premise: The soldiers, who were said to have been wearing Arab headdress, were accused of firing at Iraqi police when stopped at a road block.  Hypothesis: The soldiers were driving a civilian car and were dressed in civilian clothes when a shooting took place between them and Iraqi patrols.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that the soldiers were accused of firing at Iraqi police when stopped at a roadblock, implying that the soldiers were wearing Arab headdress, which suggests they were likely Iraqi soldiers.   The hypothesis, however, states that the soldiers were driving a civilian car and were dressed in civilian clothes, which contradicts the implication that the soldiers were indeed Iraqi soldiers.   Therefore, the hypothesis cannot logically follow from the premise, as it provides an alternative explanation that is mutually exclusive with the information given in the premise.
1760486225	1760486226	Premise: The United States would like to see U.N. weapons inspectors return to Iraq providing the Iraqis take concrete, affirmative and demonstrable actions "to show full co-operation" Clinton said.  Hypothesis: U.N. weapons inspectors could stay in Iraq, Clinton said.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the United States wants U.N. weapons inspectors to return to Iraq, but only if the Iraqis take concrete, affirmative, and demonstrable actions "to show full co-operation". This implies that the inspectors will not return unless the Iraqis meet these conditions.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that U.N. weapons inspectors will stay in Iraq. This statement does not mention any conditions or requirements for the inspectors to stay, and it does not take into account the Iraqis' actions or co-operation.  Therefore, the hypothesis is not a logical consequence of the premise, as it does not follow from the information provided.
1760486226	1760486227	Premise: On 12 August, the San Carlos Battalion came across mines placed in their path and one soldier was killed while two were seriously injured. Meanwhile on 10 August, urban commandos took a patrol car by surprise and dropped a grenade inside the car, injuring four and partially destroying the vehicle.  Hypothesis: A patrol car was attacked by the San Carlos Battalion.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise mentions that the San Carlos Battalion came across mines and one soldier was killed, and another incident occurred on a different date (10 August) involving urban commandos and a patrol car. There is no connection between these two events, and it is not stated that the urban commandos were the ones who attacked the patrol car.  The premise only mentions the San Carlos Battalion, and the hypothesis assumes a direct connection between the San Carlos Battalion and the patrol car incident, which is not supported by the premise.
1760486227	1760486228	Premise: Bomb-sniffing dogs were brought to Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment.  Hypothesis: Bomb-sniffing dogs were estimated at Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that bomb-sniffing dogs were brought to Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment, which implies that the dogs were present at the apartment. However, the hypothesis states that bomb-sniffing dogs were estimated at Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment, which implies that the dogs were not necessarily present at the apartment, but rather were estimated or observed in some way.  To make the hypothesis follow from the premise, it would need to be rephrased to something like: "Bomb-sniffing dogs were observed at Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment." This revised hypothesis would more directly follow from the premise.
1760486228	1760486230	Premise: Startling new research into mobile phones claims they may reduce a man's sperm count by up to 30%.  Hypothesis: Male fertility may be affected by use of a mobile phones.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not directly follow from the premise. Here's why:  The premise states that "new research claims that mobile phones may reduce a man's sperm count by up to 30%". This statement implies that the research has found a correlation between mobile phone use and reduced sperm count, but it does not provide any information about the causal relationship between the two.  In order to make a hypothesis that male fertility may be affected by mobile phones, we would need to know that the research found a causal link between mobile phone use and reduced sperm count. The hypothesis would require evidence that mobile phones are the cause of the reduced sperm count, rather than just a correlation.  For example, the hypothesis could be rephrased to: "Mobile phone use is likely to reduce male fertility by causing a decrease in sperm count." This revised hypothesis would follow more closely from the premise, as it implies a causal relationship between the two variables.  Without more information, the original hypothesis is too broad and makes an unsubstantiated claim about the causal relationship between mobile phone use and male fertility.
1760486230	1760486231	Premise: Workers at the Lufthansa Technik Automotive plant in Co Dublin are due to vote today on changes to work practices being sought by the company's management. The aircraft engine maintenace firm has warned that rejection of the proposals would threaten a planned €17230m investment in the Rathcoole plant and put jobs at risk. LTA says it is not seeking any lay-offs or pay cuts and the planned investment would guarantee the future of the plant for the next 15 years. The work-practice changes are being sought following the collapse of Labour Relations Commission talks on the matter.  Hypothesis: Lufthansa Technik Automotive fires 30 workers.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that the company is not seeking any lay-offs or pay cuts. It also mentions that the planned investment would guarantee the future of the plant for the next 15 years. These statements directly contradict the hypothesis, which states that the company is planning to fire 30 workers.   Given the information provided, it is unlikely that the company would pursue layoffs or job losses, especially since the proposed changes to work practices are a result of failed Labour Relations Commission talks, and the company is instead seeking investment to secure the plant's future.
1760486231	1760486232	Premise: It rewrites the rules of global trade, established by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, in 1947, and modified in multiple rounds of negotiations since then.  Hypothesis: GATT was formed in 1947.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that GATT was rewritten, implying that GATT was previously established, but not necessarily in 1947. The fact that GATT was modified in multiple rounds of negotiations suggests that it was already existing before the rewriting.   The hypothesis assumes that GATT was formed in 1947, which is not necessarily implied by the premise. The premise only mentions that GATT was rewritten, without providing any information about its original formation date.
1760486232	1760486233	Premise: Vice President Dick Cheney on Tuesday hurled an obscenity on the Senate floor to punctuate an angry exchange with Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy as all senators gathered for their annual photo.  Hypothesis: Cheney cursed at Sen. Patrick Leahy.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Vice President Dick Cheney hurled an obscenity on the Senate floor, but it does not specify what he hurled at Sen. Patrick Leahy. The hypothesis, however, makes a specific claim about what Cheney said to Leahy (cursed at him). The premise only mentions the location (Senate floor) and the fact that Cheney was involved in an angry exchange with Leahy, but it does not provide any information about the content of their exchange. Therefore, we cannot infer that Cheney cursed at Leahy from the premise.
1760486233	1760486234	Premise: In the May 2005 general election Michael Howard failed to unseat the Labour Government, although the Conservatives did gain 33 seats, playing the most significant role in reducing Labour's majority from 167 to 66.  Hypothesis: In the May 2005 general election Conservatives got 33 seats.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Conservatives gained 33 seats and reduced Labour's majority from 167 to 66. However, it does not state that the Conservatives won these 33 seats. It only states that they gained 33 seats in total, without specifying whether these seats were new gains or whether they were gained from Labour seats.  Therefore, it is possible that the 33 seats gained by the Conservatives were either by winning new seats or by winning seats from other parties (not Labour), which is not mentioned in the premise. The hypothesis assumes that the 33 seats gained by the Conservatives were all from Labour, which is not necessarily true based on the given information.
1760486234	1760486235	Premise: The Norwegian Newspaper Corpus is a large and self-expanding corpus of Norwegian newspaper texts. The collection of this dynamic and continually growing corpus began in 1998.  Hypothesis: Dagbladet is a Norwegian newspaper.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Norwegian Newspaper Corpus is a large and self-expanding corpus of Norwegian newspaper texts, and that the collection began in 1998. This provides information about the nature and scope of the corpus, but it does not provide any information about the specific newspaper that the corpus contains.  To support the hypothesis that Dagbladet is the newspaper in the corpus, additional information would be needed, such as the fact that Dagbladet is a Norwegian newspaper that was in publication during the time period when the corpus was being collected (i.e., from 1998 onwards).  The premise does not provide any evidence to support the hypothesis, so it is not logically entailed.
1760486235	1760486237	Premise: The Dutch, who ruled Indonesia until 1949, called the city of Jakarta Batavia.  Hypothesis: Formerly ( until 1949 ) Batavia, Jakarta is largest city and capital of Indonesia.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Dutch ruled Indonesia until 1949 and that the city of Jakarta was called Batavia during that time. However, it does not imply that Jakarta was the largest city in Indonesia at that time. In fact, during the Dutch colonial period, the city of Surabaya was the largest city in Indonesia.  The hypothesis assumes that Jakarta was the largest city and capital of Indonesia, but the premise only provides information about the name of the city during the Dutch colonial period. There is no information in the premise about the size or status of Jakarta compared to other cities in Indonesia.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.
1760486237	1760486238	Premise: The name for the newest James Bond film has been announced today. The 22nd film, previously known only as "Bond 22", will be called "Quantum of Solace". EON Productions who are producing the film made the announcement today at Pinewood Studios, where production for the film has been under way since last year. The name of the film was inspired by a short story (of the same name) from For Your Eyes Only by Bond creator, Ian Fleming.  Hypothesis: James Bond was created by Ian Fleming.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the 22nd James Bond film is called "Quantum of Solace" and that it was inspired by a short story of the same name from For Your Eyes Only by Bond creator Ian Fleming. However, the hypothesis states that James Bond was created by Ian Fleming.  The premise does not provide any information that links Ian Fleming's creation of James Bond to the title of the film. It only mentions that the film was inspired by a short story of the same name by Fleming, but it does not imply that Fleming created the character of James Bond. Therefore, the hypothesis is not a logical conclusion based on the premise.
1760486238	1760486239	Premise: The gastric bypass operation, also known as stomach stapling, has become the most common surgical procedure for treating obesity.  Hypothesis: Obesity is medically treated.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the gastric bypass operation, also known as stomach stapling, has become the most common surgical procedure for treating obesity. However, this premise only provides information about a specific surgical procedure, and it does not imply that obesity itself is medically treated.  The hypothesis states that obesity is medically treated, which is a more general statement that requires evidence to support it. The premise only provides information about a specific treatment (gastric bypass surgery), not about the treatment of obesity in general. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.
1760486239	1760486240	Premise: The cost of the consumer of the United States fell in June.  Hypothesis: U.S. consumer spending dived in June.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the cost of the consumer in the United States fell in June. However, the hypothesis states that U.S. consumer spending dived in June. The two statements are related, but not logically equivalent.  The premise only provides information about the cost of the consumer, whereas the hypothesis makes a claim about the level of consumer spending. The cost of the consumer is not necessarily the same as consumer spending. Consumer spending is the actual amount spent by consumers, whereas the cost of the consumer refers to the amount that consumers pay.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise because the premise does not provide sufficient information to make a logical conclusion about consumer spending.
1760486240	1760486241	Premise: The former leader of Iraq was rushed to hospital last Sunday after refusing to eat for sixteen days. But according to news agencies, he has ended the hunger strike by eating lunch at the court in Baghdad. "Saddam ate beef and rice and cola with bread which he brought from hospital," one source told Reuters news agency. He was fasting with three co-defendants, and they were demanding more security for their defence lawyers, three of whom have been murdered.  Hypothesis: Some Australians have fasted to protest.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the former leader of Iraq was rushed to the hospital after refusing to eat for sixteen days, but it does not provide any information about Australians or their fasting habits. The information about the Iraqi leader's hunger strike and his eating lunch at the court is unrelated to Australians. Therefore, the hypothesis that some Australians have fasted to protest is not supported by the premise.
1760486241	1760486241	Premise: Sonia Gandhi can be defeated in the next elections in India by BJP.  Hypothesis: Sonia Gandhi is defeated by BJP.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Sonia Gandhi can be defeated in the next elections in India by the BJP, but it does not provide any information about Sonia Gandhi herself. It only mentions that the BJP has the potential to defeat her, but it does not make any claims about Sonia Gandhi's chances or abilities.  Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that Sonia Gandhi will be defeated by the BJP based on the premise alone. The hypothesis that Sonia Gandhi is defeated by the BJP is an assumption that adds additional information not provided by the premise.
1760486241	1760486243	Premise: Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has said that Mahmoud Abbas is a man that Israel can do business with.  Hypothesis: Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, may be someone Israel can talk with.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has said that Mahmoud Abbas is a man that Israel can do business with. This implies that Abbas has demonstrated a willingness to engage in negotiations or cooperation with Israel.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Abbas may be someone Israel can talk with, which is a more general statement that does not necessarily imply a willingness to engage in business or negotiations.  The hypothesis is too broad and does not follow from the premise, which provides specific information about Sharon's views on Abbas. The premise does not provide enough information to make a general claim about Abbas's willingness to engage in dialogue with Israel.
1760486243	1760486244	Premise: The Tempe Hometown Premiere will have all the trappings of a mega-Hollywood  event including red carpet arrivals, klieg lights, screaming fans, paparazzi and  media coverage of the film`s stars headed by Wolverine himself, Hugh Jackman and  including Liev Schreiber, Ryan Reynolds, Taylor Kitsch, Lynn Collins, will.i.am  and director Gavin Hood.  Following a hard-fought contest stretching over thousands of cities and towns  across the United States, Tempe emerged triumphant in a far-reaching, citywide  bid to nab the gala event. Mayor Hugh Hallman himself rallied the community,  which stepped up with dozens of videos that were posted on YouTube.  Hypothesis: Hugh Jackman plays the role of Wolverine in the movie.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  Here's why:  1. The premise mentions "Wolverine himself, Hugh Jackman", which directly states that Hugh Jackman is playing the role of Wolverine. 2. The mention of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is a specific detail that is not just a general reference to the character, but rather a confirmation that he is indeed the actor playing the role. 3. The hypothesis is a specific claim about Hugh Jackman's role in the movie, which is directly supported by the information provided in the premise.  Therefore, based on the information provided in the premise, the hypothesis is a logical conclusion that can be drawn.
1760486244	1760486245	Premise: In October, however, amid rising tensions between the government and opposition groups, a car bomb seriously injured an opposition politician and killed his driver, in Beirut.  Hypothesis: A member of the opposition was injured in a car bomb attack in Beirut.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that a car bomb "seriously injured an opposition politician and killed his driver, in Beirut". However, the hypothesis states that a member of the opposition was injured in a car bomb attack in Beirut. The hypothesis is too vague and does not specify that the injured individual is a politician.  The premise specifically mentions an opposition politician and his driver, so we can infer that the injured individual is likely the politician, but the hypothesis does not provide any information that would lead us to conclude that the injured individual is a member of the opposition in general. Therefore, the hypothesis is not a logical conclusion based on the premise.
1760486245	1760486246	Premise: Weinstock painstakingly reviewed dozens of studies for evidence of any link between sunscreen use and either an increase or decrease in melanoma.  Hypothesis: skin cancer numbers increase.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Weinstock "painstakingly reviewed dozens of studies" for evidence of a link between sunscreen use and skin cancer. This implies that the premise is focused on investigating the relationship between sunscreen use and skin cancer, but it does not provide any information about the outcome of the review.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, makes a specific claim about the direction of the relationship (i.e., that skin cancer numbers increase) without providing any evidence. The hypothesis is a conclusion that would be drawn from the research, but it is not directly supported by the premise.  In other words, the premise sets up an investigation, while the hypothesis makes a specific prediction about the outcome of that investigation. The hypothesis is not a logical consequence of the premise, as the premise does not provide any information about the results of the research.
1760486246	1760486248	Premise: Most people are familiar with the idea of St. Bernards or other dogs taking part in rescue and recovery efforts. Robots might also take part in search and rescue missions.  Hypothesis: Robots are used to find missing victims.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that St. Bernards or other dogs are used in rescue and recovery efforts. This implies that the focus is on canine-based search and rescue missions, not robotic ones.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that robots are used to find missing victims. This is a different scenario that is not necessarily implied by the premise.  To make the hypothesis follow from the premise, additional information would be needed, such as:  * The premise could be modified to include robots in rescue and recovery efforts, e.g., "Robots or dogs are used in rescue and recovery efforts." * The premise could imply that robots are being used in search and rescue missions, e.g., "Dogs are being replaced by robots in search and rescue efforts."  Without this additional information, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.
1760486248	1760486249	Premise: Illinois born Charlton Heston was a 27-year-old actor from Broadway and television when he arrived in Hollywood for a five-picture contract with Hal Wallis.  Hypothesis: Charlton Heston was born in Illinois.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Charlton Heston was 27 years old and had just arrived in Hollywood for a five-picture contract with Hal Wallis. This information does not provide any information about Charlton Heston's birthplace.  However, the hypothesis states that Charlton Heston was born in Illinois. This is a specific claim about Charlton Heston's birthplace, which is not supported by the premise.  To follow from the premise, the hypothesis would need to be supported by information that directly relates to Charlton Heston's birthplace or age. The premise only mentions his age and his career in Hollywood, but does not provide any information about his birthplace.
1760486249	1760486250	Premise: Ruth's 1927 single season record of 60 home runs stood unsurpassed until Roger Maris hit 61 in 1961.  Hypothesis: Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs in his lifetime.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Ruth's 1927 single-season record of 60 home runs stood unsurpassed until Roger Maris hit 61 in 1961. This implies that the record of 60 home runs was broken, and that 60 home runs is the highest number of home runs hit in a single season.  However, the hypothesis states that Ruth hit 60 home runs in his lifetime, not in a single season. This is a different claim, and the premise does not provide any information about Ruth's overall career statistics. Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.
1760486250	1760486251	Premise: The German technology was employed to build Shanghai's existing maglev line, the first in the world to be used commercially.  Hypothesis: Maglev is commercially used.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the German technology was employed to build Shanghai's existing maglev line, which is the first in the world to be used commercially. However, this premise does not provide any information about whether the technology is commercially used.  The hypothesis states that maglev is commercially used. While the premise mentions that the Shanghai maglev line is commercially used, it does not imply that maglev technology in general is commercially used. The premise only talks about the specific application of German technology to build the Shanghai maglev line, but it does not provide any information about the broader application of maglev technology.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.
1760486251	1760486252	Premise: SEATTLE — United Nations gang leader Clay Roueche should spend at least 30 years behind bars after his surprise guilty plea here Tuesday for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine, marijuana and illicit drug profits, U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Sullivan said. Sullivan said outside court that Roueche's leadership of the violent UN gang and the sophistication of the international drug conspiracy will all be factors used to argue for a longer sentence — up to life — for the 33-year-old Canadian. And he stressed that the plea agreement reached with Roueche did not include "any kind of break with respect to sentencing.".  Hypothesis: Clay Roueche is 33 years old.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that Clay Roueche is a 33-year-old Canadian, but it does not provide any information about his age. The information about his age is a specific detail that is used to describe him, but it is not a conclusion drawn from the premise. Therefore, it is a separate piece of information that is not logically connected to the hypothesis.  In order for the hypothesis to follow from the premise, it would need to be a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the information presented. In this case, the premise does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis, so it does not logically follow.
1760486252	1760486254	Premise: Baker's voice will replace the earlier computer-synthesized voice that was previously used. BT said that his voice was chosen as it was instantly recognisable. It took him 11 days to record 11,593 phrases and sounds which could then be broken down and reassembled by a computer to make new words. It then took five months to process these recordings to make a workable service. BT have said that there will be no barriers as to what Tom Baker's voice can 'say', including rude words. "What appeals to me most is the thought that I will be bringing good news to people whether it is a cheeky message, a birthday greeting, or just a quick hello," said Baker.  Hypothesis: Tom Baker works for BT.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis "Tom Baker works for BT" follows from the premise. Here's why:  1. The premise states that Baker's voice was chosen by BT, which implies that he is affiliated with the company. 2. The premise also mentions that Baker recorded 11,593 phrases and sounds for BT, which suggests that he is an employee or contractor of the company. 3. The fact that the voice is being used for a service that can be customized and reassembled by a computer further implies that Baker is involved in the development or implementation of this service.  The statement from Baker himself, "What appeals to me most is the thought that I will be bringing good news to people...", is not directly related to his employment, but it suggests that he is enthusiastic about the project and its purpose, which is consistent with the idea that he works for a company like BT.  Therefore, the hypothesis "Tom Baker works for BT" is a reasonable inference based on the information provided in the premise.
1760486254	1760486255	Premise: The Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for the selection of the candidates and the choice of Prize Winners for the Peace Prize. The Committee is composed of five members appointed by the Storting (Norwegian parliament). The Peace Prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway and not in Stockholm, Sweden like the other Nobel Prizes.  Hypothesis: Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for the selection of the candidates and the choice of Prize Winners for the Peace Prize, but it does not provide any information about the criteria or process for selecting the winners. It also does not provide information about the frequency or timing of the selection process.  The hypothesis "Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen" makes an assumption about the outcome of the selection process, but the premise does not provide any information that would support or imply that the selection process has taken place or that winners have been chosen. Therefore, the hypothesis is not necessarily true based on the information provided in the premise.
1760486255	1760486256	Premise: More than 150 dolphins, marine turtles and beaked whales have been washed up dead on beaches in Africa.  Hypothesis: Dead dolphins, turtles and whales have been found on African beaches.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that more than 150 dolphins, marine turtles, and beaked whales have been washed up dead on beaches in Africa. However, the hypothesis states that dead dolphins, turtles, and whales have been found on African beaches. The word "on" is crucial here. The premise specifies that the animals were washed up on beaches, implying that the animals were found on the beaches, whereas the hypothesis simply states that the animals were found on African beaches.  To make the hypothesis follow from the premise, it should be revised to "Have been washed up dead on African beaches" to accurately reflect the information provided in the premise.
