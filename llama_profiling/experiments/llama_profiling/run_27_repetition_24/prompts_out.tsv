1760598683	1760598684	Premise: No Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq Yet.  Hypothesis: Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that no Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) have been found in Iraq yet. This implies that there has been a search or investigation for WMDs in Iraq, but so far, no evidence of their existence has been discovered.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that WMDs have been found in Iraq. This is the exact opposite of what the premise states, which means that the hypothesis cannot be logically deduced from the premise.  In other words, the premise provides information about the absence of WMDs, while the hypothesis makes a positive claim about the presence of WMDs. These two statements are mutually exclusive, and therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.	160	
1760598684	1760598685	Premise: A place of sorrow, after Pope John Paul II died, became a place of celebration, as Roman Catholic faithful gathered in downtown Chicago to mark the installation of new Pope Benedict XVI.  Hypothesis: Pope Benedict XVI is the new leader of the Roman Catholic Church.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Pope John Paul II died, and people gathered in downtown Chicago to mark the installation of a new Pope. However, it does not provide any information about the identity of the new Pope. The hypothesis assumes that the new Pope is Benedict XVI, which is not supported by the premise.  The correct inference would be that the new Pope is likely to be the person who was to be installed, but the premise does not provide enough information to confirm that Benedict XVI is the new Pope.	113	
1760598685	1760598686	Premise: Herceptin was already approved to treat the sickest breast cancer patients, and the company said, Monday, it will discuss with federal regulators the possibility of prescribing the drug for more breast cancer patients.  Hypothesis: Herceptin can be used to treat breast cancer.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Herceptin was already approved to treat the sickest breast cancer patients, but it does not say that Herceptin can treat breast cancer in general. It only specifies that it is approved for the sickest patients.  The hypothesis is that Herceptin can be used to treat breast cancer, which is a more general claim that is not necessarily supported by the premise. The premise only provides information about the approval of Herceptin for a specific subgroup of breast cancer patients (the sickest ones), and does not provide any information about its effectiveness or safety in other patient populations.  Therefore, the hypothesis is an unjustified leap and does not logically follow from the premise.	153	
1760598686	1760598688	Premise: Judie Vivian, chief executive at ProMedica, a medical service company that helps sustain the 2-year-old Vietnam Heart Institute in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), said that so far about 1,500 children have received treatment.  Hypothesis: The previous name of Ho Chi Minh City was Saigon.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Judie Vivian, the chief executive at ProMedica, is involved with the Vietnam Heart Institute in Ho Chi Minh City. This establishes a connection between ProMedica and the Vietnam Heart Institute, but it does not provide any information about the name of Ho Chi Minh City.  The hypothesis states that the previous name of Ho Chi Minh City was Saigon. This is a historical fact that is not supported by the premise, which only mentions the current name of the city (Ho Chi Minh City) and the name of the institute (Vietnam Heart Institute). The premise does not provide any information about the city's name history.  Therefore, the hypothesis is not a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the premise.	162	
1760598688	1760598689	Premise: A man is due in court later charged with the murder 26 years ago of a teenager whose case was the first to be featured on BBC One's Crimewatch. Colette Aram, 16, was walking to her boyfriend's house in Keyworth, Nottinghamshire, on 30 October 1983 when she disappeared. Her body was later found in a field close to her home. Paul Stewart Hutchinson, 50, has been charged with murder and is due before Nottingham magistrates later.  Hypothesis: Paul Stewart Hutchinson is accused of having stabbed a girl.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Paul Stewart Hutchinson is due in court charged with murder, and that the victim was a 16-year-old girl named Colette Aram who was murdered 26 years ago. However, it does not provide any information about the method of murder, such as whether it was a stabbing.  The hypothesis states that Paul Stewart Hutchinson is accused of having stabbed a girl, which is a specific and detailed claim about the nature of the crime. While it is possible that the hypothesis may be true, it is not explicitly stated in the premise, and there is no reason to assume that the method of murder is relevant to the fact that Paul Stewart Hutchinson is due in court charged with murder.	153	
1760598689	1760598690	Premise: Britain said, Friday, that it has barred cleric, Omar Bakri, from returning to the country from Lebanon, where he was released by police after being detained for 24 hours.  Hypothesis: Bakri was briefly detained, but was released.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Britain has barred cleric Omar Bakri from returning to the country, but it does not provide information about his current location or status. The hypothesis states that Bakri was briefly detained, but was released. However, the premise does not provide any information that would necessarily imply that Bakri was detained or released. The premise only mentions that he was barred from returning, without specifying his current status or actions.  For the hypothesis to follow from the premise, there would need to be additional information that links the two, such as ""Bakri was briefly detained by the authorities before being barred from returning"" or ""Bakri was released by police after being detained"". Without this additional information, the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis."	167	1.0
1760598690	1760598692	Premise: Nearly 4 million children who have at least one parent who entered the U.S. illegally were born in the United States and are U.S. citizens as a result, according to the study conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center. That's about three quarters of the estimated 5.5 million children of illegal immigrants inside the United States, according to the study. About 1.8 million children of undocumented immigrants live in poverty, the study found.  Hypothesis: Three quarters of U.S. illegal immigrants have children.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that nearly 4 million children have at least one parent who entered the U.S. illegally and are U.S. citizens, and that this represents about three quarters of the estimated 5.5 million children of undocumented immigrants inside the U.S. This suggests that the number of undocumented immigrants is significantly larger than the number of U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants.  The hypothesis, however, states that ""Three quarters of U.S. illegal immigrants have children."" This hypothesis is not supported by the premise, which does not imply that all undocumented immigrants have children. In fact, the premise suggests that only a subset of undocumented immigrants (those who have children) is represented among the nearly 4 million U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants.  To make the hypothesis follow from the premise, the premise would need to be revised to include the fact that undocumented immigrants who have children are a significant proportion of the undocumented population. For example: ""About 75% of undocumented immigrants have children."" Only then would the hypothesis follow from the premise."	225	0.8888888888888888
1760598692	1760598693	Premise: Like the United States, U.N. officials are also dismayed that Aristide killed a conference called by Prime Minister Robert Malval in Port-au-Prince in hopes of bringing all the feuding parties together.  Hypothesis: Aristide had Prime Minister Robert Malval  murdered in Port-au-Prince.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that U.N. officials are dismayed that Aristide killed a conference called by Prime Minister Robert Malval in Port-au-Prince in hopes of bringing all the feuding parties together. However, the hypothesis states that Aristide had Prime Minister Robert Malval murdered, not that Aristide was the one who attended and killed the conference.  The premise implies that Aristide was involved in the murder of the conference, but it does not specify that he was the one who committed the act. The hypothesis, on the other hand, attributes the murder directly to Aristide, which is not necessarily supported by the premise.   The correct inference would be that Aristide was involved in the murder of the conference, but the hypothesis makes an unwarranted assumption about Aristide's role in the event.	175	
1760598693	1760598695	Premise: WASHINGTON --  A newly declassified narrative of the Bush administration's advice to the CIA on harsh interrogations shows that the small group of Justice Department lawyers who wrote memos authorizing controversial interrogation techniques were operating not on their own but with direction from top administration officials, including then-Vice President Dick Cheney and national security adviser Condoleezza Rice. At the same time, the narrative suggests that then-Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and then-Secretary of State Colin Powell were largely left out of the decision-making process.  Hypothesis: Dick Cheney was the Vice President of Bush.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise. The premise states that Dick Cheney was involved in the direction of the Justice Department lawyers who wrote memos authorizing controversial interrogation techniques. This implies that Cheney was not just a passive figure, but an active participant in the decision-making process. As Vice President, Cheney would have had significant influence over the administration's policies and would have played a key role in shaping the guidance provided to the Justice Department lawyers.  The fact that Cheney was involved in the decision-making process suggests that he was not just a figurehead, but a key player in the administration's policies, which is what the hypothesis states. Therefore, the hypothesis is supported by the premise.	139	
1760598695	1760598696	Premise: Only a week after it had no comment on upping the storage capacity of its Hotmail e-mail service, Microsoft early Thursday announced it was boosting the allowance to 250MB to follow similar moves by rivals such as Google, Yahoo, and Lycos.  Hypothesis: Microsoft's Hotmail has raised its storage capacity to 250MB.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Microsoft ""early Thursday announced it was boosting the allowance to 250MB"", which implies that the announcement was made on Thursday. However, the hypothesis states that the storage capacity was raised to 250MB ""only a week after it had no comment on upping the storage capacity of its Hotmail e-mail service"". This suggests that the announcement was made a week after the original lack of comment, not on the same day.  Therefore, the hypothesis contradicts the premise, as the timing of the announcement is different."	121	
1760598696	1760598696	Premise: Lina Joy, 42, was born Azlina Jailani to Malay parents, and was raised as a Muslim. Malaysia's constitution guarantees freedom of religion, but by law, all ethnic Malays are Muslim. Joy converted to Christianity at age 26, and after some bureaucratic difficulties had her named legally changed in 1999. However, on her MyKad national ID, the National Registration Department retained her stated religion as Islam. In order to have her religion changed, the National Registration Department said Joy would have to obtain a certificate of apostasy from the Muslim Sharia Court.  Hypothesis: Lina Joy's parents are from Malaysia.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Lina Joy was born Azlina Jailani to Malay parents, which implies that her parents are from Malaysia. This is a direct statement that establishes a connection between Lina Joy's parents and Malaysia. The hypothesis is simply a statement that Lina Joy's parents are from Malaysia, which is a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the information provided in the premise.	89	
1760598696	1760598698	Premise: November 9, 1989 , the day the Berlin Wall fell and the world changed forever . Not even the most astute saw it coming . As Hungary's foreign minister in the late summer of 1989 , Gyula Horn gave the order to let visiting East Germans use his country to do a 400-mile end run around the Berlin Wall , a move now seen as the beginning of the end for hard-line communism in Europe .  Hypothesis: The Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Gyula Horn, the Hungarian foreign minister, allowed East Germans to use Hungary to do a 400-mile end run around the Berlin Wall, which is seen as a significant event that contributed to the downfall of hard-line communism in Europe. However, the premise does not explicitly state that the Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989.  The premise only mentions the event as a precursor to the eventual fall of communism, but it does not provide direct evidence that the wall was actually torn down. The actual event of the Berlin Wall being torn down occurred on November 9, 1989, several months after Gyula Horn's decision to allow East Germans to use Hungary as a route to escape.  Therefore, the hypothesis that the Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989 is not necessarily implied by the premise.	181	
1760598698	1760598699	"Premise: Valero Energy Corp., on Monday, said it found ""extensive"" additional damage at its 250,000-barrel-per-day Port Arthur refinery.  Hypothesis: Valero Energy Corp. produces 250,000 barrels per day.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Valero Energy Corp. found ""extensive"" additional damage at its Port Arthur refinery. This implies that the damage is significant, but it does not provide information about the refinery's production capacity.  The hypothesis states that Valero Energy Corp. produces 250,000 barrels per day, which is a specific claim about the refinery's production capacity. The premise does not provide any information that would support this hypothesis, and the fact that the refinery has damage does not necessarily mean that it is producing 250,000 barrels per day.  Therefore, the hypothesis is not logically entailed by the premise, and it is not a reasonable inference to draw from the given information."	152	
1760598699	1760598700	Premise: Oil prices fall back as Yukos oil threat lifted  Hypothesis: Oil prices rise.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the ""Yukos oil threat"" has been lifted, which implies that a potential disruption to oil supplies has been eliminated. This would typically lead to an increase in oil prices as supply is restored and demand remains constant. However, the hypothesis states that oil prices will rise, which is the opposite of what would be expected if the premise is true.  A more logical conclusion would be that oil prices would fall, not rise, as the removal of the threat would lead to increased supply and decreased prices."	118	
1760598700	1760598701	Premise: Brian Brohm, the Louisville quarterback, threw for 368 yards and five touchdowns as the Cardinals beat visiting Oregon State 63-27.  Hypothesis: The quarterback threw for 413 yards and three touchdowns, and then ran to the end zone two more times.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Brian Brohm threw for 368 yards and five touchdowns, but it does not provide any information about his rushing statistics. The hypothesis, on the other hand, includes two additional statements that are not supported by the premise: throwing for 413 yards and running for two more touchdowns.  Therefore, the hypothesis makes assumptions that are not justified by the information provided in the premise, and it does not logically follow from it.	101	1.0
1760598701	1760598702	"Premise: Greg Page, a former heavyweight boxing champion who suffered a severe brain injury in a 2001 fight, has died at 50. His wife Patricia said the one-time WBA champion had died at his home in Kentucky, USA, of complications related to injuries he suffered in the fight. Page was in a coma for a week after the 9 March 2001 fight against Dale Crowe which was stopped in the 10th round. Patricia Page said he was ""in a better place now"" after announcing on Monday he had died overnight in his sleep.  Hypothesis: Greg Page was a WBA champion.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Greg Page suffered a severe brain injury in a 2001 fight and died at the age of 50 due to complications from that injury. However, it does not mention that he was a WBA champion.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, specifically states that Greg Page was a WBA champion. While it is possible that Greg Page was a WBA champion, the premise does not provide any information that would support this claim. In fact, the premise mentions that he was a ""one-time WBA champion"", which implies that he may not have been a reigning champion at the time of his death.  Therefore, the hypothesis is not supported by the premise, and it is not a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the information provided."	168	
1760598702	1760598703	"Premise: Sierra is likely to remain in jail at the Hillsborough County jail in her native Tampa until her next hearing on December 20, where she is being held without bail, which would prevent her attending the Washington event on Friday even if she still had permission to perform. Sierra has been in jail since the start of the month after an altercation with police officers outside a Tampa nightclub, which she had been ejected from. She is charged with disorderly intoxication and resisting arrest.  Hypothesis: Sierra once reached the finals of ""American Idol"".  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise provides information about Sierra's situation, including her current arrest, the charges she faces, and her potential inability to attend an event. However, it does not provide any information that would suggest she was ever involved in ""American Idol"" or that she has a history with the show.  In order for the hypothesis to follow from the premise, there would need to be some connection between the premise and the hypothesis. Since there is no such connection, the hypothesis is unfounded and does not logically follow from the premise."	118	
1760598703	1760598704	Premise: Since 1987, however, Brazil has taken steps to dramatically reduce the destruction, including stepped-up enforcement and the elimination of tax incentives that led to large-scale land clearing.  Hypothesis: In the early 1990s Brazil began to take action to save the rainforest.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Brazil has taken steps to dramatically reduce the destruction of the rainforest since 1987. This implies that there has been a significant change in Brazil's approach to managing its rainforests. The hypothesis states that Brazil began to take action to save the rainforest in the early 1990s, which is consistent with the idea that the country made progress in reducing destruction.  The key words in the premise that support this conclusion are ""since 1987"" and ""dramatically reduce"", which suggest a significant change in direction or policy. The hypothesis is a reasonable inference based on these words, as it implies that the changes in policy led to a shift from a period of destruction to a period of conservation efforts.  Overall, the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise, and it is reasonable to conclude that Brazil began to take action to save the rainforest in the early 1990s."	198	
1760598704	1760598705	"Premise: FIFA has received 11 bids to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments, an international football competition contested by the men's national teams. The countries vying to host the tournament are Australia, England, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Qatar, Russia, South Korea and United States, who have individual bids and the joint bids are from Belgium-Netherlands and Spain-Portugal.  Select bids are for 2018 and 2022 tournaments and two bids are just for the 2022 tournament. Qatar and South Korea are vying just for the 2022 tournament. The two winning bids will be chosen on December 2010 by the 24-man executive committee of FIFA.  Said FIFA president Sepp Blatter: ""We are very pleased about the fantastic level of interest in our flagship competition, with all initial bidders confirming their candidature.""  Hypothesis: Sepp Blatter is the president of FIFA.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that the FIFA president is mentioned as Sepp Blatter, and the statement from Sepp Blatter is quoted as saying ""We are very pleased about the fantastic level of interest in our flagship competition..."". This implies that the person speaking is indeed the FIFA president, which is Sepp Blatter. Therefore, the hypothesis ""Sepp Blatter is the president of FIFA"" logically follows from the premise."	95	
1760598705	1760598706	Premise: U.S. crude settled $1.32 lower at $42.83 a barrel.  Hypothesis: Crude the light American lowered to the closing 1.32 dollars, to 42.83 dollars the barrel.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"The hypothesis is incorrect.   The premise states that U.S. crude ""settled $1.32 lower"" at $42.83 a barrel. The word ""settled"" implies that the price of crude decreased by $1.32. However, the hypothesis states that the price increased to $42.83, which is lower than the original price.  A correct hypothesis would be: ""Crude the light American lowered to $42.83 a barrel."" This hypothesis accurately reflects the information in the premise, as it states that the price of crude decreased to $42.83."	121	
1760598706	1760598707	Premise: WINNENDEN, Germany ―A teenage gunman killed 15 people, most of them female, on Wednesday in a rampage that began at a school near Stuttgart in southern Germany and ended in a nearby town, where he then killed himself after the police wounded him. The attack left Germany, which tightened tough gun controls after a similar attack at a school seven years ago, struggling to understand the carnage that had again befallen it, a country with relatively little violent crime. In 2002, a gunman killed 16 people before killing himself at a school in Erfurt, in eastern Germany.  Hypothesis: In 2002 near Stuttgart a boy shot 16 people.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that in 2002, a gunman killed 16 people before killing himself at a school in Erfurt, in eastern Germany. However, the hypothesis states that the gunman was a boy, which is not mentioned in the premise. The premise only mentions the number of victims (16) and the location (Erfurt), but not the gunman's age or identity.  Therefore, the hypothesis is not supported by the premise, and it is not a logical consequence of the information provided.	114	
1760598707	1760598708	Premise: Many hopes are riding on the sale of Talisman's holdings in Palm Beach and Hendry counties, which Vice President Al Gore announced with much fanfare last year at the 50th anniversary of Everglades National Park.  Hypothesis: Everglades National Park is located in Florida.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  Here's why:  - The premise states that many hopes are riding on the sale of Talisman's holdings in Palm Beach and Hendry counties. - The hypothesis states that Everglades National Park is located in Florida. - Palm Beach and Hendry counties are both located in Florida. - Everglades National Park is situated within these counties, as it is located in the Everglades, a vast wetland ecosystem in southern Florida. - The connection between Talisman's holdings and the hopes for the sale of these holdings is likely tied to the location and potential for development or conservation of the land within the national park.  Given these connections, it is reasonable to infer that Everglades National Park is located in Florida, which is the hypothesis.	163	
1760598708	1760598710	Premise: Rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy and ultimately death. Early symptoms of rabies in humans are nonspecific, consisting of fever, headache, and general malaise.  Hypothesis: Rabies is fatal in humans.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that the rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy and ultimately death, but it does not explicitly state that the virus is fatal. The premise only mentions that the symptoms of rabies in humans are nonspecific and include fever, headache, and general malaise, but it does not specify that these symptoms are always fatal.  In other words, the premise provides information about the effects of the virus on the central nervous system and the symptoms of rabies in humans, but it does not provide any information about the outcome or mortality rate of the disease. Therefore, we cannot conclude that rabies is fatal based on the premise alone.  To make the hypothesis follow from the premise, additional information would be needed to establish a clear causal link between the virus and the outcome of death. For example, the premise could be modified to state that ""the infection of the central nervous system by the rabies virus always leads to death."""	207	
1760598710	1760598712	Premise: American tobacco companies were showing a profit most quarters due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products sold including food.  Hypothesis: PM often entered markets with both cigarettes and food.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise. Here's why:  The premise states that American tobacco companies were showing a profit most quarters due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products sold, including food. This implies that the companies were successfully expanding their market presence and revenue streams beyond just cigarettes.  The hypothesis states that Philip Morris (PM) often entered markets with both cigarettes and food. This is a reasonable inference based on the premise, as the diversification of products sold, including food, suggests that PM was actively expanding its portfolio to reduce dependence on cigarettes and increase overall revenue.  Furthermore, PM is a well-known multinational tobacco company, and its history shows that it has indeed entered various markets with a range of products, including food. For example, PM's Kraft Foods division was a significant contributor to the company's revenue in the early 2000s.  Therefore, given the premise, it is reasonable to conclude that PM often entered markets with both cigarettes and food, making the hypothesis a logical and supported conclusion.	209	
1760598712	1760598713	Premise: The development of agriculture by early humans, roughly 10,000 years ago, was also harmful to many natural ecosystems as they were systematically destroyed and replaced with artificial versions.  Hypothesis: Humans existed 10,000 years ago.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the development of agriculture by early humans roughly 10,000 years ago was harmful to many natural ecosystems. This implies that humans existed at that time and were capable of developing agriculture.  However, the hypothesis states that humans existed 10,000 years ago, which is a specific claim about the timeline of human existence. The premise only mentions the development of agriculture, which could have occurred at any point in time, not necessarily 10,000 years ago.  To support the hypothesis, additional evidence would be needed to establish that humans existed 10,000 years ago. The premise only provides information about the impact of agriculture on ecosystems, not the existence of humans.	151	
1760598713	1760598714	Premise: The two young leaders of the coup, Pibul Songgram and Pridi Phanomyang, both educated in Europe and influenced by Western ideas, came to dominate Thai politics in the ensuing years.  Hypothesis: Pibul was a young leader.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that Pibul Songgram and Pridi Phanomyang were the two young leaders of the coup, but it does not specify that Pibul was the younger of the two. The phrase ""young leaders"" simply indicates that they were both relatively young, but it does not provide any information about their relative ages."	81	
1760598714	1760598715	"Premise: Lin Piao, after all, was the creator of Mao's ""Little Red Book"" of quotations.  Hypothesis: Lin Piao wrote the ""Little Red Book"".  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Lin Piao was the creator of Mao's ""Little Red Book"" of quotations. However, the hypothesis claims that Lin Piao wrote the ""Little Red Book"", which is a more specific and particular claim.  To follow from the premise, the hypothesis would need to be a more general claim, such as ""Lin Piao was involved in the creation of the 'Little Red Book'"". This is because the premise only mentions Lin Piao as the creator, but does not specify the exact nature of his involvement (writing).  The hypothesis, on the other hand, makes a specific claim about the content of the book (that Lin Piao wrote it), which is not supported by the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise."	170	
1760598715	1760598716	Premise: When patients interrupt a course of antibiotics, the surviving bacteria return with a vengeance, often having rapidly mutated to resist the therapy.  Hypothesis: Bacteria is winning the war against antibiotics.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that when patients interrupt a course of antibiotics, the surviving bacteria return with a vengeance, often having rapidly mutated to resist the therapy. This suggests that the bacteria have developed resistance to the antibiotics, which is a consequence of the incomplete treatment.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that bacteria are winning the war against antibiotics. This implies that the bacteria are not only resistant to antibiotics but are actually gaining the upper hand and causing the antibiotics to fail. The premise does not provide any information that suggests the bacteria are actively trying to defeat the antibiotics or gaining a strategic advantage over them.  In other words, the premise describes a situation where the bacteria are adapting to the antibiotics, while the hypothesis implies that the bacteria are actively fighting against the antibiotics. The premise does not provide enough information to support the idea that the bacteria are winning the war against antibiotics.	187	
1760598716	1760598717	Premise: Initially the Bundesbank opposed the introduction of the euro but was compelled to accept it in light of the political pressure of the capitalist politicians who supported its introduction.  Hypothesis: The introduction of the euro has been opposed.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Bundesbank initially opposed the introduction of the euro, but was ""compelled"" to accept it due to political pressure. This suggests that the Bundesbank did eventually accept the euro, rather than opposing it.  The hypothesis states that the introduction of the euro was opposed, which contradicts the information provided in the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise."	94	
1760598717	1760598718	Premise: The Armed Forces Press Committee (COPREFA) admitted that the government troops sustained 11 casualties in these clashes, adding that they inflicted three casualties on the rebels.  Hypothesis: Three rebels were killed by government troops.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that the government troops sustained 11 casualties and inflicted 3 casualties on the rebels. This implies that the 3 casualties inflicted on the rebels were not the only casualties of the government troops, as the premise mentions that they sustained 11 casualties in total.   The hypothesis, however, suggests that only 3 rebels were killed, which is a subset of the casualties inflicted on the rebels, but it does not account for the 8 other rebels who may have been injured or escaped.   Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.	126	
1760598718	1760598719	Premise: One economic study will not be the basis of Canada's public policy decisions, but Easton's research does conclusively show that there are economic benefits in the legalization of marijuana.  Hypothesis: Drug legalization has benefits.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that one economic study will not be the basis of Canada's public policy decisions, which implies that the study's findings are not conclusive or significant enough to influence policy. However, the hypothesis states that drug legalization has benefits, which is a positive assertion that contradicts the premise.  In other words, the premise suggests that the study's findings are not strong enough to justify policy changes, while the hypothesis makes a definitive claim about the benefits of drug legalization. These two statements are mutually exclusive, and the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.	125	
1760598719	1760598721	Premise: Archaeologists have found approximately 30 beautifully preserved mummies in a 4,000 year old Egyptian necropolis which held 53 tombs. Supervisor of Antiquities for Middle Egypt Dr. Abdel-Rahman El-Ayedi's team established his archaeological site in the Faiyum Oasis near the El-Lahun Egyptian pyramid which is just south of Cairo. Besides the mummies, the team found masks, amulets, clay pots and an offering table located in a funerary chapel. The chapel dates back to about 30 BC to 337 AD.  Hypothesis: 30 beautifully preserved mummies have been located in the south of Cairo.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the archaeological team discovered approximately 30 beautifully preserved mummies in a 4,000 year old Egyptian necropolis with 53 tombs near the El-Lahun Egyptian pyramid in the Faiyum Oasis. However, the hypothesis states that the mummies were located ""in the south of Cairo"".  The premise specifically mentions the Faiyum Oasis, which is located near the El-Lahun Egyptian pyramid, not in the city of Cairo. The Faiyum Oasis is a region, not a part of Cairo. Therefore, the hypothesis is not a logical conclusion based on the premise.  The correct hypothesis should be: ""The mummies were found in a 4,000 year old necropolis near the El-Lahun Egyptian pyramid in the Faiyum Oasis."""	171	
1760598721	1760598721	Premise: Gastrointestinal bleeding can happen as an adverse effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin or ibuprofen.  Hypothesis: Aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that gastrointestinal bleeding can happen as an adverse effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen. However, it does not state that aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding.  In fact, the premise suggests the opposite: that NSAIDs, including aspirin, can cause gastrointestinal bleeding as a side effect. The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding, which contradicts the premise.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.	122	
1760598721	1760598722	Premise: A former employee of the company, David Vance of South Portland, said Hooper spent a lot of time on the road, often meeting with customers between Portland and Kittery.  Hypothesis: Hooper is a citizen of Portland.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that David Vance of South Portland said Hooper spent a lot of time on the road, often meeting with customers between Portland and Kittery. This information about David Vance and his location (South Portland) is irrelevant to the hypothesis that Hooper is a citizen of Portland.  The hypothesis can be supported by other evidence, such as Hooper's work location, work hours, or other statements that suggest a connection to Portland. However, the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that Hooper is a citizen of Portland.	123	1.0
1760598722	1760598724	Premise: Cyprus, divided or not, joins the EU on the 1st of May.  Hypothesis: Cyprus was divided into two parts on May 1.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Cyprus joins the EU on May 1, but it does not provide any information about the division of the island. In fact, the premise implies that the division is already in place, as it states ""Cyprus, divided or not"".  The correct interpretation of the premise is that Cyprus joins the EU, regardless of whether it is already divided or not. The hypothesis is an incorrect assumption that the division is a condition for joining the EU, which is not supported by the premise.  The correct hypothesis would be: ""Cyprus joins the EU on May 1, regardless of whether it is already divided or not."""	142	
1760598724	1760598725	Premise: World leaders expressed concern on Thursday that North Korea will quit six-party nuclear disarmament talks and will  bolster its nuclear weapons arsenal.  Hypothesis: North Korea says it has a stockpile of nuclear weapons and is building more.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that world leaders expressed concern that North Korea will quit six-party nuclear disarmament talks and bolster its nuclear weapons arsenal. This implies that North Korea's actions (or lack thereof) are the cause of the concern among world leaders.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that North Korea has a stockpile of nuclear weapons and is building more. This is an assertion about North Korea's capabilities and intentions, which is not directly related to the premise. The premise does not provide any information about North Korea's current stockpile or intentions, only that world leaders are concerned about its potential actions.  To make the hypothesis follow from the premise, there would need to be a clear causal link between North Korea's actions (or lack thereof) and the concern among world leaders. The premise does not provide enough information to establish such a link, so the hypothesis is not necessarily a logical consequence of the premise.	197	
1760598725	1760598726	Premise: In addition to establishing the electoral commission, the laws also concern nationality, a contentious issue since citizenship laws were tightened to exclude one of Gbagbo's main competitors from the 2000 presidential race, former prime minister Alassane Ouattara.  Hypothesis: Gbagbo is a competitor of Ouattara.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that the laws were tightened to exclude one of Gbagbo's main competitors from the 2000 presidential race, and it specifically mentions former prime minister Alassane Ouattara. This implies that Ouattara was indeed a competitor of Gbagbo in the 2000 presidential race, and that the laws were enacted to prevent Ouattara from running. Therefore, the hypothesis that Gbagbo is a competitor of Ouattara is supported by the premise.	108	
1760598726	1760598727	Premise: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace Prize, though he was nominated for it five times between 1937 and 1948.  Hypothesis: Mohandas received the Nobel Prize in 1989.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that Mohandas Gandhi was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize five times between 1937 and 1948, but it does not state that he was ever awarded the prize. It only states that he was nominated.   Additionally, the premise does not provide any information about the Nobel Prize in 1989. The hypothesis suggests that Gandhi received the prize in 1989, but the premise only discusses his nominations between 1937 and 1948.  Therefore, there is no logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis, and the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.	132	
1760598727	1760598728	Premise: The Christian Democrats (CDU) won 35.2% of the vote, or 225 seats, against 34.3% for Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats (SPD).  Hypothesis: It seems unlikely that there will be a coalition between Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats and Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Christian Democrats (CDU) won 35.2% of the vote, or 225 seats, against 34.3% for the Social Democrats (SPD). This implies that the CDU won more seats than the SPD, which suggests a possible majority for the CDU.  Given this information, it is unlikely that there will be a coalition between the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats, as the CDU may be in a position to govern on its own.  However, the hypothesis suggests that there will not be a coalition between the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats, which is the opposite of what the premise implies. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.	158	
1760598728	1760598730	Premise: Edward VIII became King in January of 1936 and abdicated in December.  Hypothesis: King Edward VIII abdicated in December 1936.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Edward VIII became King in January 1936 and abdicated in December 1936. However, the hypothesis states that he abdicated in December 1936, which is the same month stated in the premise. The premise already provides a specific time frame for Edward VIII's abdication, and the hypothesis simply reiterates this information without adding any new information.  To make the hypothesis follow from the premise, it would need to include more specific information about the circumstances or details surrounding Edward VIII's abdication, such as the reason for his abdication or the outcome of his abdication. As it stands, the hypothesis is redundant and does not provide any new information.	158	
1760598730	1760598731	"Premise: Australian Guantanamo Bay detainee David Hicks has won British citizenship, opening the door for a possible bid to have him freed from the US detention facility in Cuba. Justice Lawrence Collins of the British High Court has overturned the British Government's refusal of citizenship to Hicks, whose mother was born in England. Justice Collins said the Government had ""no power to withhold or deprive citizenship"". Justice Collins said: ""In my view it would be improper to fail to give assistance which otherwise would have been given, simply because the claimant was believed to be involved in terrorism and has not had any previous connection with this country."" Hicks' lawyer, Stephen Grosz, said the decision was a breakthrough. He said there was now no reason why Hicks should not enjoy the same protection as the nine other British citizens released without charge from Guantanamo Bay on representations of the British Government.  Hypothesis: Stephen Grosz is the British lawyer of David Hicks.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that ""Justice Lawrence Collins of the British High Court has overturned the British Government's refusal of citizenship to Hicks, whose mother was born in England."" This implies that the person who made the decision was Justice Lawrence Collins, not Stephen Grosz.  The hypothesis states that Stephen Grosz is the British lawyer of David Hicks. While it is possible that Stephen Grosz is indeed Hicks' lawyer, the premise does not provide any information that directly links Grosz to Hicks or the decision made by Justice Collins. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Grosz is Hicks' lawyer based on the given information."	134	
1760598731	1760598732	Premise: Rockweed has been harvested commercially in Nova Scotia since the late 1950's and is currently the most important commercial seaweed in Atlantic Canada.  Hypothesis: Marine vegetation is  harvested.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Rockweed has been harvested commercially in Nova Scotia since the late 1950s and is currently the most important commercial seaweed in Atlantic Canada. This implies that Rockweed is a commercially valuable resource, but it does not directly state that marine vegetation is harvested.  The hypothesis ""Marine vegetation is harvested"" is too broad and makes a general claim about marine vegetation as a whole, whereas the premise only makes a specific claim about Rockweed. To make the hypothesis follow from the premise, it would need to be more specific and related to Rockweed, such as ""Rockweed is harvested commercially"" or ""Commercial harvesting of Rockweed is a significant industry in Nova Scotia"".  Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise."	165	
1760598732	1760598733	Premise: Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has ordered security forces to take firm action against rioters following the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto. The violence has left at least 44 people dead and dozens injured. Mr. Musharraf insisted the measures were to protect people. VOA's Ayaz Gul reports from Islamabad that a bitter dispute has also erupted over how the 54-year-old politician died and who was behind her assassination.  Hypothesis: Musharraf has ordered rioters to take firm action against security forces.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has ordered security forces to take firm action against rioters, but it does not mention anything about Musharraf ordering rioters to take action against security forces. The hypothesis is actually the opposite of what is stated in the premise, and therefore it does not logically follow.	78	
1760598733	1760598733	"Premise: A month after Gov. David A. Paterson dropped his proposal for a soda tax, New York City's health commissioner has written an article advocating ""hefty"" taxes on sodas and sports drinks containing sugar. Such a tax, the article said, could be the biggest boon to public health since tobacco taxes. The commissioner, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, and Kelly D. Brownell of Yale University, his co-author, argue in the New England Journal of Medicine that a tax of a penny per ounce could reduce consumption by more than 10 percent and raise $1.2 billion a year in New York State alone.  Hypothesis: Michael Bloomberg is the mayor of New York.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that New York City's health commissioner, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, wrote an article advocating for a soda tax. While it is likely that Dr. Frieden is a health commissioner in New York City, there is no evidence in the premise to suggest that Michael Bloomberg is the mayor of New York. Michael Bloomberg was the mayor of New York City from 2002 to 2013, but the premise does not provide any information about the current mayor or the current administration.	113	
1760598733	1760598734	Premise: Officials said the Finnish suspect was among the dead but did not provide a motive for the attack.  Hypothesis: Officials said that the suspect, a Finnish citizen, was among the dead.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that ""Officials said the Finnish suspect was among the dead,"" which implies that the suspect is indeed dead. However, the hypothesis states that ""the suspect, a Finnish citizen, was among the dead,"" which adds an additional assumption that the suspect is a citizen of Finland. The premise does not provide any information about the suspect's nationality, so we cannot conclude that the suspect is a Finnish citizen based on the premise."	99	
1760598734	1760598735	Premise: Britain agreed to lift by March 31 a 150-mile military protection zone enforced around the islands since Argentina invaded them in 1982.  Hypothesis: The military protection zone around Falklands was lifted.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.   The premise states that Britain agreed to lift a 150-mile military protection zone around the Falklands by March 31. The hypothesis states that the military protection zone was lifted. These two statements are directly related and logically connected, as the lifting of the protection zone is a direct consequence of Britain's agreement to do so. Therefore, the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise.	87	
1760598735	1760598736	"Premise: The ferry owner PT Nur Budi's spokesman blamed Indonesian port authorities for the tragedy. ""The passenger capacity of the ferry is 205 people but the port administrator accepted more passengers as they thought it was possible,"" he said. The National Meteorological and Geophysics Agency, however, had published and raised an alert signal about high waves on Friday. It specifically stated that ""Saturday 10th and Sunday 11th, Indonesian waters would have witnessed storm force waves,"" but despite the dire warnings KM Teratai set for the seas.  Hypothesis: An Indonesian ferry with 300 passengers sank.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the ferry had a passenger capacity of 205 people, but the port administrator accepted more passengers. However, it does not mention that the ferry actually set sail with 300 passengers. The premise only mentions that the port administrator accepted more passengers, but it does not state that the ferry actually carried 300 passengers.  Therefore, the hypothesis that the ferry sank with 300 passengers is not supported by the premise, as there is no information about the actual number of passengers on board.	113	
1760598736	1760598737	Premise: Tension and battles between Greek police and anarchist demonstrators took place in the centre of Athens, Greece, during the anti-war demonstration of the 4th European Social Forum which is taking place in the Greek capital, from 4 to 7 of May 2006. The march of the approximately 1,000 anarchists ended with clashes between groups of anarchists and police. Riot police used tear gas, while a branch of a Greek bank, a fast-food store and around 50 shop windows in central Athens were damaged.  Hypothesis: The riots in Greece started on December 6.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the anti-war demonstration of the 4th European Social Forum took place in the centre of Athens, Greece, from 4 to 7 May 2006. It does not mention anything about the riots in December.  The hypothesis, ""The riots in Greece started on December 6"", is not supported by any information in the premise. In fact, the premise suggests that the events described occurred in May 2006, not December 2005."	109	
1760598737	1760598738	Premise: Libya's case against Britain and the US concerns the dispute over their demand for extradition of Libyans charged with blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in 1988.  Hypothesis: One case involved the extradition of Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Libya's case against Britain and the US concerns the dispute over their demand for extradition of Libyans charged with blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in 1988. This sets up a clear context of a specific event and a dispute between Libya and the involved countries.  The hypothesis states that one case involved the extradition of Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing. This directly relates to the information provided in the premise, as the Lockerbie bombing is mentioned as the specific incident at the center of the dispute. The hypothesis is a specific claim about one of the cases in this dispute, which is implied by the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise.	153	
1760598738	1760598739	Premise: Argentina sought help from Britain on its privatization program and encouraged British investment.  Hypothesis: Argentina sought UK expertise on privatization and agriculture.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Argentina sought help from Britain on its privatization program and encouraged British investment. This implies that Argentina was looking for assistance with privatization, which could encompass a range of areas, including agriculture.  The hypothesis, however, is too specific, suggesting that Argentina sought UK expertise specifically on privatization and agriculture. While it is possible that Argentina may have sought expertise in agriculture, the premise does not provide any information about the specific areas of expertise or the focus of the assistance.  A more plausible hypothesis would be:  Hypothesis: Argentina sought UK expertise on privatization.  This hypothesis is a more general and reasonable inference from the premise, as privatization is a broader concept that could encompass various areas, including agriculture.	162	
1760598739	1760598740	Premise: Instead of action on crime, we got the federal long gun registry, which became a bloated bureaucratic nightmare to responsible hunters, farmers and rural Canadians. It cost taxpayers some CA$2 billion and it hasn't done a thing to reduce gun crime. said Harper. The Conservatives have provided amnesty for unregistered gun owners. At this time there is no legislation set before the House of Commons. Conservative Garry Breitkreuz from Saskatchewan tabled the bill killing the long-gun registry.  Hypothesis: Garry Breitkreuz is a member of the Conservative Party.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  Here's why:  1. The premise states that the Conservative Party is responsible for introducing the federal long gun registry, which became a bureaucratic nightmare. 2. The premise also mentions that the Conservatives have provided amnesty for unregistered gun owners and that Conservative Garry Breitkreuz from Saskatchewan tabled a bill to kill the long-gun registry. 3. Given that the premise attributes these actions to the Conservative Party, it is reasonable to infer that Garry Breitkreuz is a member of the Conservative Party.  This is an example of deductive reasoning, where a specific detail (Garry Breitkreuz tabled the bill to kill the long-gun registry) is linked to a general category (the Conservative Party), and the hypothesis is drawn from the premise.	169	
1760598740	1760598742	Premise: The researchers in the latest study fed one group of mice a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat. The diet started when the mice, all males, were 1 year old, which is middle-age in mouse longevity. As expected, the mice soon developed signs of impending diabetes, with grossly enlarged livers, and started to die much sooner than mice fed a standard diet.  Hypothesis: At the age of one year, male mice were fed with a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the mice were fed a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat, but it does not state that the mice were fed this diet at the age of one year. The hypothesis assumes that the mice were fed this diet at the age of one year, but this is not explicitly stated in the premise.  The premise only mentions the composition of the diet, but not the age at which the mice were fed it. Therefore, the hypothesis is not a direct consequence of the premise, and additional information is needed to establish the connection between the diet and the observed effects on the mice.	136	
1760598742	1760598742	Premise: The soldiers, who were said to have been wearing Arab headdress, were accused of firing at Iraqi police when stopped at a road block.  Hypothesis: The soldiers were driving a civilian car and were dressed in civilian clothes when a shooting took place between them and Iraqi patrols.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the soldiers were wearing Arab headdress, which implies that they were indeed soldiers. However, the hypothesis states that they were actually driving a civilian car and dressed in civilian clothes. These two statements are mutually exclusive, as soldiers typically do not wear civilian clothes, and it is unlikely that they would be wearing an Arab headdress if they were not soldiers.  Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically deduced from the premise, as the premise provides information that contradicts the hypothesis.	112	
1760598742	1760598744	"Premise: The United States would like to see U.N. weapons inspectors return to Iraq providing the Iraqis take concrete, affirmative and demonstrable actions ""to show full co-operation"" Clinton said.  Hypothesis: U.N. weapons inspectors could stay in Iraq, Clinton said.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the United States wants U.N. weapons inspectors to return to Iraq, but only if the Iraqis take concrete, affirmative, and demonstrable actions ""to show full cooperation"". This implies that the inspectors' presence is contingent upon the Iraqis' actions.  The hypothesis, however, states that U.N. weapons inspectors could stay in Iraq, which is a more general statement that doesn't take into account the condition specified in the premise. The hypothesis doesn't mention anything about the Iraqis' actions or cooperation, so it doesn't logically follow from the premise.  In other words, the premise sets a condition (Iraq's cooperation) that must be met before the inspectors can stay, but the hypothesis doesn't account for this condition, making it a separate and distinct claim."	173	
1760598744	1760598745	Premise: On 12 August, the San Carlos Battalion came across mines placed in their path and one soldier was killed while two were seriously injured. Meanwhile on 10 August, urban commandos took a patrol car by surprise and dropped a grenade inside the car, injuring four and partially destroying the vehicle.  Hypothesis: A patrol car was attacked by the San Carlos Battalion.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that the San Carlos Battalion came across mines and one soldier was killed and two were seriously injured. It does not mention anything about a patrol car being attacked. The second event described is about urban commandos taking a patrol car by surprise and dropping a grenade inside it, which is a separate incident.   Therefore, the hypothesis that a patrol car was attacked by the San Carlos Battalion is not supported by the given premise.	99	
1760598745	1760598746	Premise: Bomb-sniffing dogs were brought to Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment.  Hypothesis: Bomb-sniffing dogs were estimated at Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that bomb-sniffing dogs were brought to Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment. This suggests that the dogs were located at the apartment, but it does not provide any information about their role or function.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that bomb-sniffing dogs were estimated at Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment. The word ""estimated"" implies that the presence of bomb-sniffing dogs was measured or quantified in some way, which is not indicated by the premise.  Therefore, the hypothesis makes an assumption that is not supported by the premise, and it does not logically follow from it."	141	
1760598746	1760598748	Premise: Startling new research into mobile phones claims they may reduce a man's sperm count by up to 30%.  Hypothesis: Male fertility may be affected by use of a mobile phones.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that ""new research"" claims that mobile phones may reduce a man's sperm count by up to 30%. However, the premise does not provide any information about the relationship between mobile phones and male fertility. It only mentions that there is a claim about a possible link between mobile phone use and reduced sperm count.  A hypothesis should be a testable and falsifiable statement that explains the relationship between the variables. In this case, the premise does not provide enough information to create a testable hypothesis.  To create a testable hypothesis, we would need more information about the nature of the research, such as:  * What is the mechanism by which mobile phones are supposed to affect sperm count? * What is the population being studied (e.g. healthy men, men with infertility issues, etc.)? * What is the control group being used for comparison? * What is the expected direction of the relationship (e.g. do mobile phones decrease sperm count, or increase it)?  Without this additional information, the premise does not provide enough context to create a testable hypothesis."	233	
1760598748	1760598749	Premise: Workers at the Lufthansa Technik Automotive plant in Co Dublin are due to vote today on changes to work practices being sought by the company's management. The aircraft engine maintenace firm has warned that rejection of the proposals would threaten a planned €17230m investment in the Rathcoole plant and put jobs at risk. LTA says it is not seeking any lay-offs or pay cuts and the planned investment would guarantee the future of the plant for the next 15 years. The work-practice changes are being sought following the collapse of Labour Relations Commission talks on the matter.  Hypothesis: Lufthansa Technik Automotive fires 30 workers.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Lufthansa Technik Automotive has warned that rejection of the proposed work practices changes would threaten a planned €17,230m investment in the Rathcoole plant and put jobs at risk. However, it also states that LTA is not seeking any lay-offs or pay cuts.  This means that the planned investment is contingent on the workers accepting the proposed changes, but it does not imply that the company is planning to fire 30 workers if the changes are rejected. The premise does not provide any information about the consequences of rejecting the proposals, only the consequences of accepting them.  Therefore, the hypothesis that Lufthansa Technik Automotive fires 30 workers if the workers reject the proposals is not a logical consequence of the premise.	166	
1760598749	1760598750	Premise: It rewrites the rules of global trade, established by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, in 1947, and modified in multiple rounds of negotiations since then.  Hypothesis: GATT was formed in 1947.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was ""rewritten"" by a new agreement, but it does not mention anything about the year it was formed. The hypothesis claims that GATT was formed in 1947, which is not supported by the premise.  The correct interpretation of the premise is that GATT was modified in multiple rounds of negotiations since its original establishment, but the year of its formation is not specified. Therefore, the hypothesis is not a logical consequence of the premise."	119	
1760598750	1760598751	Premise: Vice President Dick Cheney on Tuesday hurled an obscenity on the Senate floor to punctuate an angry exchange with Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy as all senators gathered for their annual photo.  Hypothesis: Cheney cursed at Sen. Patrick Leahy.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Vice President Dick Cheney hurled an obscenity on the Senate floor during an exchange with Sen. Patrick Leahy, but it does not specify that the obscenity was directed at Sen. Leahy. The hypothesis assumes a specific target for the obscenity, whereas the premise leaves it open to interpretation. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis follows from the premise.	90	
1760598751	1760598751	Premise: In the May 2005 general election Michael Howard failed to unseat the Labour Government, although the Conservatives did gain 33 seats, playing the most significant role in reducing Labour's majority from 167 to 66.  Hypothesis: In the May 2005 general election Conservatives got 33 seats.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Conservatives gained 33 seats, which is the actual outcome of the May 2005 general election. However, the hypothesis claims that the Conservatives got 33 seats, which is a specific detail that is already stated in the premise.   In other words, the premise already tells us that the Conservatives gained 33 seats, so the hypothesis is redundant and does not provide any new information.	95	
1760598751	1760598752	Premise: The Norwegian Newspaper Corpus is a large and self-expanding corpus of Norwegian newspaper texts. The collection of this dynamic and continually growing corpus began in 1998.  Hypothesis: Dagbladet is a Norwegian newspaper.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Norwegian Newspaper Corpus is a large and self-expanding corpus of Norwegian newspaper texts, and that the collection began in 1998. This premise does not provide any information about the specific newspaper that the corpus contains, or which one is being referred to. Therefore, it is not possible to infer that Dagbladet is the specific newspaper in the corpus.  In fact, the premise is quite general and could refer to any Norwegian newspaper, not just Dagbladet. To make a hypothesis about the specific newspaper, additional information would be needed.	128	1.0
1760598752	1760598754	Premise: The Dutch, who ruled Indonesia until 1949, called the city of Jakarta Batavia.  Hypothesis: Formerly ( until 1949 ) Batavia, Jakarta is largest city and capital of Indonesia.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Dutch ruled Indonesia until 1949 and that they called the city of Jakarta ""Batavia"". However, this does not necessarily imply that Batavia was the largest city and capital of Indonesia.  The premise only provides information about the historical name of the city (Batavia) and the fact that it was ruled by the Dutch. It does not provide any information about the city's size or its status as the capital of Indonesia.  In fact, the city of Jakarta was already the capital of Indonesia from 1949 onwards, even after the Dutch left. The name ""Jakarta"" was already in use during the Dutch colonial period, but it was not the official name. The Dutch referred to the city as Batavia, while the locals and the Indonesian government used the name Jakarta.  Therefore, the hypothesis that Batavia is the largest city and capital of Indonesia does not logically follow from the premise."	200	
1760598754	1760598755	"Premise: The name for the newest James Bond film has been announced today. The 22nd film, previously known only as ""Bond 22"", will be called ""Quantum of Solace"". EON Productions who are producing the film made the announcement today at Pinewood Studios, where production for the film has been under way since last year. The name of the film was inspired by a short story (of the same name) from For Your Eyes Only by Bond creator, Ian Fleming.  Hypothesis: James Bond was created by Ian Fleming.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that the name for the newest James Bond film, ""Quantum of Solace"", was inspired by a short story of the same name from For Your Eyes Only, which was written by Ian Fleming. This directly implies that Ian Fleming was the creator of the James Bond series, as he is credited with writing the original Bond stories.   Therefore, the hypothesis ""James Bond was created by Ian Fleming"" can be logically inferred from the premise."	102	
1760598755	1760598756	Premise: The gastric bypass operation, also known as stomach stapling, has become the most common surgical procedure for treating obesity.  Hypothesis: Obesity is medically treated.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the gastric bypass operation, also known as stomach stapling, is the most common surgical procedure for treating obesity. However, this premise does not imply that obesity is medically treated. In fact, the premise only mentions that a specific surgical procedure is commonly used to treat obesity, but it does not address the underlying medical treatment of obesity itself.  The hypothesis ""Obesity is medically treated"" is a more general statement that should be supported by evidence from various medical interventions and treatments beyond just gastric bypass surgery. The premise only provides information about a specific surgical procedure, but does not provide any information about the broader scope of medical treatments for obesity.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise."	156	
1760598756	1760598757	Premise: The cost of the consumer of the United States fell in June.  Hypothesis: U.S. consumer spending dived in June.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the cost of consumers in the United States fell in June. However, this statement only talks about the cost of consumers, not their spending. In fact, it's possible that the cost of consumers (i.e., the cost of living or expenses) decreased, but their spending (i.e., actual purchases or expenditures) may have increased or remained the same.  To support the hypothesis, we would need more information about the relationship between the cost of consumers and their spending. For example, if the cost of consumers fell, it's possible that they reduced their spending to offset the decrease in their own costs, or they may have continued to spend the same amount despite the decrease in their own costs.	157	
1760598757	1760598758	"Premise: The former leader of Iraq was rushed to hospital last Sunday after refusing to eat for sixteen days. But according to news agencies, he has ended the hunger strike by eating lunch at the court in Baghdad. ""Saddam ate beef and rice and cola with bread which he brought from hospital,"" one source told Reuters news agency. He was fasting with three co-defendants, and they were demanding more security for their defence lawyers, three of whom have been murdered.  Hypothesis: Some Australians have fasted to protest.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the former leader of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, was rushed to the hospital after refusing to eat for sixteen days, and that he ended the hunger strike by eating lunch at the court in Baghdad. This information is specific to Saddam Hussein and his hunger strike.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that some Australians have fasted to protest. There is no connection between Saddam Hussein's hunger strike and Australians fasting to protest, so the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.	113	
1760598758	1760598759	Premise: Sonia Gandhi can be defeated in the next elections in India by BJP.  Hypothesis: Sonia Gandhi is defeated by BJP.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.  The premise states that Sonia Gandhi can be defeated in the next elections in India by the BJP, but it does not specify that Sonia Gandhi will be the one to be defeated. The premise only mentions that the BJP has the capability to defeat Sonia Gandhi, not that Sonia Gandhi herself will be the one to lose.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, specifically states that Sonia Gandhi is the one who will be defeated by the BJP. This is an unwarranted assumption that is not supported by the premise.  A more accurate hypothesis that follows from the premise would be:  Hypothesis: The BJP has the capability to defeat Sonia Gandhi in the next elections in India.  This hypothesis is a more direct and logical conclusion based on the premise.	165	
1760598759	1760598761	Premise: Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has said that Mahmoud Abbas is a man that Israel can do business with.  Hypothesis: Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, may be someone Israel can talk with.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has said that Mahmoud Abbas is a man that Israel can do business with. This implies that Sharon's statement is a statement about Abbas' character or his potential as a partner for negotiations.  However, the hypothesis is a statement about Abbas' potential as a partner for negotiations in general, without any reference to Sharon's personal opinion or endorsement. Therefore, the hypothesis is not logically connected to the premise, and we cannot conclude that Abbas is someone Israel can talk with based on Sharon's statement.  In other words, Sharon's statement is a specific endorsement of Abbas as a potential partner, but the hypothesis is a more general claim about Abbas' potential as a partner. The premise does not provide sufficient information to support the hypothesis.	167	
1760598761	1760598761	Premise: The Tempe Hometown Premiere will have all the trappings of a mega-Hollywood  event including red carpet arrivals, klieg lights, screaming fans, paparazzi and  media coverage of the film`s stars headed by Wolverine himself, Hugh Jackman and  including Liev Schreiber, Ryan Reynolds, Taylor Kitsch, Lynn Collins, will.i.am  and director Gavin Hood.  Following a hard-fought contest stretching over thousands of cities and towns  across the United States, Tempe emerged triumphant in a far-reaching, citywide  bid to nab the gala event. Mayor Hugh Hallman himself rallied the community,  which stepped up with dozens of videos that were posted on YouTube.  Hypothesis: Hugh Jackman plays the role of Wolverine in the movie.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise mentions that Hugh Jackman is one of the stars attending the Tempe Hometown Premiere, but it does not state that he plays the role of Wolverine in the movie. The hypothesis assumes that Hugh Jackman is the actor playing Wolverine, which is not explicitly stated in the premise.	71	
1760598761	1760598763	Premise: In October, however, amid rising tensions between the government and opposition groups, a car bomb seriously injured an opposition politician and killed his driver, in Beirut.  Hypothesis: A member of the opposition was injured in a car bomb attack in Beirut.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  Here's why:  * The premise states that there are rising tensions between the government and opposition groups. * It then mentions a car bomb attack in Beirut, which is a violent and destructive incident that can be associated with such tensions. * The attack resulted in serious injury to an opposition politician and the death of his driver, which is a direct consequence of the attack. * The phrase ""in October"" is a temporal indicator, but it doesn't change the fact that the incident occurred in Beirut, which is where the opposition politician was injured.  Therefore, the hypothesis that a member of the opposition was injured in a car bomb attack in Beirut logically follows from the premise. The information in the premise sets the stage for the incident, and the details of the incident itself provide the evidence that supports the hypothesis."	173	
1760598763	1760598764	Premise: Weinstock painstakingly reviewed dozens of studies for evidence of any link between sunscreen use and either an increase or decrease in melanoma.  Hypothesis: skin cancer numbers increase.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Weinstock ""painstakingly reviewed dozens of studies"" for evidence of a link between sunscreen use and skin cancer, which implies that the premise is focused on the process of investigation and review, rather than a conclusion about the outcome. The premise does not provide any information about the results of the studies or any conclusions drawn from them.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a specific claim about the relationship between sunscreen use and skin cancer numbers. To support the hypothesis, evidence from the studies would be needed. The premise does not provide any evidence or indication that the hypothesis is supported by the studies, so the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise."	150	
1760598764	1760598765	Premise: Most people are familiar with the idea of St. Bernards or other dogs taking part in rescue and recovery efforts. Robots might also take part in search and rescue missions.  Hypothesis: Robots are used to find missing victims.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.   The premise states that most people are familiar with St. Bernards or other dogs taking part in rescue and recovery efforts. This implies that dogs are commonly used for search and rescue missions, but it does not necessarily imply that robots are used for this purpose.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that robots are used to find missing victims, which introduces a specific technology (robots) that is not mentioned in the premise. The premise only mentions dogs, not robots. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.	120	
1760598765	1760598766	Premise: Illinois born Charlton Heston was a 27-year-old actor from Broadway and television when he arrived in Hollywood for a five-picture contract with Hal Wallis.  Hypothesis: Charlton Heston was born in Illinois.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Charlton Heston was born in Illinois and was 27 years old when he arrived in Hollywood. However, it does not explicitly state that he was born in Illinois. It only states that he was from Illinois, which could refer to his place of origin, his place of residence, or his state of birth.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, makes a specific claim about Charlton Heston's birthplace, stating that he was born in Illinois. This claim is not explicitly supported by the premise, and therefore, it does not logically follow from it.	133	
1760598766	1760598768	Premise: Ruth's 1927 single season record of 60 home runs stood unsurpassed until Roger Maris hit 61 in 1961.  Hypothesis: Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs in his lifetime.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Ruth's 1927 single season record of 60 home runs stood unsurpassed until Roger Maris hit 61 in 1961. This implies that Ruth's record of 60 home runs was broken only once, by Roger Maris, and that Maris's record-breaking home run was a singular achievement.  However, the hypothesis states that Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs in his lifetime, which is not necessarily supported by the premise. The premise does not provide information about Ruth's total lifetime home runs, only his 1927 record. It is possible that Ruth hit more than 60 home runs in his lifetime, but the premise does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis.  To follow from the premise, additional information would be needed, such as the total number of home runs Ruth hit in his career, or some statement that his 1927 record was his only achievement. As it stands, the premise does not provide enough information to support the hypothesis.	214	
1760598768	1760598769	Premise: The German technology was employed to build Shanghai's existing maglev line, the first in the world to be used commercially.  Hypothesis: Maglev is commercially used.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the German technology was employed to build Shanghai's existing maglev line, but it does not state that the Shanghai maglev line is commercially used. The premise only provides information about the construction of the line, not its current usage.  To make the hypothesis follow from the premise, it would need to be rephrased to include information about the commercial usage of the Shanghai maglev line. For example:  Hypothesis: The Shanghai maglev line is commercially used.  This revised hypothesis follows from the premise because it specifies that the line was built using German technology, which implies that it is likely to be in operation and being used for commercial purposes.	150	
1760598769	1760598769	"Premise: SEATTLE — United Nations gang leader Clay Roueche should spend at least 30 years behind bars after his surprise guilty plea here Tuesday for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine, marijuana and illicit drug profits, U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Sullivan said. Sullivan said outside court that Roueche's leadership of the violent UN gang and the sophistication of the international drug conspiracy will all be factors used to argue for a longer sentence — up to life — for the 33-year-old Canadian. And he stressed that the plea agreement reached with Roueche did not include ""any kind of break with respect to sentencing."".  Hypothesis: Clay Roueche is 33 years old.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that Clay Roueche is a 33-year-old Canadian, but it does not provide any information about his age. The hypothesis, on the other hand, explicitly states that Clay Roueche is 33 years old. The premise only provides the age as one of several characteristics of Roueche, but it does not imply that the age is a fact that must be true.	92	
1760598769	1760598771	"Premise: Baker's voice will replace the earlier computer-synthesized voice that was previously used. BT said that his voice was chosen as it was instantly recognisable. It took him 11 days to record 11,593 phrases and sounds which could then be broken down and reassembled by a computer to make new words. It then took five months to process these recordings to make a workable service. BT have said that there will be no barriers as to what Tom Baker's voice can 'say', including rude words. ""What appeals to me most is the thought that I will be bringing good news to people whether it is a cheeky message, a birthday greeting, or just a quick hello,"" said Baker.  Hypothesis: Tom Baker works for BT.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"Yes, the hypothesis ""Tom Baker works for BT"" follows from the premise.  The premise states that Tom Baker's voice was chosen by BT because it is instantly recognizable, and he recorded 11,593 phrases and sounds to create a new voice service. The fact that the service is called ""BT"" and that Tom Baker's voice is being used to create it suggests a strong connection between Tom Baker and the company.  Additionally, the tone of the statement from Tom Baker himself further supports this hypothesis. He mentions that he will be bringing ""good news"" to people through the service, which is consistent with a company's goal of providing customer service or communication. The mention of birthday greetings and quick hellos also implies that the service is designed to interact with customers, which is typical of a company like BT.  Overall, the evidence presented in the premise and the statement from Tom Baker strongly suggests that he is an employee of BT, and therefore, the hypothesis is well-supported."	199	
1760598771	1760598772	Premise: The Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for the selection of the candidates and the choice of Prize Winners for the Peace Prize. The Committee is composed of five members appointed by the Storting (Norwegian parliament). The Peace Prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway and not in Stockholm, Sweden like the other Nobel Prizes.  Hypothesis: Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for the selection of the candidates and the choice of Prize Winners for the Peace Prize, and that the Committee is composed of five members appointed by the Storting (Norwegian parliament). However, it does not provide any information about the actual selection process, the frequency of the award, or the fact that Nobel Peace Prize winners are chosen.  The hypothesis ""Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen"" is a separate statement that can be true or false, and it is not logically connected to the premise. The premise only talks about the structure and composition of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, but it does not provide any information about the actual selection process or the outcome of the Nobel Peace Prize awards.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise."	173	
1760598772	1760598774	Premise: More than 150 dolphins, marine turtles and beaked whales have been washed up dead on beaches in Africa.  Hypothesis: Dead dolphins, turtles and whales have been found on African beaches.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that more than 150 dolphins, marine turtles, and beaked whales have been washed up dead on beaches in Africa. This information provides specific details about the location (Africa) and the species (dolphins, turtles, and beaked whales) affected.  However, the hypothesis is a general statement that simply states that dead dolphins, turtles, and whales have been found on African beaches. It lacks specific details about the number of animals, the location, and the circumstances surrounding their deaths.  The premise provides more information about the scope and scale of the incident, but it does not provide enough information to conclude that the hypothesis is true. Therefore, the hypothesis is not necessarily a logical conclusion based on the premise.	159
