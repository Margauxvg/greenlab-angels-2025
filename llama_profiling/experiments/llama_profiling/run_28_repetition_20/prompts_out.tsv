The action of covering the cash is intended to deceive or mislead someone, not to protect or shield anything.

Here, "voice" is used to describe the various individuals, groups, or organizations that express conservative views. The word "many voices" suggests a multiplicity of viewpoints, rather than a single authoritative expression.

In this context, it is related to the natural phenomenon of the seasons or the year, where the same pattern of seasons repeats itself every year. This is an example of a regular or periodic cycle.  In Sentence 2, however, "cycle" is used to describe a situation that is repetitive and has no end, implying a never-ending or perpetual nature. This is often used to convey a sense of a situation that is self-sustaining or has no clear termination point.  So, while both sentences use the word "cycle," they have different connotations and implications.

In this case, the drawer is the object that is moving, and the action of "rolling" is describing its movement.

In Sentence 2, "Stand up for yourself-don't be such a baby!" means to be brave and assertive, and not to act in a childish or weak manner. In this context, "baby" is being used as an insult, implying that the person is acting like a child who is unable to take care of themselves or make decisions.

Sentence 2: My business closes every night at 8 P.M.  Explain your choice.	Yes, the word "close" has the same meaning in both sentences.  In Sentence 1, "to close the factory" means to stop operating the factory and bring it to a halt, effectively ending its operation.

In the second sentence, the word "connection" is used in a more neutral or objective sense, suggesting a physical or medical connection between the headache and the event. This is an example of a "causal connection", where the headache is seen as a result of going out last night.
