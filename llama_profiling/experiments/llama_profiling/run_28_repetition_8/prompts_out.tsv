This usage of ""fell"" is more idiomatic and often used to describe a sudden and intense emotional event, such as grief, shock, or disappointment.  So, while the word ""fall"" is used in both sentences, the verb form and its meaning are different in each sentence."	190	
1760553598	1760553599	"Does the word ""finish"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: The boat had a metallic finish. Sentence 2: He applied a coat of a clear finish.

1760553629	1760553630	"Does the word ""subvert"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: Do school counselors subvert young children?

For example, ""The statue stood on the corner"" means that the statue was in a fixed position on the corner, not that it was standing in the sense of being upright.
