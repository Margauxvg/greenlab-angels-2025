In this case, the word ""makes"" (a plural verb form) is used to describe the third infraction, indicating that it is the cause or result of something else (perhaps a rule or a policy).  The key difference is the grammatical form and the context in which ""make"" is used. In Sentence 1, it's a singular verb, while in Sentence 2, it's a plural verb (makes) used as a linking verb to connect the subject (the infraction) to a predicate (the cause or result)."	206

Sentence 2: My business closes every night at 8 P.M.  Explain your choice."	"No, the word ""close"" does not have the same meaning in the two sentences.

This is an idiomatic expression, where ""fall"" is used figuratively to mean ""occur"" or ""happen.""

In Sentence 2, ""land you in jail"" means to put someone in a prison or a place of confinement, often as a result of a crime or wrongdoing.  The difference in meaning is due to the context and the word ""in"" in the second sentence, which indicates the location (jail) where someone will be placed."	137
1760460455	1760460456	"Does the word ""rake"" have the same meaning in the following two sentences?  Sentence 1: Rake gravel. Sentence 2: The gunfire raked the coast.  Explain your choice."	"No, the word ""rake"" does not have the same meaning in the two sentences.  In Sentence 1, ""rake"" is a verb meaning to gather or collect leaves, grass, or other materials with a rake tool. It is a transitive verb, meaning it requires an object (the gravel).  In Sentence 2, ""raked"" is a verb in the past tense of the verb ""rake"". It means to move or sweep something (the coast) with a rake tool, but in this case, it's likely referring to the sound of gunfire hitting the coast. The word ""raked"" is an intransitive verb, meaning it does not require an object.  So, in Sentence 1, the word ""rake"" is a tool used for a specific action, while in Sentence 2, the word ""raked"" describes an action caused by the gunfire."	188

Sentence 2: The image of f(x) = x^2 is the set of all non-negative real numbers if the domain of the function is the set of all real numbers.  Explain your choice."	"No, the word ""image"" has different meanings in the two sentences.  In Sentence 1, ""the image of 3 under f"" refers to the output or result of applying the function f(x) = 2*x to the input x = 3. In this context, ""image"" means the result of the function evaluation.  In Sentence 2, ""the image of f(x) = x^2"" refers to the set of all possible outputs of the function f(x) = x^2, which is the set of all non-negative real numbers.

In Sentence 1, ""He could tell that she was unhappy"" is an example of an idiomatic expression ""tell"" meaning ""to perceive or infer"". Here, ""tell"" is used to indicate that the speaker can sense or deduce that the person is unhappy, often through nonverbal cues or subtle behavior.  In Sentence 2, ""She told him how he did it"" is a literal meaning of the word ""tell"", which means to communicate or share information. In this case, ""told"" is a verb indicating that the person is sharing or revealing something.  So, while both sentences use the word ""tell"", they use it in different contexts with distinct meanings."	161
