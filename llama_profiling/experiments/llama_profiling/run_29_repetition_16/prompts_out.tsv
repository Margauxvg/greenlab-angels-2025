1760492830	1760492831	"Mark told Pete many lies about himself, which Pete included in his book. He should have been more skeptical.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Mark""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""He"" refers to ""Mark"".   This can be inferred because the sentence states ""Mark told Pete many lies about himself"". The pronoun ""he"" is in the subject position, referring back to the subject ""Mark"" mentioned in the previous clause. This is an example of a pronoun reference, where a pronoun (in this case ""he"") refers back to a noun (in this case ""Mark"") that was mentioned earlier in the sentence."	96
1760492831	1760492832	"The mothers of Arthur and Celeste have come to the town to fetch them. They are very happy to have them back, but they scold them just the same because they ran away.  In the sentence above, does ""them"" refer to ""mothers""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, in the sentence ""The mothers of Arthur and Celeste have come to the town to fetch them. They are very happy to have them back, but they scold them just the same because they ran away,"" ""them"" refers to ""Arthur and Celeste"".  This is because ""them"" is a pronoun that refers back to the subject of the previous clause, which is ""Arthur and Celeste"". In this context, ""them"" is used to refer to the two children, rather than the mothers. The phrase ""The mothers of Arthur and Celeste"" is a prepositional phrase that provides more information about who the mothers are, but it doesn't change the pronoun ""them"" that follows."	148
1760492832	1760492833	"Mark was close to Mr. Singer 's heels. He heard him calling for the captain, promising him, in the jargon everyone talked that night, that not one thing should be damaged on the ship except only the ammunition, but the captain and all his crew had best stay in the cabin until the work was over  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Mr. Singer""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""He"" does not refer to ""Mr. Singer"".   The pronoun ""He"" is used to refer to ""Mark"" in the sentence. The sentence states ""Mark was close to Mr. Singer's heels"", indicating that Mark is standing near Mr. Singer. The phrase ""promising him"" further emphasizes that the person Mark is referring to is Mr. Singer."	79
1760492833	1760492834	"The pony behaved well, sir, and showed no vice; but at last he just threw up his heels and tipped the young gentleman into the thorn hedge. He wanted me to help him out, but I hope you will excuse me, sir, I did not feel inclined to do so.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""young gentleman""? Explain your choice."	"In this sentence, ""he"" is likely referring to the pony, not the ""young gentleman"".   The context suggests that the pony is the one that threw the young gentleman into the thorn hedge. The phrase ""He wanted me to help him out"" implies that the pony, which is the subject of the previous action, is now in need of help, and the speaker is being asked to assist it. The use of the pronoun ""he"" to refer to the pony is a common way to use a pronoun to refer to an animal, especially in informal or old-fashioned writing.  The ""young gentleman"" is more likely the one who was thrown into the hedge, and is being referred to as ""he"" in the sentence ""He wanted me to help him out""."	160
1760492834	1760492835	"I poured water from the bottle into the cup until it was full.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""the cup""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""it"" is a pronoun that is used to refer to ""the cup"". This is because, in the context of the sentence, the cup is the object being described and acted upon (i.e., having water poured into it).   In this case, ""it"" is a reflexive pronoun, which is used to refer back to the same noun it is describing. The word ""it"" is the object of the preposition ""into"", and it is clearly referring back to the cup."	107
1760492835	1760492836	"Dan had to stop Bill from toying with the injured bird. He is very compassionate.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Dan""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""He"" in the sentence refers to ""Dan"".   The pronoun ""He"" is a male singular subject pronoun, and in this context, it agrees with the subject ""Dan"" because Dan is a male noun."	49
1760492836	1760492837	"Sam Goodman 's biography of the Spartan general Xenophanes conveys a vivid sense of the difficulties he faced in his childhood.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Goodman""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, in the sentence, ""he"" refers to ""Xenophanes"".   The reason is that the sentence is structured as a subject-verb agreement, where ""Sam Goodman"" is the subject of the sentence, performing the action described by the verb ""conveys"". The pronoun ""he"" is then used to refer back to the subject of the sentence, which is ""Xenophanes"", the object of the verb ""conveys"". This is an example of a pronoun reference back to the subject, where the pronoun ""he"" replaces the noun ""Xenophanes"" to make the sentence more concise and easier to read."	134
1760492837	1760492838	"Pam's parents came home and found her having sex with her boyfriend, Paul. They were furious about it.  In the sentence above, does ""They"" refer to ""Pam's parents""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""They"" is used to refer to ""Pam's parents"". The reason for this is that ""They"" is a plural pronoun, and it agrees with the subject ""Pam's parents"", which is also plural. The phrase ""Pam's parents"" is a possessive noun phrase, where ""Pam's"" is a possessive adjective modifying the noun ""parents"". The use of ""They"" here is a subject pronoun that corresponds to the plural noun ""parents""."	104
1760492838	1760492838	"Bob paid for Charlie 's college education, but now Charlie acts as though it never happened. He is very hurt.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Bob""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""He"" refers to ""Charlie"".   The reason for this is that the sentence starts with ""Charlie"", which is the subject of the sentence. The pronoun ""he"" is used to refer back to the subject ""Charlie"" in the previous clause, indicating that Charlie is the one who is acting hurt. This is an example of a pronoun reference, where the pronoun ""he"" serves as a pronoun that refers back to a noun (in this case, ""Charlie"") that was previously mentioned in the sentence."	112
1760492838	1760492839	"Billy cried because Toby wouldn't share his toy.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Toby""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""his"" refers to ""Toby"". The reason is that ""his"" is a possessive adjective, which shows that the toy belongs to Toby. In this context, ""his"" indicates that the toy is Toby's property, and the speaker is expressing that Toby refused to share it with someone else."	65
1760492839	1760492840	"Emma did not pass the ball to Janie although she was open.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Janie""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""she"" does not refer to ""Janie"" in the given sentence.  The pronoun ""she"" is a subject pronoun, which refers to the person performing the action in the sentence. In this case, the action is ""did not pass the ball to Janie,"" so ""she"" must refer to Emma, the person performing the action.  The subject of the sentence is ""Emma,"" and ""she"" is the subject pronoun that agrees with it. The phrase ""although she was open"" is a subordinate clause that provides additional information about Emma, but it does not change the fact that ""she"" refers to Emma, not Janie."	138
1760492840	1760492841	"Sam's drawing was hung just above Tina's and it did look much better with another one below it.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""Sam's drawing""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""it"" is likely referring to ""Sam's drawing"" because of the context. The sentence states that Sam's drawing was hung above Tina's, and then it mentions that it looked much better with another one below it. This implies that the ""it"" in question is the drawing that was initially hung above Tina's drawing. The use of ""it"" is also consistent with the subject-verb agreement, as ""it"" is a singular pronoun referring to a single noun (Sam's drawing)."	106
1760492841	1760492842	"Bob paid for Charlie 's college education, but now Charlie acts as though it never happened. He is very ungrateful.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Bob""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""He"" refers to ""Bob"" in the sentence.   The reason is that ""He"" is a pronoun that takes the subject of the sentence, which is ""Charlie"". In this context, ""He"" is used to refer to Charlie as the subject of the sentence, emphasizing his actions (or lack thereof)."	68
1760492842	1760492842	"The lawyer asked the witness a question, but he was reluctant to answer it.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""the lawyer""? Explain your choice."	"In this sentence, ""he"" is more likely to refer to the witness, rather than the lawyer. This is because the sentence states that the lawyer ""asked the witness a question"", which implies that the lawyer is the one doing the asking. This creates a contrast between the lawyer's action (asking the question) and the witness's reluctance (not wanting to answer), which makes it more likely that ""he"" refers to the witness."	90
1760492842	1760492843	"Sam took French classes from Adam , because he was eager to speak it fluently.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Sam""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""he"" refers to ""Sam"".   The pronoun ""he"" is a subject pronoun, and it typically refers to the subject of the sentence. In this case, the subject of the sentence is ""Sam"", which is performing the action of taking French classes.   The pronoun ""he"" agrees with the subject ""Sam"" in number (singular) and person (first person), which is why it refers to ""Sam""."	92
1760492843	1760492844	"Sid explained his theory to Mark but he couldn't convince him.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Mark""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""he"" refers to ""Sid"".   This is because the sentence is in the past tense, indicating a completed action or event (""Sid explained his theory to Mark""). The use of ""he"" in this context is a subject pronoun referring back to ""Sid"", who is the one performing the action of explaining his theory."	71
1760492844	1760492844	"The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence.  In the sentence above, does ""they"" refer to ""The demonstrators""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, in the sentence, ""they"" refers to ""The demonstrators"".  The reason for this is that ""they"" is a pronoun that is used to refer back to a noun phrase that was previously mentioned, which is ""The demonstrators"". The word ""they"" is a third-person plural pronoun, indicating that the noun it refers to is a group of people, in this case, the demonstrators."	84
1760492844	1760492845	"When Tommy dropped his ice cream, Timmy giggled, so father gave him a sympathetic look.  In the sentence above, does ""him"" refer to ""Timmy""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""him"" does not refer to ""Timmy"" in this sentence.   In this sentence, ""him"" is a pronoun that refers to the person who dropped the ice cream, which is ""Tommy"". The word ""him"" is the object of the verb ""dropped"", indicating that the action of dropping the ice cream was directed towards Tommy.  The pronoun ""him"" is used to refer to the subject of the sentence, which is Tommy. The phrase ""so father gave him a sympathetic look"" implies that the father's sympathetic look was directed towards Tommy, who dropped the ice cream."	127
1760492845	1760492846	"After I saw Bill catching flies and pulling off their wings, I boxed his ears. I showed the master the flies, some crushed and some crawling about helpless, and I showed him the wings on the window sill. I never saw him so angry before; but as Bill was still howling and whining, like the coward that he was, he did not give him any more punishment of that kind, but set him up on a stool for the rest of the afternoon, and said that he should not go out to play for that week.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""the master""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""he"" refers to ""Bill"". The pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to the person who was previously shown the flies, which is Bill. The context of the sentence and the actions described (catching flies, pulling off their wings, being set up on a stool, etc.) also support this interpretation. The master is not the one being punished, but rather the person who is punishing Bill."	88
1760492846	1760492846	"The journalists interviewed the stars of the new movie. They were very cooperative, so the interview lasted for a long time.  In the sentence above, does ""They"" refer to ""The journalists""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""They"" refers to ""The journalists"". This is because the subject of the sentence is ""the journalists"", and the pronoun ""They"" is used to replace the noun phrase. The word ""They"" is a plural pronoun that agrees with the plural noun ""journalists""."	62
1760492846	1760492847	"Joan made sure to thank Susan for all the help she had given.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Susan""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""she"" does not refer to ""Susan"". The pronoun ""she"" is used to refer to the subject of the sentence, which is Joan. The sentence states that Joan is thanking Susan for the help she had given, which means Joan is the one doing the thanking, and ""she"" is a pronoun referring back to Joan.  The word ""Susan"" is the object of the preposition ""for"", indicating that the help was given to Susan, not by Joan."	103
1760492847	1760492849	"In the storm, the tree fell down and crashed through the roof of my house. Now, I have to get it repaired.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""The roof""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""it"" refers to ""The tree"". Here's why:  - The sentence starts with ""In the storm, the tree fell down and crashed through the roof of my house."" The subject of the sentence is ""the tree"", as indicated by the verb ""fell down"". - The phrase ""of my house"" is a prepositional phrase that modifies the subject ""the tree"", indicating the location where the tree crashed. - After the tree is introduced, the verb ""crashed"" is used to describe the action of the tree, not the roof. - Therefore, the pronoun ""it"" refers back to the subject ""the tree"", indicating that the tree crashed through the roof.  So, the sentence is saying that the tree fell down and crashed through the roof of the house."	166
1760492849	1760492849	"Beth didn't get angry with Sally , who had cut her off, because she stopped and counted to ten.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Beth""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""she"" refers to ""Sally"".   The reason for this is that the sentence is describing an action that Sally performed, cutting Beth off, and then Beth's reaction to that action. The use of ""she"" in the phrase ""she stopped and counted to ten"" indicates that the action is being attributed to Sally, as the subject of the sentence."	78
1760492849	1760492850	"The lawyer asked the witness a question, but he was reluctant to repeat it.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""the lawyer""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, in the sentence, ""he"" refers to ""the lawyer"". The pronoun ""he"" is a male singular subject pronoun, and it agrees with the preceding noun ""lawyer"", which is also a male noun. The context of the sentence indicates that the witness is a male, and the pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to the witness, not the lawyer."	80
1760492850	1760492851	"Sir Clifford wants me to find him a new groom , about twenty or twenty-one, who knows his business. His old coachman is getting feeble, and he wants a man to work with him and get into his ways, who would be able, when the old man was pensioned off, to step into his place  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""new groom""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""his"" is indeed referring to ""new groom"". The reason for this is that ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, which indicates that it belongs to or is associated with the noun it precedes. In this case, ""his"" is modifying the noun ""groom"", indicating that the groom belongs to or is the property of Sir Clifford.  The phrase ""Sir Clifford wants him a new groom"" is a bit awkwardly phrased, as it implies that Sir Clifford is searching for a new groom for someone else. However, the intended meaning is likely that Sir Clifford wants to find a new groom for himself, and ""his"" refers to this groom.  It's worth noting that the sentence could be rephrased more clearly to avoid ambiguity: ""Sir Clifford wants me to find a new groom, about twenty or twenty-one, who knows his business..."" would make it clear that Sir Clifford is the one searching for a new groom."	200
1760492851	1760492852	"Since it was raining, I carried the newspaper over my backpack to keep it dry.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""The newspaper""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""it"" does not refer to ""The newspaper"" in the sentence.   The pronoun ""it"" in this sentence refers to the rain. The phrase ""carried the newspaper over my backpack to keep it dry"" indicates that the speaker is carrying the newspaper to protect it (the rain) from falling on it (the newspaper)."	71
1760492852	1760492853	"If the con artist has succeeded in fooling Sam , he would have gotten a lot of money.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""The con artist""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, in the sentence ""If the con artist has succeeded in fooling Sam, he would have gotten a lot of money,"" ""he"" refers to ""the con artist"".   This can be inferred because the sentence is in the conditional tense (""would have gotten""), and the pronoun ""he"" is in the third person singular form, which is typically used to refer to a male subject in the third person (i.e., ""he"" or ""she""). In this context, ""he"" is used to refer to the male con artist, rather than Sam."	116
1760492853	1760492854	"The boy continued to whip the pony , and eventually the pony threw him over. John laughed out quite loud. ""Served him right,"" he said.  In the sentence above, does ""him"" refer to ""pony""? Explain your choice."	"No, in the sentence ""The boy continued to whip the pony, and eventually the pony threw him over. John laughed out quite loud. 'Served him right,' he said.""  The pronoun ""him"" refers to ""John"", not ""pony"". This is because ""him"" is the object of the verb ""laughed"", and in this context, it is clear that John is the one doing the laughing. The use of ""him"" indicates that the action of laughing is being directed towards John, and the phrase ""served him right"" is a idiomatic expression meaning that John deserved to be laughed at."	130
1760492854	1760492855	"I put the cake away in the refrigerator . It has a lot of leftovers in it.  In the sentence above, does ""It"" refer to ""The cake""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""It"" refers to ""the leftovers"" rather than ""the cake"". The reason for this is that the phrase ""has a lot of leftovers in it"" is a prepositional phrase that indicates the location of the leftovers, and ""it"" is the subject of this phrase.  The word ""it"" in this context is a pronoun that refers back to the prepositional phrase ""in it"", which is a prepositional phrase that indicates the location of the leftovers. The prepositional phrase ""in it"" is acting as a noun in this sentence, and ""it"" is the pronoun that refers to it.  In other words, the sentence is saying that the cake (the subject of the sentence) contains a lot of leftovers, rather than that the leftovers are a thing that has a lot of cake in it."	176
1760492855	1760492856	"The fish ate the worm . It was tasty.  In the sentence above, does ""It"" refer to ""The worm""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence ""The fish ate the worm. It was tasty."", ""It"" does not refer to ""The worm"".   The word ""It"" is a pronoun that is used as a subject in the second clause, ""It was tasty"". In this context, ""It"" is referring back to the subject of the first clause, ""The fish"".

1760492856	1760492857	"Babar wonders how he can get new clothing. Luckily, a very rich old man who has always been fond of little elephants understands right away that he is longing for a fine suit.

1760492857	1760492857	"The actress used to be named Terpsichore , but she changed it to Tina a few years ago, because she figured it was easier to pronounce.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""Terpsichore""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""it"" does not refer to ""Terpsichore"".   The pronoun ""it"" refers to ""the reason"" or ""the explanation"" for why the actress changed her name from Terpsichore to Tina. In this context, ""it"" is a pronoun used to refer to a noun (the reason) that is not explicitly stated in the sentence, but can be inferred."	84
1760492857	1760492858	"So Mark slept. It was daylight when he woke with Warren 's hand upon his shoulder.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Warren""? Explain your choice."	"In this sentence, ""his"" is possessive, meaning it shows that the hand belongs to Warren. The word ""his"" is used to indicate that the hand is Warren's hand, not the general hand of someone. This is supported by the context, as the sentence states ""Warren's hand upon his shoulder"".   In this context, ""his"" is used as an adjective to describe the noun ""hand"", indicating that the hand belongs to Warren."	94
1760492858	1760492859	"Fred covered his eyes with his hands , because the wind was blowing sand around. He lowered them when the wind stopped.  In the sentence above, does ""them"" refer to ""His hands""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""them"" does not refer to ""His hands"" in the given sentence.  The reason is that ""his hands"" is a possessive pronoun phrase (a noun phrase that functions as the object of a verb or preposition), and it has an object pronoun ""his"" that agrees with the singular noun ""hands"".   In contrast, ""them"" is an object pronoun (a type of pronoun that functions as the object of a verb or preposition), and it is used to refer to a plural noun.   In this sentence, ""them"" refers to the sand, as indicated by the context (the sand is the thing that was being blown around by the wind)."	144
1760492859	1760492860	"Sir Clifford wants me to find him a new groom , about twenty or twenty-one, who knows his business. His old coachman is getting feeble, and he wants a man to work with him and get into his ways, who would be able, when the old man was pensioned off, to step into his place  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""old coachman""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""his"" refers to ""old coachman"". The reason for this is that ""his"" is a possessive adjective, and it is modifying the noun ""coachman"". The sentence implies that the groom is looking for a new person to work with the old coachman, and the ""his"" in ""his old coachman"" indicates that the groom is referring to the coachman who belongs to him (Sir Clifford).  In other words, ""his"" is showing possession, indicating that the coachman is Sir Clifford's coachman, and the groom is looking for a new person to work with this particular coachman."	131
1760492860	1760492861	"Joe paid the detective after he delivered the final report on the case.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Joe""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence ""Joe paid the detective after he delivered the final report on the case,"" ""he"" refers to ""the detective.""   The reason for this is that ""he"" is the subject of the verb ""delivered"" in the sentence. The verb ""delivered"" is in the past tense, and it is referring back to the action of delivering the report, which is attributed to ""the detective."" The use of ""he"" in this context is a pronoun that agrees with the noun ""detective"" and indicates that it was the detective who delivered the report."	119
1760492861	1760492862	"As Andrea in the crop duster passed over Susan , she could see the landing strip.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Susan""? Explain your choice."

The pronoun ""he"" is a subject pronoun, which is used as the subject of the sentence, indicating that Frank is the one doing the action (being upset)."	72
1760492862	1760492863	"Lily spoke to Donna , breaking her silence.  In the sentence above, does ""her"" refer to ""Donna""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""her"" refers to ""Donna"".   The reason is that ""her"" is a possessive pronoun, which is used to show that something belongs to a person or a group. In this sentence, ""her"" is describing the person that was previously referred to as ""Donna"", indicating that she is the one who broke the silence."	74
1760492863	1760492864	"The cat was lying by the mouse hole waiting for the mouse , but it was too cautious.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""The cat""? Explain your choice."

1760492864	1760492865	"Equally swoon-worthy is C.K. Dexter Haven , a pallid young dandy holding a jade-handled walking stick, with a poodle asleep at his feet  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Haven""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""his"" does not refer to ""Haven"" in this sentence. The pronoun ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, indicating that the walking stick belongs to someone. In this case, the subject of the sentence is ""C.K. Dexter Haven"", which is a compound subject consisting of two nouns.   Since ""Haven"" is a proper noun (a person's name), the pronoun ""his"" should refer to the person ""C.K. Dexter Haven"", not ""Haven"" itself. This is because the possessive form of a proper noun is usually formed by adding the possessive apostrophe, which indicates that the noun is being modified by the pronoun ""his""."	145
1760492865	1760492866	"Sir Clifford wants me to find him a new groom , about twenty or twenty-one, who knows his business. His old coachman is getting feeble, and he wants a man to work with him and get into his ways, who would be able, when the old man was pensioned off, to step into his place.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Sir Clifford""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""his"" is most likely referring to ""the groom"". The context suggests that Sir Clifford is looking for a new groom, and ""his"" is used to describe the groom's skills or abilities, such as knowing his business.  The reason for this inference is that the sentence begins with ""Sir Clifford wants me to find him a new groom"", which indicates that Sir Clifford is the one looking for a new person to fill the role of a groom. The use of ""him"" in the next sentence to refer to the person he is looking for, and the context of the situation, suggests that ""his"" is being used possessively to refer to the groom, rather than Sir Clifford himself."	145
1760492866	1760492867	"The fish ate the worm . It was tasty.  In the sentence above, does ""It"" refer to ""The fish""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence ""The fish ate the worm. It was tasty."", ""It"" is actually referring to ""the worm"". This is because ""It"" is a pronoun that is used as the subject of the second clause, which is ""It was tasty.""   The reason we can determine that ""It"" refers to ""the worm"" is because of the context of the sentence. In the first clause ""The fish ate the worm"", ""It"" is a verb (""ate"") and clearly refers to the subject of the verb, which is ""the fish"".   In the second clause ""It was tasty"", the pronoun ""It"" is now being used to refer to the object that was eaten in the first clause, which is ""the worm"". This is an example of a pronoun shift, where a pronoun is used to refer back to a noun that was previously mentioned in the sentence."	184
1760492867	1760492869	"Lionel is holding captive a scientist, Dr. Vardi , who has invented a device that turns animals invisible; Lionel plans to use it on Geoffrey and send him to steal nuclear material from an army vault.  In the sentence above, does ""him"" refer to ""Lionel""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""him"" in the sentence refers to ""Geoffrey"".  The reason for this is that the subject of the sentence is ""Lionel is holding captive a scientist"", which is a possessive sentence. The possessive pronoun ""his"" is not used, but the word ""him"" is, which is the object of the verb ""is holding"".   In this context, ""him"" is a reflexive object pronoun, which means it is the direct object of the verb ""holding"". This is a common pattern in English, where ""him"" or ""her"" is used as the object of a possessive verb like ""holding"", ""taking"", ""giving"", etc.  In contrast, ""his"" would be used as a possessive pronoun, as in ""Lionel's device"" or ""Lionel's plan""."	179
1760492869	1760492870	"The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence.  In the sentence above, does ""they"" refer to ""The city councilmen""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""they"" refers to ""The city councilmen"" in the sentence.  The pronoun ""they"" is a subject pronoun that refers to a group or a plural noun. In this sentence, ""The city councilmen"" is the subject of the sentence, and ""they"" refers back to this subject. This is an example of a reflexive pronoun, where the pronoun agrees with the subject in number (plural) and is used to refer back to the subject.  In other words, the sentence is saying that the city councilmen (the subject) refused the demonstrators a permit, and ""they"" is a pronoun that refers back to the city councilmen, indicating that it was the city councilmen who refused the permit."	155
1760492870	1760492871	"Frank felt vindicated when his longtime rival Bill revealed that he was the winner of the competition.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Bill""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""he"" does not refer to ""Bill"" in the given sentence.  The sentence states that ""Frank felt vindicated"", which means that Frank was justified or proved to be correct about something. The pronoun ""he"" in this context refers to ""Frank"", indicating that Frank was the one who was vindicated, not Bill."	71
1760492871	1760492871	"Bob collapsed on the sidewalk. Soon he saw Carl coming to help. He was very concerned.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Bob""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""He"" refers to ""Bob"".   The pronoun ""He"" is a he, which is a masculine singular pronoun. It is used to refer to a male person, and in this case, it clearly refers to Bob, as he is the one who collapsed on the sidewalk."	62
1760492871	1760492872	"Dan took the rear seat while Bill claimed the front because his ""Dibs!"" was slow.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Bill""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""his"" is a possessive pronoun that refers to ""Bill"".   The reason for this is the word ""his"" is used in conjunction with ""Dibs"" which is a possessive noun. ""Dibs"" is a possessive noun, meaning it's an object that belongs to Bill. The word ""his"" is used to show that the Dibs belongs to Bill."	84
1760492872	1760492873	"Susan knows all about Ann 's personal problems because she is nosy.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Susan""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, in the sentence ""Susan knows all about Ann's personal problems because she is nosy"", ""she"" refers to ""Susan"".  This is because the sentence is structured in a way that the subject of the sentence ""she"" is implied to be the same as the subject of the previous clause ""Susan"". This is known as a pronoun reference error, where a pronoun is used in place of the noun it is supposed to refer to. In this case, the sentence should be rephrased to make it clear that ""Susan"" is the one who is nosy, like this: ""Susan knows all about Ann's personal problems because she is nosy."""	139
1760492873	1760492873	"Pete envies Martin because he is very successful.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Pete""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""he"" refers to ""Pete"". The pronoun ""he"" is a masculine singular pronoun that agrees with the noun ""Pete"" in the sentence. The subject-verb agreement rule states that a singular noun should be paired with a singular pronoun, and in this case, ""Pete"" is a singular noun."	71
1760492873	1760492875	"Billy cried because Toby wouldn't share his toy.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Billy""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence ""Billy cried because Toby wouldn't share his toy,"" the word ""his"" is actually referring to the possessive form of ""Toby"", not Billy.  The reason for this is that ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, which shows that something belongs to Toby. In this context, ""his"" is describing the toy that belongs to Toby, not Billy.  If the sentence were ""Billy cried because Toby wouldn't share Billy's toy,"" then ""his"" would indeed refer to Billy, indicating that the toy belongs to Billy.  However, in the original sentence, the sentence structure implies that the toy belongs to Toby, which is why ""his"" refers to Toby."	144
1760492875	1760492875	"I poured water from the bottle into the cup until it was full.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""the bottle""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""it"" does not refer to ""the bottle"" in the given sentence.  The sentence states ""until it was full"", which implies that ""it"" refers to the cup. This is because ""it"" is the object that is being filled with water, and the phrase ""until it was full"" indicates the point at which the cup is completely filled.  The use of ""it"" in this context is an example of anaphoric pronoun, where the pronoun refers back to the noun it immediately precedes, in this case, ""the cup""."	118
1760492875	1760492876	"I used an old rag to clean the knife , and then I put it in the trash.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""The knife""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""it"" in the sentence ""In the sentence above, does 'it' refer to 'The knife'?"" refers to ""The knife"".  The reason is that the pronoun ""it"" is used to refer to the object that is the subject of the question, which is ""The knife"". The sentence is asking whether the pronoun ""it"" in the original sentence refers to ""The knife""."	85
1760492876	1760492877	"John hired Bill to take care of him .  In the sentence above, does ""him"" refer to ""Bill""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence ""John hired Bill to take care of him,"" the pronoun ""him"" is actually referring back to ""John"", not ""Bill"". This is because ""him"" is the object of the preposition ""to take care of"", which indicates that John is the one who needs care.   In this context, ""him"" is a reflexive pronoun, which means it refers back to the same subject (John) as the sentence. This is often used to indicate that the action of the verb is being performed on the subject itself."	113
1760492877	1760492878	"Jane knocked on the door, and Susan answered it. She invited her to come out.  In the sentence above, does ""She"" refer to ""Jane""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""She"" refers to ""Susan"". This is because the pronoun ""She"" is used as the subject of the sentence, and it is referring to the person who is performing the action of answering the door, which is Susan. The sentence structure and context also support this interpretation, as ""Susan"" is the one who is described as answering the door, and ""She"" is the pronoun that follows her."	89
1760492878	1760492879	"The journalists interviewed the stars of the new movie. They were very persistent, so the interview lasted for a long time.  In the sentence above, does ""They"" refer to ""The journalists""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, in the sentence ""They"" refers to ""The journalists"".  The pronoun ""They"" is a plural subject pronoun, and in this context, it refers to ""The journalists"" as the ones performing the action described in the sentence. The verb ""were"" is in the third person plural form, which agrees with the plural subject ""They"".  The sentence can be parsed as follows:  - ""The journalists"" (subject) were (verb in the third person plural form) - ""They"" (pronoun, referring back to the subject ""The journalists"")  This is a common grammatical structure in English, where a plural verb agrees with a plural subject, and the pronoun ""They"" refers back to that subject."	153
1760492879	1760492880	"As Ollie carried Tommy up the long winding steps, his legs ached.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Ollie""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, in the sentence ""As Ollie carried Tommy up the long winding steps, his legs ached,"" ""his"" refers to ""Ollie"".  The reason is that ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, which indicates that the legs belong to Ollie. The sentence is describing Ollie's state of having aches in his legs, not Tommy's. The phrase ""up the long winding steps"" is describing the action that Ollie is performing with Tommy, not referring to Ollie's legs."	112
1760492880	1760492881	"Carol believed that Rebecca regretted that she had stolen the watch.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Rebecca""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, in the sentence ""Carol believed that Rebecca regretted that she had stolen the watch,"" ""she"" refers to ""Rebecca"".  The reason for this is that the sentence is structured as a dependent clause, ""that she had stolen the watch"", which is a subordinate clause indicating the reason for Rebecca's regret. The pronoun ""she"" in this context refers back to the subject of the subordinate clause, which is ""Rebecca"". This is a classic example of a pronoun reference, where a pronoun is used to replace a noun in a sentence."	116
1760492881	1760492882	"Bob paid for Charlie 's college education. He is very generous.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Charlie""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""He"" does not refer to ""Charlie"" in the sentence.   The pronoun ""He"" in the sentence is a subject pronoun, which refers to the person performing the action of paying for Charlie's education. The subject of the sentence is ""Bob"", who is the one doing the action of paying. The pronoun ""He"" is a general pronoun, referring to the person who is doing the action, which in this case is Bob, not Charlie."	99
1760492882	1760492882	"All the buttons up the back of Dora 's plaid dress were buttoned outside-in. Maude should have thought to button her up; but no, she had left poor little Dora to do the best she could, alone.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Dora""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""she"" refers to ""Maude"". The pronoun ""she"" is used to refer to the subject of the sentence, which is ""Maude"", the person who left Dora to do the best she could. The sentence is describing the action of Maude, not Dora."	64
1760492882	1760492883	"The table was piled high with food , and on the floor beside it there were crocks, baskets, and a five-quart pail of milk.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""floor""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""it"" refers to ""table"". The pronoun ""it"" is used to refer back to the table mentioned in the previous phrase ""The table was piled high with food"". The word ""it"" is used to introduce the new item, ""the crocks, baskets, and a five-quart pail of milk"", which is adjacent to the table. This is an example of a reflexive pronoun, where ""it"" is used to refer to the previous noun, ""table""."	105
1760492883	1760492884	"Mark was close to Mr. Singer 's heels. He heard him calling for the captain , promising him, in the jargon everyone talked that night, that not one thing should be damaged on the ship except only the ammunition, but the captain and all his crew had best stay in the cabin until the work was over.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Mark""? Explain your choice."	"No, 'his' in the sentence does not refer to ""Mark"". The pronoun ""his"" in the sentence refers to ""Mr. Singer"".  The sentence states that Mark is close to Mr. Singer's heels, indicating a close proximity or following. This suggests that Mark is following or attending to Mr. Singer.  Later, it is stated that the captain and his crew should stay in the cabin until the work is over. Here, ""his"" refers to the captain, indicating that the captain's crew is also included.  In both instances, ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, showing ownership or relation to the noun it precedes, which in both cases is ""Mr. Singer"" and ""captain""."	151
1760492884	1760492886	"The man lifted the boy onto his shoulders.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""The boy""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence ""The man lifted the boy onto his shoulders,"" the pronoun ""his"" is a possessive adjective. It indicates that the shoulders belong to the man, not the boy.  This is a common use of ""his"" in English, where the word is used to show that something belongs to the person or thing that is being referred to. In this case, the sentence is saying that the man is using his own shoulders to lift the boy, so the possessive form ""his"" is used to indicate possession.  If the sentence were saying ""The boy lifted the man onto his shoulders,"" the pronoun ""his"" would not make sense in the same way, because it would imply that the boy is using his own shoulders to lift the man, which is not the intended meaning.  So, in the original sentence, ""his"" refers to the man, not the boy."	184
1760492886	1760492887	"Do you suppose that Peter is responsible for the captain ’s illness? Maybe he bribed the cook to put something in his food.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Peter""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""his"" does indeed refer to ""Peter"". This is because the sentence is in the context of discussing Peter in relation to the captain's illness, and the word ""his"" is used as a possessive adjective to show that Peter is the one who is suspected of being responsible for the captain's illness.  The use of ""his"" implies that the illness belongs to Peter, and the sentence is suggesting that Peter might have intentionally or unintentionally caused the captain's illness, possibly by bribing the cook to put something in his food."	114
1760492887	1760492887	"The signs over the shops' doors had pictures that indicated what work was done inside. Although more and more people were learning how to read, each artisan still had signs, not wishing to lose a possible patron merely because he happened to be illiterate.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""patron""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""he"" refers to ""artisan"".   The reason is that the sentence is describing the practice of artisans having signs to indicate what work they do, and the phrase ""not wishing to lose a possible patron merely because he happened to be illiterate"" is a subordinate clause that provides a reason for this practice.   In this context, ""he"" is a pronoun referring back to the subject of the main clause, which is ""artisan"". The pronoun ""he"" is not referring to a patron, but rather to the artisan who might be illiterate and still wants to attract customers."	122
1760492887	1760492889	"Paul tried to call George on the phone, but he wasn't available.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""George""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""he"" does not necessarily refer to ""George"" in this sentence. The pronoun ""he"" is a subject pronoun that is often used to refer to a male speaker or the person who is performing the action of the verb. However, in this sentence, ""he"" could also refer to Paul, the person trying to call George.  The context of the sentence suggests that Paul is the one trying to call George, and ""he"" is used as the subject of the verb ""wasn't available"", implying that Paul is the one who is not available. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that ""he"" refers to Paul."	133
1760492889	1760492889	"Sam's drawing was hung just above Tina's and it did look much better with another one above it.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""Sam's drawing""? Explain your choice."	"No, in this sentence, ""it"" does not refer to ""Sam's drawing"". The word ""it"" is a pronoun, and its antecedent (the noun it refers to) is not explicitly stated. However, based on the context, we can infer that ""it"" refers to ""the drawing"" or ""the one above it"".   The sentence implies that there is another drawing that is being hung above Sam's drawing, and it looks better with Sam's drawing. The pronoun ""it"" is used to refer to the second drawing."	115
1760492889	1760492890	"The table won't fit through the doorway because it is too wide.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""The table""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""it"" refers to ""The table"".   This is because ""The table"" is the subject of the sentence, and ""it"" is the pronoun that replaces the subject to make the sentence more concise. In this context, ""it"" is a reflexive pronoun, which means it refers back to the subject ""The table""."	74
1760492890	1760492891	"Emma Emma's mother had died long ago, and her education had been managed by an excellent woman as governess.  In the sentence above, does ""her"" refer to ""Emma's mother""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""her"" refers to ""Emma's mother"".   The pronoun ""her"" is a possessive pronoun that indicates that the noun it refers to (in this case, ""mother"") belongs to someone else (Emma). The sentence implies that Emma's mother is deceased, but her education was managed by someone else, specifically an excellent woman who acted as a governess."	79
1760492891	1760492891	"Bill passed the gameboy to John because his turn was next.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""John""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, in the sentence ""Bill passed the gameboy to John because his turn was next,"" ""his"" refers to ""John"".  This is because ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, which indicates that the gameboy belongs to John. The sentence is saying that Bill passed the gameboy that belongs to John to John, as it was John's turn next."	77
1760492891	1760492892	"Of one thing Mark was sure. Harry knew much less than he did.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Harry""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""he"" refers to ""Mark"".   The sentence is saying that Mark is the one who is sure about something, and Harry is the one who knows less about it. The pronoun ""he"" is a subject pronoun, indicating the person performing the action of being sure."	60
1760492892	1760492893	"Do you suppose that Peter is responsible for the captain ’s illness? Maybe he bribed the cook to put something in his food.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""the captain""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""his"" refers to ""the captain"". This is because ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, indicating that the illness belongs to the captain. The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is speculating about the cause of the captain's illness and is implying that the illness may be a result of something done by Peter, and ""his"" is used to show that the illness is the captain's, not Peter's."	92
1760492893	1760492893	"What about the time you cut up tulip bulbs in the hamburgers because you thought they were onions?  In the sentence above, does ""they"" refer to ""hamburgers""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""they"" refers to ""onions"".   This is because the context of the sentence implies that the speaker mistakenly cut up tulip bulbs and thought they were onions, which are often used as a topping for hamburgers. The subject ""they"" in this sentence is referring to the mistaken object, which happens to be the tulip bulbs, not the hamburgers."	79
1760492893	1760492894	"Fred covered his eyes with his hands , because the wind was blowing sand around. He lowered them when the wind stopped.  In the sentence above, does ""them"" refer to ""His eyes""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""them"" does not refer to ""His eyes"".   The reason is that ""them"" is a plural pronoun that is used as the object of a verb or preposition, but in this case, ""his eyes"" is the subject of the sentence.   The sentence is describing the action of Fred covering his eyes, and ""his eyes"" is the one that is being covered. The wind is the one that is doing the action of blowing sand around ""them"", which in this case is the sand."	109
1760492894	1760492894	"Sid explained his theory to Mark but he couldn't understand him.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Sid""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""he"" refers to ""Sid"".   The pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to the subject of the sentence, which is Sid, because it is describing his actions or state of being (trying to explain his theory)."	50
1760492894	1760492895	"Tom gave Ralph a lift to school so he wouldn't have to drive alone.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Ralph""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, in the sentence ""Tom gave Ralph a lift to school so he wouldn't have to drive alone,"" ""he"" refers to ""Tom.""   This is because ""he"" is the subject of the sentence, performing the action of giving Ralph a lift. The pronoun ""he"" agrees with the subject ""Tom"" in number (singular) and person (male)."	77
1760492895	1760492896	"When my parents died, I was not earning enough to keep myself or my crippled sister Nelly , and without our kind mistress , we would have gone to the poorhouse. Nelly calls her her angel and she has good right to do so. her  In the sentence above, does ""her"" refer to ""mistress""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""her"" refers to ""Nelly"".   The reason is that the sentence is in the third person, referring to the narrator's sister Nelly, using ""her"" as the possessive adjective to describe Nelly's relationship with their ""mistress"". The word ""her"" is a pronoun that is used to refer to a female person or thing, and in this context, it is clearly referring to Nelly."	91
1760492896	1760492897	"After I saw Bill catching flies and pulling off their wings, I boxed his ears. I showed the master the flies, some crushed and some crawling about helpless, and I showed him the wings on the window sill. I never saw him so angry before; but as Bill was still howling and whining, like the coward that he was, he did not give him any more punishment of that kind, but set him up on a stool for the rest of the afternoon, and said that he should not go out to play for that week.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""the master""? Explain your choice."	"In this sentence, ""he"" refers to ""Bill"".   The reason for this is that the sentence structure and context suggest that ""he"" is a pronoun that is replacing the noun ""Bill"" in the previous sentence. The phrase ""I showed the master"" suggests that the master is being referred to as a separate person from Bill, and the action of showing the flies to the master is a separate event from the punishment being inflicted on Bill.   Furthermore, the sentence immediately after the event describes Bill's reaction and punishment, which suggests that the focus is on Bill's behavior and consequence, rather than the master's reaction.   So, the use of ""he"" in the sentence refers back to Bill, indicating that Bill is the one who was caught pulling off the flies' wings, and is now facing punishment."	167
1760492897	1760492898	"After I saw Bill catching flies and pulling off their wings, I boxed his ears. I showed the master the flies, some crushed and some crawling about helpless, and I showed him the wings on the window sill. I never saw him so angry before; but as Bill was still howling and whining, like the coward that he was, he did not give him any more punishment of that kind, but set him up on a stool for the rest of the afternoon, and said that he should not go out to play for that week.  In the sentence above, does ""him"" refer to ""the master""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""him"" refers to ""Bill"". The reason is that the pronoun ""him"" is used as the object of the verb ""showed"" in the phrase ""I showed him the flies..."". The verb ""showed"" is in the passive voice, and ""him"" is the object being acted upon, which is Bill. The master is referred to as ""the master"" in the previous sentence, but in this sentence, the focus is on Bill and his actions, so ""him"" refers to Bill.  The master is referred to as the one who is angry and gives the punishment, but the action of showing the flies and the punishment is directed towards Bill. Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" is used to refer to Bill, the person who is the subject of the action."	167
1760492898	1760492899	"Ann asked Mary what time the library closes, because she had forgotten.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Mary""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence ""Ann asked Mary what time the library closes, because she had forgotten,"" the pronoun ""she"" actually refers to ""Ann"", not ""Mary"".  This is because the sentence starts with ""Ann asked Mary"", which makes it clear that ""Ann"" is the subject performing the action of asking. The pronoun ""she"" is a subject pronoun that agrees with the subject ""Ann"" in number (singular) and is used to refer back to the subject of the previous clause."	103
