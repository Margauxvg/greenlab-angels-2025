1760478096	1760478097	"Mark told Pete many lies about himself, which Pete included in his book. He should have been more skeptical.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Mark""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""He"" refers to ""Mark"".   This can be inferred because the sentence states ""Mark told Pete many lies about himself"". The pronoun ""he"" is in the subject position, referring back to the subject ""Mark"" mentioned in the previous clause. This is an example of a pronoun reference, where a pronoun (in this case ""he"") refers back to a noun (in this case ""Mark"") that was mentioned earlier in the sentence."	96	
1760478097	1760478098	"The mothers of Arthur and Celeste have come to the town to fetch them. They are very happy to have them back, but they scold them just the same because they ran away.  In the sentence above, does ""them"" refer to ""mothers""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, in the sentence ""The mothers of Arthur and Celeste have come to the town to fetch them. They are very happy to have them back, but they scold them just the same because they ran away,"" ""them"" refers to ""Arthur and Celeste"".  This is because ""them"" is a pronoun that refers back to the subject of the previous clause, which is ""Arthur and Celeste"". In this context, ""them"" is used to refer to the two children, rather than the mothers. The phrase ""The mothers of Arthur and Celeste"" is a prepositional phrase that provides more information about who Arthur and Celeste are related to, but it does not affect the meaning of ""them""."	149	
1760478098	1760478098	"Mark was close to Mr. Singer 's heels. He heard him calling for the captain, promising him, in the jargon everyone talked that night, that not one thing should be damaged on the ship except only the ammunition, but the captain and all his crew had best stay in the cabin until the work was over  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Mr. Singer""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""He"" refers to ""Mark"" in this sentence. The pronoun ""He"" is used as a subject of the sentence, indicating the person performing the action of staying in the cabin. The verb ""had best stay"" implies that Mark is the one being advised by Mr. Singer."	62	
1760478098	1760478099	"The pony behaved well, sir, and showed no vice; but at last he just threw up his heels and tipped the young gentleman into the thorn hedge. He wanted me to help him out, but I hope you will excuse me, sir, I did not feel inclined to do so.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""young gentleman""? Explain your choice."	"In this sentence, ""He"" is a pronoun that refers to ""the pony.""   The reason for this is that the sentence structure suggests that ""He"" is the subject of the verb ""threw up his heels."" The verb ""threw"" is in the third person singular form, which indicates that the subject is a male noun. Since ""the pony"" is the subject, ""He"" is the pronoun that agrees with it in number and person."	96	
1760478099	1760478100	"I poured water from the bottle into the cup until it was full.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""the cup""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""it"" refers to ""the cup"". Here's why:  The sentence ""I poured water from the bottle into the cup until it was full"" is an example of a dangling modifier. The phrase ""until it was full"" is intended to describe the state of the cup, but it's not clearly linked to the cup. To fix this, the sentence should be rephrased to make it clear that ""it"" refers to the cup.  Here's a corrected version: ""I poured water from the bottle into the cup until the cup was full.""  In this revised sentence, the word ""it"" clearly refers to the cup, indicating that the cup's state of being full is what the action of pouring is being described."	156	
1760478100	1760478101	"Dan had to stop Bill from toying with the injured bird. He is very compassionate.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Dan""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""He"" refers to ""Dan"".   This can be inferred because the sentence states ""Dan had to stop Bill from toying with the injured bird."" This implies that Dan is the one performing the action of stopping Bill from toying with the bird. The use of ""he"" in the sentence is a third-person singular pronoun, referring back to the subject ""Dan"" in the sentence."	83	
1760478101	1760478102	"Sam Goodman 's biography of the Spartan general Xenophanes conveys a vivid sense of the difficulties he faced in his childhood.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Goodman""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""he"" refers to ""Xenophanes"". The reason is that the sentence is discussing Xenophanes, a historical figure, and ""he"" is used as the subject of the sentence, referring to Xenophanes. The use of ""he"" is a general pronoun referring to a male person, which in this context is Xenophanes.  The phrase ""Sam Goodman's biography"" is a possessive phrase indicating that the biography belongs to Sam Goodman, but it doesn't affect the subject of the sentence, which is still Xenophanes."	118	
1760478102	1760478103	"Pam's parents came home and found her having sex with her boyfriend, Paul. They were furious about it.  In the sentence above, does ""They"" refer to ""Pam's parents""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""They"" refers to ""Pam's parents"" in the sentence. The reason for this is that ""Pam's parents"" is a noun phrase acting as the subject of the sentence. The phrase ""Pam's parents"" is a single entity, and the pronoun ""They"" is used to refer back to this entity. This is an example of a reflexive pronoun usage, where the pronoun ""They"" agrees with the noun phrase ""Pam's parents"" in number (both are plural)."	108	1.0
1760478103	1760478104	"Bob paid for Charlie 's college education, but now Charlie acts as though it never happened. He is very hurt.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Bob""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""He"" refers to ""Bob"".   The pronoun ""He"" is a he who performed the action of paying for Charlie's college education. The verb ""paid"" is in the past tense, which indicates that the action of paying happened in the past, and ""He"" is the subject of the sentence. The use of ""He"" also implies that Bob is the one who performed the action, as the sentence states that ""Bob paid for Charlie's college education""."	99	
1760478104	1760478105	"Billy cried because Toby wouldn't share his toy.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Toby""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""his"" does not necessarily refer to ""Toby"" in the given sentence. The pronoun ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, which means it shows ownership. However, in this sentence, ""his"" is used to describe the noun ""toy"", indicating that the toy belongs to Billy, not Toby.  To confirm, look at the context and the sentence structure. The sentence states ""Billy cried because Toby wouldn't share his toy"", where ""his"" is clearly referring to the toy, not Toby. If it were referring to Toby, the sentence would be ""Billy cried because Toby wouldn't share his""."	130	
1760478105	1760478105	"Emma did not pass the ball to Janie although she was open.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Janie""? Explain your choice."	"In this sentence, ""she"" does not refer to ""Janie"".   The pronoun ""she"" is used to refer to Emma, as it is the subject of the sentence. The phrase ""although she was open"" indicates that Emma was open to receive the ball, not Janie.   The correct pronoun to use in this context would be ""she"", as it is the subject of the sentence, not ""Janie""."	90	
1760478105	1760478106	"Sam's drawing was hung just above Tina's and it did look much better with another one below it.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""Sam's drawing""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""it"" does not refer to ""Sam's drawing"".   The sentence implies that the subject of the sentence is ""another one"" which refers to Tina's drawing. The pronoun ""it"" is used to refer to Tina's drawing in the context of the sentence, as in ""it looks better with another one below it""."	70	
1760478106	1760478107	"Bob paid for Charlie 's college education, but now Charlie acts as though it never happened. He is very ungrateful.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Bob""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""He"" indeed refers to ""Bob"".   The reason is that ""He"" is the subject of the sentence, and it is clearly referring to the person who paid for Charlie's college education. The pronoun ""he"" is also in the third person singular form, which is typically used to refer to a male person. Since the sentence states that Bob paid for Charlie's education, it is logical to conclude that ""he"" is referring to Bob."	97	
1760478107	1760478108	"The lawyer asked the witness a question, but he was reluctant to answer it.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""the lawyer""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""he"" is actually referring to ""the witness"". The reason for this is that the sentence starts with ""The lawyer asked the witness a question"", where ""the lawyer"" is the subject of the sentence. The pronoun ""he"" is a subject pronoun, and in this context, it refers back to the subject ""the lawyer"" (or more specifically, the lawyer who is asking the question).  This is an example of a pronoun antecedent, where a pronoun (""he"") refers to a noun (the lawyer) that has been previously mentioned in the sentence."	124	1.0
1760478108	1760478109	"Sam took French classes from Adam , because he was eager to speak it fluently.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Sam""? Explain your choice."	"In this sentence, ""he"" refers to ""Sam"".   The pronoun ""he"" is a subject pronoun, which is a pronoun that takes the place of a noun in a sentence. In this case, ""he"" is used as the subject of the sentence, and it clearly refers to the person performing the action described by the verb ""took"". Since the sentence states ""Sam took French classes from Adam"", it is clear that ""he"" is referring back to Sam, who is the one taking the French classes."	109	0.6
1760478109	1760478109	"Sid explained his theory to Mark but he couldn't convince him.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Mark""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""he"" in the sentence refers to ""Mark"". The pronoun ""he"" is a masculine singular subject pronoun, and it agrees with the subject of the sentence, which is ""Mark"". The sentence implies that Mark is the one who was unable to convince Sid of his theory."	61	
1760478109	1760478110	"The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence.  In the sentence above, does ""they"" refer to ""The demonstrators""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, in the sentence, ""they"" refers to ""The demonstrators"".   The reason is that ""they"" is a plural pronoun that agrees in number with the noun ""demonstrators"". ""Demonstrators"" is a plural noun, and ""they"" is the correct pronoun to use when referring to a group of people, especially in this context where the subject is a group performing an action."	85	
1760478110	1760478111	"When Tommy dropped his ice cream, Timmy giggled, so father gave him a sympathetic look.  In the sentence above, does ""him"" refer to ""Timmy""? Explain your choice."	"No, in the sentence ""When Tommy dropped his ice cream, Timmy giggled, so father gave him a sympathetic look,"" ""him"" does not refer to ""Timmy"".  The reason is that ""him"" is a pronoun that is the object of the verb ""gave"". The verb ""gave"" is in the form of the infinitive phrase ""gave him a sympathetic look"", where ""him"" is the direct object of the verb ""gave"". The subject of the sentence is ""father"", and the action of the verb ""gave"" is being performed on ""him"".  In this sentence, ""Timmy"" is the subject of the verb ""giggled"", which is a separate action happening before the action of the verb ""gave"". Therefore, ""him"" refers to the person who received the sympathetic look, which is the father, not Timmy."	185	
1760478111	1760478112	"After I saw Bill catching flies and pulling off their wings, I boxed his ears. I showed the master the flies, some crushed and some crawling about helpless, and I showed him the wings on the window sill. I never saw him so angry before; but as Bill was still howling and whining, like the coward that he was, he did not give him any more punishment of that kind, but set him up on a stool for the rest of the afternoon, and said that he should not go out to play for that week.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""the master""? Explain your choice."	"In this sentence, ""he"" refers to ""Bill"".   The reason for this is that the context of the sentence suggests that the master is the one who was previously angry, but Bill is the one who was punished. The master is also the one who sets Bill up on a stool and forbids him from playing for a week.  The pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to Bill, the person who was punished, throughout the sentence. The master is referred to as the ""master"" or ""him"" in other parts of the sentence, but not as ""he"" when describing the action of punishing Bill."	128	
1760478112	1760478113	"The journalists interviewed the stars of the new movie. They were very cooperative, so the interview lasted for a long time.  In the sentence above, does ""They"" refer to ""The journalists""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, in the sentence ""They"" refers to ""The journalists"".  The reason is that ""They"" is a plural pronoun, and in this context, it is used to refer to the journalists as a single group. The use of ""They"" indicates that the journalists are being referred to collectively, rather than individually. The sentence is saying that all of the journalists were very cooperative, not just one of them.  If the sentence were referring to the journalists individually, the pronoun ""They"" would be replaced with ""He"" or ""She"", for example: ""He was very cooperative"" or ""She was very cooperative""."	130	
1760478113	1760478114	"Joan made sure to thank Susan for all the help she had given.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Susan""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence ""Joan made sure to thank Susan for all the help she had given,"" ""she"" does not refer to ""Susan.""   The reason is that ""she"" is a pronoun that refers back to the subject of the sentence, which is ""Joan."" The word ""Susan"" is a proper noun, a specific person's name, and it is not the subject of the sentence.   In this context, ""she"" is a pronoun that agrees with Joan, indicating that Joan is the one who is doing the action of thanking Susan."	116	
1760478114	1760478116	"In the storm, the tree fell down and crashed through the roof of my house. Now, I have to get it repaired.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""The roof""? Explain your choice."	"In this sentence, ""it"" is ambiguous and can be interpreted in two ways.  1. One possible interpretation is that ""it"" refers to the tree. In this case, the sentence would be saying that the tree fell down and crashed through the roof of the house. This interpretation is plausible, as the sentence mentions ""the tree"" earlier in the sentence.  2. Another possible interpretation is that ""it"" refers to the roof of the house. In this case, the sentence would be saying that the tree fell down and crashed through the roof of the house, which is the more common and logical meaning of the sentence.  However, the ambiguity is resolved when we consider the context of the sentence. The sentence mentions ""the tree"" earlier, which suggests that the tree is the main subject of the sentence, and the roof is the object that was affected by the tree. Therefore, the more likely interpretation is that ""it"" refers to the roof of the house.  It's worth noting that this type of ambiguity is a classic example of an anaphora, where a pronoun is used to refer back to a noun that was mentioned earlier in the sentence. In this case, the pronoun ""it"" is used to refer back to ""the roof"" that was mentioned earlier in the sentence."	269	
1760478116	1760478117	"Beth didn't get angry with Sally , who had cut her off, because she stopped and counted to ten.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Beth""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""she"" refers to ""Beth"".   The reason is that ""she"" is in the subject position, which is the subject of the sentence. The subject of a sentence is the noun or pronoun that performs the action described by the verb. In this case, the verb is ""stopped"", and the subject is ""Beth"". Therefore, ""she"" must refer to Beth."	82	
1760478117	1760478118	"The lawyer asked the witness a question, but he was reluctant to repeat it.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""the lawyer""? Explain your choice."	"In this sentence, ""he"" is not referring to ""the lawyer"". The correct interpretation is that ""he"" refers to the witness. The sentence implies that the witness was reluctant to repeat the question asked by the lawyer, but it doesn't state that the lawyer is the one who is reluctant. The word order suggests that the witness is the one who is hesitant to repeat the question, and ""he"" is used as the subject of the sentence to refer to the witness."	97	
1760478118	1760478119	"Sir Clifford wants me to find him a new groom , about twenty or twenty-one, who knows his business. His old coachman is getting feeble, and he wants a man to work with him and get into his ways, who would be able, when the old man was pensioned off, to step into his place  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""new groom""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""his"" indeed refers to ""new groom"". The reason for this is that ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, which means it shows ownership or belonging. In this context, ""his"" is used to indicate that Sir Clifford is referring to the new groom as something that belongs to him, i.e., he wants to find a new groom for his stable or his use.  The word ""his"" is also used in the phrase ""get into his ways"", which implies that the new groom needs to learn and become accustomed to Sir Clifford's habits, routines, and expectations. This further supports the idea that ""his"" refers to the new groom.  If ""his"" were to refer to the old coachman, the sentence would likely read ""get into the old man's ways"", which would change the meaning of the sentence entirely."	177	
1760478119	1760478120	"Since it was raining, I carried the newspaper over my backpack to keep it dry.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""The newspaper""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""it"" refers to ""The newspaper"" in the sentence.  The reason is that ""it"" is a pronoun that replaces the noun ""the newspaper"". The sentence states that the speaker is carrying ""the newspaper"" over their backpack, and then says ""it"" to refer back to the same thing. This is an example of a reflexive pronoun, where the pronoun ""it"" refers back to the same noun it was originally introduced.  In other words, the sentence is saying ""I carried the newspaper over my backpack to keep it dry"", where ""it"" is a pronoun that refers back to the noun ""the newspaper""."	135	
1760478120	1760478121	"If the con artist has succeeded in fooling Sam , he would have gotten a lot of money.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""The con artist""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""he"" refers to ""The con artist"" in the sentence.   The pronoun ""he"" is a masculine singular subject pronoun, and in this context, it logically refers to the subject of the sentence, which is ""The con artist"". The sentence structure implies that the con artist is the one who has succeeded in fooling Sam and would have gotten a lot of money."	81	
1760478121	1760478121	"The boy continued to whip the pony , and eventually the pony threw him over. John laughed out quite loud. ""Served him right,"" he said.  In the sentence above, does ""him"" refer to ""pony""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""him"" does not refer to ""pony"".   In this sentence, ""him"" refers to ""John"". The pronoun ""him"" is the object of the verb ""laughed out quite loud"", indicating that John was the one laughing."	55	
1760478121	1760478123	"I put the cake away in the refrigerator . It has a lot of leftovers in it.  In the sentence above, does ""It"" refer to ""The cake""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence ""I put the cake away in the refrigerator. It has a lot of leftovers in it."", the pronoun ""it"" can be either ""The cake"" or ""the leftovers"", depending on the interpretation.  However, based on the context, it is more likely that ""it"" refers to ""the leftovers"". Here's why:  * The sentence structure suggests that the action of putting the cake away in the refrigerator is a single event, and then ""it"" refers to the result of that action, which is the leftovers. * The phrase ""has a lot of leftovers in it"" implies that the leftovers are what remain after the cake was put away, rather than the cake itself. * The use of the word ""it"" at the end of the sentence also suggests a sense of finality, implying that the leftovers are what's left after the cake was stored.  So, while both interpretations are possible, the most logical choice is that ""it"" refers to the leftovers."	204	
1760478123	1760478124	"The fish ate the worm . It was tasty.  In the sentence above, does ""It"" refer to ""The worm""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence ""The fish ate the worm. It was tasty."", ""It"" does not refer to ""The worm"".  The reason is that ""It"" is a pronoun, and in this context, it is used to refer to the subject of the verb ""was tasty"". The verb ""was tasty"" is a linking verb (a form of ""to be"") that connects the subject to an adjective or an adjective phrase, describing the state of the fish.  So, ""It"" refers to ""the fish"", which is the subject of the sentence. The phrase ""the worm"" is a separate object of the verb ""ate"", which is the direct object of the sentence."	141	
1760478124	1760478125	"Babar wonders how he can get new clothing. Luckily, a very rich old man who has always been fond of little elephants understands right away that he is longing for a fine suit. As he likes to make people happy, he gives him his wallet.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Babar""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, in the sentence, ""he"" refers to ""Babar"". The reason for this is that the sentence states ""Babar wonders how he can get new clothing"", which indicates that Babar is the one who is longing for a fine suit. The pronoun ""he"" is used to refer back to Babar, indicating that Babar is the subject of the sentence."	78	
1760478125	1760478125	"The actress used to be named Terpsichore , but she changed it to Tina a few years ago, because she figured it was easier to pronounce.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""Terpsichore""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""it"" refers to ""Terpsichore"" in this sentence.   The pronoun ""it"" is used to replace the noun ""Terpsichore"" in the phrase ""it was easier to pronounce."" The context suggests that the change from Terpsichore to Tina was made because it was easier to pronounce, and ""it"" is a direct object of the verb ""was""."	83	
1760478125	1760478126	"So Mark slept. It was daylight when he woke with Warren 's hand upon his shoulder.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Warren""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""his"" does not refer to ""Warren"" in this sentence.  The reason is that ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, which indicates that the noun it precedes belongs to the subject of the sentence. In this case, the subject is ""Mark"", and the pronoun ""his"" is referring back to Mark, not Warren.  The sentence is describing the action of Warren placing his hand on Mark's shoulder. The correct word order would be ""Warren's hand was upon Mark's shoulder""."	109	
1760478126	1760478127	"Fred covered his eyes with his hands , because the wind was blowing sand around. He lowered them when the wind stopped.  In the sentence above, does ""them"" refer to ""His hands""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""them"" does not refer to ""His hands"" in the given sentence.  In this sentence, ""them"" refers to ""his eyes"". This is because ""his eyes"" are the ones being covered with his hands, and the pronoun ""them"" is used as the object of the verb ""were"". The verb ""were"" indicates a past tense action, and ""them"" is the object of the verb ""were"", so it refers to the subject of the sentence, which is ""his eyes""."	107	
1760478127	1760478128	"Sir Clifford wants me to find him a new groom , about twenty or twenty-one, who knows his business. His old coachman is getting feeble, and he wants a man to work with him and get into his ways, who would be able, when the old man was pensioned off, to step into his place  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""old coachman""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""his"" refers to ""old coachman"". This is because ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, indicating that the coachman belongs to or is associated with Sir Clifford. The phrase ""his old coachman"" implies that the coachman is a person who was previously employed by Sir Clifford, and ""his"" is used to show that Sir Clifford is referring to that specific individual.  The use of ""his"" is also reinforced by the context, as Sir Clifford is seeking a new groom to replace the old coachman, suggesting that the old coachman is no longer employed by Sir Clifford."	127	
1760478128	1760478129	"Joe paid the detective after he delivered the final report on the case.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Joe""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""he"" refers to ""Joe"". The pronoun ""he"" is a subject pronoun, which is used as the subject of the sentence. In this case, ""he"" is the subject of the verb ""delivered"", and it clearly refers to Joe, the person who delivered the report."	64	
1760478129	1760478129	"As Andrea in the crop duster passed over Susan , she could see the landing strip.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Susan""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""she"" refers to ""Andrea"".   The reason is that ""Andrea"" is the one performing the action of passing over the landing strip in the sentence. The use of the pronoun ""she"" indicates that the person performing the action is a female, and since Andrea is the only female mentioned in the sentence, it logically follows that ""she"" refers to Andrea."	80	
1760478129	1760478130	"Frank was upset with Tom because the toaster he had bought from him didn't work.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Tom""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""he"" refers to ""Tom"".   This is because ""he"" is a pronoun that takes the subject of the sentence, which is ""Tom"". In this context, ""he"" is used as a subject pronoun to refer to Tom, indicating that Tom is the one who sold the toaster to Frank."	67	
1760478130	1760478130	"Lily spoke to Donna , breaking her silence.  In the sentence above, does ""her"" refer to ""Donna""? Explain your choice."

"No, ""it"" does not necessarily refer to ""The cat"". The pronoun ""it"" is used here as a subject, and in this context, it is unclear who or what ""it"" is.   The sentence is describing the action of waiting, but it doesn't specify what is doing the waiting. It could be the cat, the mouse, or something else entirely. The word ""it"" is left ambiguous, leaving the reader to make an inference about what is performing the action."	102	
1760478131	1760478132	"Equally swoon-worthy is C.K. Dexter Haven , a pallid young dandy holding a jade-handled walking stick, with a poodle asleep at his feet  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Haven""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""his"" in the sentence does not refer to ""Haven"".   The sentence states that C.K. Dexter Haven is a pallid young dandy holding a jade-handled walking stick, with a poodle asleep at his feet. The word ""his"" is used to describe the poodle, indicating that the poodle belongs to C.K. Dexter Haven."	77	
1760478132	1760478132	"Sir Clifford wants me to find him a new groom , about twenty or twenty-one, who knows his business. His old coachman is getting feeble, and he wants a man to work with him and get into his ways, who would be able, when the old man was pensioned off, to step into his place.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Sir Clifford""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, in the sentence, ""his"" refers to ""Sir Clifford"".   The reason for this is that the sentence is describing a process of finding a replacement for someone (the coachman), and ""his"" is being used as a possessive pronoun to indicate that the coachman belongs to or is associated with Sir Clifford. This is a common usage of ""his"" in this context, indicating that Sir Clifford is the owner or employer of the coachman."	95	
1760478132	1760478133	"The fish ate the worm . It was tasty.  In the sentence above, does ""It"" refer to ""The fish""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence ""The fish ate the worm. It was tasty."", ""It"" is actually referring to ""the worm"".   This is because the verb ""ate"" is in the past tense, which implies a completed action. The subject of the verb ""ate"" is ""the fish"", but the focus of the action is the worm. The word ""It"" is a pronoun that refers back to the subject that performed the action, which is ""the fish""."	96	0.8
1760478133	1760478134	"Lionel is holding captive a scientist, Dr. Vardi , who has invented a device that turns animals invisible; Lionel plans to use it on Geoffrey and send him to steal nuclear material from an army vault.  In the sentence above, does ""him"" refer to ""Lionel""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""him"" in the sentence refers to ""Geoffrey"".   The reason is that the sentence is in the second person, which is a grammatical device that refers to the person speaking directly. The use of ""him"" here is a pronoun that agrees with the subject ""Geoffrey"", indicating that Geoffrey is the one who is going to be turned invisible."	78	
1760478134	1760478136	"The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence.  In the sentence above, does ""they"" refer to ""The city councilmen""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, in the sentence, ""they"" refers to ""The city councilmen"".  The reason is that ""they"" is the subject of the sentence, and it's a plural pronoun. The subject is ""The city councilmen"", which is a plural noun phrase consisting of a singular noun (""councilmen"") and an indefinite article (""The""). The use of ""they"" to refer to a singular subject is an example of a linguistic phenomenon called a ""subject-verb agreement error"" or ""subject-verb agreement inconsistency"".  In English, when the subject of a sentence is singular, the verb should also be singular, even if the noun is plural. However, when the subject is a singular noun phrase with an indefinite article (""a"" or ""an""), the verb may be singular or plural, depending on the context and the specific grammar rules being followed. In this case, the sentence uses a plural verb (""refused"") to agree with the plural noun phrase ""The city councilmen"", but it's not a typical or idiomatic construction."	215	
1760478136	1760478136	"Frank felt vindicated when his longtime rival Bill revealed that he was the winner of the competition.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Bill""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""he"" does not refer to ""Bill"" in the sentence.  The pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to Frank, the subject of the sentence, who is expressing feelings of vindication. The sentence states ""Frank felt vindicated"", indicating that Frank is the one experiencing the emotions. The phrase ""his longtime rival Bill"" is an independent clause providing additional information about the context, but it does not change the subject of the sentence, which remains ""Frank""."	99	
1760478136	1760478137	"Bob collapsed on the sidewalk. Soon he saw Carl coming to help. He was very concerned.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Bob""? Explain your choice."

1760478137	1760478137	"Dan took the rear seat while Bill claimed the front because his ""Dibs!"" was slow.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Bill""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""his"" refers to ""Bill"".   This is because ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, which means it shows ownership or belonging. In this context, ""his"" indicates that the ""Dibs"" (a term often used informally to claim something) belongs to Bill."	62	
1760478137	1760478138	"Susan knows all about Ann 's personal problems because she is nosy.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Susan""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence ""Susan knows all about Ann's personal problems because she is nosy,"" ""she"" refers to ""Ann"".   The reason is that the sentence is describing the reason why Susan knows about Ann's problems, which is that Ann is nosy. The pronoun ""she"" is used to refer back to the person who is described in the subordinate clause ""because she is nosy"". This subordinate clause is describing Ann's character, and ""she"" is a pronoun that refers to Ann."	104	
1760478138	1760478139	"Pete envies Martin because he is very successful.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Pete""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""he"" does not refer to ""Pete"" in the given sentence.   The pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to ""Martin"", the person who is described as very successful, and who is the object of Pete's envy."	53	
1760478139	1760478139	"Billy cried because Toby wouldn't share his toy.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Billy""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""his"" refers to ""Billy"". The reason is that ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, which indicates that something belongs to Billy. The sentence states ""Billy cried because Toby wouldn't share his toy"", which means that the toy belongs to Billy, and he is upset because Toby won't share it with him."	69	
1760478139	1760478140	"I poured water from the bottle into the cup until it was full.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""the bottle""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""it"" does not refer to ""the bottle"" in this sentence.   In this sentence, ""it"" refers to ""the cup"".   This is because ""until it was full"" is an idiomatic expression that indicates the point at which the action of filling the cup was completed. In this context, ""it"" is the cup that was being filled with water, not the bottle."	83	
1760478140	1760478141	"I used an old rag to clean the knife , and then I put it in the trash.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""The knife""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""it"" in the sentence ""I used an old rag to clean the knife, and then I put it in the trash"" refers to ""The knife"".  The pronoun ""it"" is a direct object pronoun, which indicates the thing that receives the action of the verb ""put"". In this case, the verb ""put"" is the action, and ""it"" refers to the object that is being put, which is the knife."	94	
1760478141	1760478141	"John hired Bill to take care of him .  In the sentence above, does ""him"" refer to ""Bill""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""him"" refers to ""John"". The pronoun ""him"" is the object of the preposition ""hired"", which is a verb that takes an object. In this case, John is the one performing the action of hiring, and ""him"" is the object of that action, indicating who was hired.  This is an example of an objective pronoun, which is used to refer to the object of a verb or preposition."	95	
1760478141	1760478142	"Jane knocked on the door, and Susan answered it. She invited her to come out.  In the sentence above, does ""She"" refer to ""Jane""? Explain your choice."

1760478142	1760478142	"The journalists interviewed the stars of the new movie. They were very persistent, so the interview lasted for a long time.  In the sentence above, does ""They"" refer to ""The journalists""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""They"" refers to ""The journalists"" in the sentence.   This is because ""The journalists"" is the subject of the sentence, and ""They"" is the pronoun used to refer back to this subject. The pronoun ""They"" agrees in number (plural) with the subject ""The journalists"", indicating that there are multiple journalists being referred to."	76	
1760478142	1760478143	"As Ollie carried Tommy up the long winding steps, his legs ached.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Ollie""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""his"" refers to ""Ollie"".   This is because ""his"" is a possessive pronoun that shows ownership, indicating that the thing or person referred to by ""his"" belongs to Ollie.

1760478143	1760478144	"Carol believed that Rebecca regretted that she had stolen the watch.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Rebecca""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""she"" refers to ""Rebecca"". The reason is that the sentence is structured as a relative clause, which begins with the word ""that"". Relative clauses are used to provide more information about a noun in the main clause. In this case, ""that she had stolen the watch"" is a dependent clause that describes Rebecca. The word ""she"" is the subject of this dependent clause, referring back to the noun ""Rebecca"" in the main clause."	96	
1760478144	1760478144	"Bob paid for Charlie 's college education. He is very generous.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Charlie""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""He"" does not refer to ""Charlie"".   In the sentence, ""He"" refers to ""Bob"". This is because ""Bob"" is the subject of the sentence and is performing the action of paying for Charlie's college education. The pronoun ""He"" is a subject pronoun, and it refers back to the subject of the sentence, which is ""Bob""."	79	1.0
1760478144	1760478145	"All the buttons up the back of Dora 's plaid dress were buttoned outside-in. Maude should have thought to button her up; but no, she had left poor little Dora to do the best she could, alone.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Dora""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""she"" refers to ""Dora"".   The reason is that the sentence begins with ""All the buttons up the back of Dora's plaid dress were buttoned outside-in."" The pronoun ""Dora"" is used to refer to the subject of the sentence, which is the person wearing the dress. When the sentence continues, ""Maude should have thought to button her up; but no, she had left poor little Dora to do the best she could, alone,"" the pronoun ""she"" refers back to the subject ""Dora"" that was introduced earlier, indicating that ""she"" is Dora."	131	
1760478145	1760478146	"The table was piled high with food , and on the floor beside it there were crocks, baskets, and a five-quart pail of milk.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""floor""? Explain your choice."	"In this sentence, ""it"" refers to ""the table"".   The pronoun ""it"" is used to refer to the subject of the previous clause, which is ""the table"". The sentence structure suggests that ""it"" is being used to refer to the table because the clause ""on the floor beside it"" is describing the location of the objects (crocks, baskets, and the milk pail) relative to the table."	89	
1760478146	1760478147	"Mark was close to Mr. Singer 's heels. He heard him calling for the captain , promising him, in the jargon everyone talked that night, that not one thing should be damaged on the ship except only the ammunition, but the captain and all his crew had best stay in the cabin until the work was over.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Mark""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""his"" does not refer to ""Mark"". The correct interpretation is that ""his"" refers to ""Mr. Singer"".  The reason for this is that the pronoun ""his"" is a possessive adjective, which shows that the ship belongs to Mr. Singer. The sentence implies that Mr. Singer owns the ship, and ""his"" is describing the ship.   The sentence structure and the context also support this interpretation. The phrase ""at his heels"" suggests that Mr. Singer is the one who is in control or has authority, which further emphasizes that ""his"" refers to the ship."	125	
1760478147	1760478148	"The man lifted the boy onto his shoulders.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""The boy""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence ""The man lifted the boy onto his shoulders,"" the word ""his"" is a possessive adjective. It refers back to the noun ""shoulders,"" which is a common noun. The sentence is describing the man's action of lifting the boy onto his shoulders, so ""his"" is used to indicate possession of the shoulders.  If ""his"" were to refer to ""The boy,"" the sentence would imply that the boy is the one possessing the shoulders, which doesn't make sense in this context.  So, in this case, ""his"" is used to describe the man's shoulders, indicating possession."	128	
1760478148	1760478150	"Do you suppose that Peter is responsible for the captain ’s illness? Maybe he bribed the cook to put something in his food.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Peter""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence ""Do you suppose that Peter is responsible for the captain's illness? Maybe he bribed the cook to put something in his food,"" the word ""his"" refers to ""food"", not ""Peter"".  The reason for this is that the sentence is asking about Peter's possible actions, but it's the cook who is the one who is doing the action of putting something in the food. So, the pronoun ""his"" is referring to the food, indicating that the cook is the one who put something in it.  If the sentence were asking about Peter's actions, the pronoun would be ""his"", as in ""Do you suppose that Peter is responsible for the captain's illness? Maybe he bribed the cook to put something in his food."" However, in this case, the word ""his"" refers to the food, not Peter."	177	
1760478150	1760478150	"The signs over the shops' doors had pictures that indicated what work was done inside. Although more and more people were learning how to read, each artisan still had signs, not wishing to lose a possible patron merely because he happened to be illiterate.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""patron""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""he"" refers to ""artisan"".   The reason for this choice is that the pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to the subject of the previous sentence, which is ""artisan"". The sentence states ""Although more and more people were learning how to read, each artisan still had signs..."", so ""he"" is a pronoun used to refer back to the subject ""artisan"" in the previous clause."	88	
1760478150	1760478151	"Paul tried to call George on the phone, but he wasn't available.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""George""? Explain your choice."	"In this sentence, ""he"" refers to ""Paul"". The reason for this is that ""Paul"" is the subject of the sentence, and ""he"" is a pronoun used to refer to the subject in the second clause. In this case, ""he"" is used as a pronoun to refer back to Paul, who is the one trying to call George."	76	
1760478151	1760478152	"Sam's drawing was hung just above Tina's and it did look much better with another one above it.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""Sam's drawing""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""it"" does not refer to ""Sam's drawing"".   The correct interpretation is that ""it"" refers to the arrangement of the drawings, implying that the addition of another drawing would make it look better with Sam's drawing. This is supported by the phrase ""above it"", which indicates that ""it"" is referring to the existing arrangement of the drawings."	75	
1760478152	1760478152	"The table won't fit through the doorway because it is too wide.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""The table""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""it"" refers to ""The table"". The reason is that the sentence is in the nominative case, and the subject of the sentence is ""The table"". In this context, ""it"" is a pronoun that is used as a subject, referring back to the subject ""The table"". This is a common grammatical pattern in English, where the subject is replaced with a pronoun for simplicity or emphasis."	87	
1760478152	1760478153	"Emma Emma's mother had died long ago, and her education had been managed by an excellent woman as governess.  In the sentence above, does ""her"" refer to ""Emma's mother""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""her"" in the sentence refers to ""Emma's mother"". The reason for this is that ""Emma"" is the subject of the sentence, and the pronoun ""her"" is the object of the verb ""had died"". The phrase ""Emma's mother"" is a noun phrase acting as a possessive appositive, providing additional information about the subject ""Emma"". This is a classic example of a relative pronoun (in this case, ""her"") referring back to a noun in the sentence."	105	
1760478153	1760478154	"Bill passed the gameboy to John because his turn was next.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""John""? Explain your choice."	"In this sentence, ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, which means it shows that something belongs to someone. However, in this context, ""his"" is not referring to John's belongings.  The word ""his"" is being used to indicate possession, but it's not referring to John's turn in the game. Instead, it's referring to Bill's turn, as in ""Bill's turn was next"".  So, ""his"" is actually referring to Bill, not John."	102	
1760478154	1760478155	"Of one thing Mark was sure. Harry knew much less than he did.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Harry""? Explain your choice."	"No, ""he"" does not refer to ""Harry"" in the sentence.   The sentence states ""Of one thing Mark was sure. Harry knew much less than he did."" The word ""he"" in the second part of the sentence refers to ""Mark"", not ""Harry"". This is because ""than"" is a comparative conjunction that indicates a comparison between two things, and ""less"" is the comparative form of ""less"". So, ""he"" refers to the thing being compared to Harry, which is Mark."	106	
1760478155	1760478155	"Do you suppose that Peter is responsible for the captain ’s illness? Maybe he bribed the cook to put something in his food.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""the captain""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""his"" refers to ""the captain"".   The reason for this is that ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, which means it shows that something belongs to someone. In this case, the sentence is implying that Peter might be the one responsible for the captain's illness, and ""his"" indicates that the illness belongs to or is associated with the captain."	79	
1760478155	1760478156	"What about the time you cut up tulip bulbs in the hamburgers because you thought they were onions?  In the sentence above, does ""they"" refer to ""hamburgers""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""they"" does not refer to ""hamburgers"". The word ""they"" is a pronoun, and it refers to the subject that performed the action of cutting up the tulip bulbs. In this context, the subject is implied to be the person who cut up the tulip bulbs, but it is not explicitly stated.   The word ""they"" is a plural pronoun that can refer to a group of people, but in this case, it is more likely referring to the person who cut up the tulip bulbs."	113	
1760478156	1760478157	"Fred covered his eyes with his hands , because the wind was blowing sand around. He lowered them when the wind stopped.  In the sentence above, does ""them"" refer to ""His eyes""? Explain your choice."	"No, in the sentence, ""them"" does not refer to ""His eyes"".  The reason is that ""his eyes"" is the subject of the sentence, and ""his eyes"" is a singular noun phrase. In this case, the verb ""lowered"" agrees with the singular subject ""his eyes"".  In English, when the verb agrees with a singular subject, it uses the singular form of the verb, even if the subject is a pronoun that refers to a plural noun. This is known as a ""subject-verb agreement"" rule.  In this case, the verb ""lowered"" agrees with the singular subject ""his eyes"", not the plural subject ""them""."	141	
1760478157	1760478158	"Sid explained his theory to Mark but he couldn't understand him.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Sid""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""he"" refers to ""Sid"". The pronoun ""he"" is in the subject position, and it agrees with the noun ""Sid"" in number (singular) and person (male)."	42	
1760478158	1760478159	"Tom gave Ralph a lift to school so he wouldn't have to drive alone.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Ralph""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""he"" can be both ""Tom"" and ""Ralph"", but the context and grammatical function suggest that ""he"" is more likely to refer to ""Tom"".  The reason for this is that the sentence structure is a simple verb phrase ""gave Ralph a lift"", where ""he"" is the subject of the verb ""gave"". The subject of the sentence is the one performing the action, which is ""Tom"", as indicated by the phrase ""Tom gave Ralph"".   In English, the pronoun ""he"" is typically used as a subject of a sentence, whereas ""Ralph"" is the object of the sentence, receiving the action. Therefore, the correct choice of ""he"" to refer to the subject of the sentence is ""Tom""."	160	
1760478159	1760478161	"When my parents died, I was not earning enough to keep myself or my crippled sister Nelly , and without our kind mistress , we would have gone to the poorhouse. Nelly calls her her angel and she has good right to do so. her  In the sentence above, does ""her"" refer to ""mistress""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence, ""her"" is not referring to ""mistress"". The correct analysis is as follows:  - The sentence says ""our kind mistress"", which indicates that ""mistress"" is referring to the person who took care of the speaker and their sister, i.e., a benefactor or a kind benefactress. - The pronoun ""her"" is then used to refer to this benefactress, not ""mistress"". The word ""mistress"" in this context has a different meaning, referring to the person who was in charge or had authority over the speaker and their sister. - The phrase ""good right"" is used to express the speaker's agreement that the benefactress has earned the right to be called an angel, implying that she has shown kindness and care towards the speaker and their sister.  So, in this sentence, ""her"" refers to the benefactress, not ""mistress""."	190	
1760478161	1760478162	"After I saw Bill catching flies and pulling off their wings, I boxed his ears. I showed the master the flies, some crushed and some crawling about helpless, and I showed him the wings on the window sill. I never saw him so angry before; but as Bill was still howling and whining, like the coward that he was, he did not give him any more punishment of that kind, but set him up on a stool for the rest of the afternoon, and said that he should not go out to play for that week.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""the master""? Explain your choice."	"In this sentence, ""he"" refers to ""Bill"".   This can be inferred from the context. The sentence mentions ""I showed the master the flies"" which suggests that ""the master"" is a separate entity from ""Bill"". The master is someone who is being shown the flies by the narrator, and the master's reaction is also described. Then, the sentence says ""but as Bill was still howling and whining"", which clearly indicates that the master is no longer the one being punished, but Bill is still being punished. Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" that follows must refer to Bill."	124	
1760478162	1760478162	"After I saw Bill catching flies and pulling off their wings, I boxed his ears. I showed the master the flies, some crushed and some crawling about helpless, and I showed him the wings on the window sill. I never saw him so angry before; but as Bill was still howling and whining, like the coward that he was, he did not give him any more punishment of that kind, but set him up on a stool for the rest of the afternoon, and said that he should not go out to play for that week.  In the sentence above, does ""him"" refer to ""the master""? Explain your choice."	"Yes, ""him"" in the sentence refers to ""Bill"".   This is because ""Bill"" is the subject of the previous sentence (""I showed the master...""), and the pronoun ""him"" is the object of the verb ""showed"" in the same sentence. The pronoun ""him"" is a direct object pronoun, which agrees in number and person with the subject ""Bill""."	82	
1760478162	1760478163	"Ann asked Mary what time the library closes, because she had forgotten.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Mary""? Explain your choice."	"In the sentence ""Ann asked Mary what time the library closes, because she had forgotten,"" ""she"" refers to ""Ann"".  The reason is that the subject of the sentence is ""Ann"", and ""she"" is a pronoun that agrees with the subject. The pronoun ""she"" is used to refer to the person who is performing the action of asking Mary, which is Ann."	81
