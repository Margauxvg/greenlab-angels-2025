1760601327	1760601327	Mark told Pete many lies about himself, which Pete included in his book. He should have been more skeptical.  In the sentence above, does "He" refer to "Mark"? Explain your choice.	Yes, "He" refers to "Mark".   This can be inferred because the sentence states "Mark told Pete many lies about himself". The pronoun "he" is in the subject position, referring back to the subject "Mark" mentioned in the previous clause. This is an example of a pronoun reference, where a pronoun (in this case "he") refers back to a noun (in this case "Mark") that was mentioned earlier in the sentence.
1760601327	1760601329	The mothers of Arthur and Celeste have come to the town to fetch them. They are very happy to have them back, but they scold them just the same because they ran away.  In the sentence above, does "them" refer to "mothers"? Explain your choice.	Yes, in the sentence "The mothers of Arthur and Celeste have come to the town to fetch them. They are very happy to have them back, but they scold them just the same because they ran away," "them" refers to "Arthur and Celeste".  This is because "them" is a pronoun that refers back to the subject of the previous clause, which is "Arthur and Celeste". In this context, "them" is used to refer to the two children, rather than the mothers. The phrase "The mothers of Arthur and Celeste" is a prepositional phrase that provides more information about who the mothers are, but it doesn't change the pronoun "them" that follows.
1760601329	1760601329	Mark was close to Mr. Singer 's heels. He heard him calling for the captain, promising him, in the jargon everyone talked that night, that not one thing should be damaged on the ship except only the ammunition, but the captain and all his crew had best stay in the cabin until the work was over  In the sentence above, does "He" refer to "Mr. Singer"? Explain your choice.	No, "He" does not refer to "Mr. Singer".   The pronoun "He" is used to refer to "Mark" in the sentence. The sentence states "Mark was close to Mr. Singer's heels", indicating that Mark is standing near Mr. Singer. The phrase "promising him" further emphasizes that the person Mark is referring to is Mr. Singer.
1760601329	1760601330	The pony behaved well, sir, and showed no vice; but at last he just threw up his heels and tipped the young gentleman into the thorn hedge. He wanted me to help him out, but I hope you will excuse me, sir, I did not feel inclined to do so.  In the sentence above, does "He" refer to "young gentleman"? Explain your choice.	In this sentence, "he" is likely referring to the pony, not the "young gentleman".   The context suggests that the pony is the one that threw the young gentleman into the thorn hedge. The phrase "He wanted me to help him out" implies that the pony, which is the subject of the previous action, is now in need of help, and the speaker is being asked to assist it. The use of the pronoun "he" to refer to the pony is a common way to use a pronoun to refer to an animal, especially in informal or old-fashioned writing.  The "young gentleman" is more likely the person who was thrown into the hedge, and is being addressed by the speaker.
1760601330	1760601331	I poured water from the bottle into the cup until it was full.  In the sentence above, does "it" refer to "the cup"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence "I poured water from the bottle into the cup until it was full," "it" refers to "the cup."   This is because the sentence is structured as a dependent clause, "until it was full," which is a subordinate clause that modifies the main clause "I poured water from the bottle into the cup." The word "it" in this context is a pronoun that refers back to the noun "the cup" in the main clause. It indicates that the cup was full when the action of pouring was completed.
1760601331	1760601332	Dan had to stop Bill from toying with the injured bird. He is very compassionate.  In the sentence above, does "He" refer to "Dan"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence, "He" refers to "Dan". This is because the pronoun "He" is a he, referring to a male subject. The context of the sentence implies that Dan is the one who stopped Bill from toying with the injured bird. The sentence states "Dan had to stop Bill", which establishes Dan as the agent performing the action, making "He" a pronoun referring to Dan.
1760601332	1760601333	Sam Goodman 's biography of the Spartan general Xenophanes conveys a vivid sense of the difficulties he faced in his childhood.  In the sentence above, does "he" refer to "Goodman"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence, "he" does not refer to "Goodman". The correct pronoun to use would be "he" should be replaced with "Xenophanes". The pronoun "he" is referring to the Spartan general Xenophanes, not Sam Goodman.  The correct sentence would be: "Sam Goodman's biography of the Spartan general Xenophanes conveys a vivid sense of the difficulties he faced in his childhood."
1760601333	1760601333	Pam's parents came home and found her having sex with her boyfriend, Paul. They were furious about it.  In the sentence above, does "They" refer to "Pam's parents"? Explain your choice.	Yes, in the sentence "Pam's parents came home and found her having sex with her boyfriend, Paul. They were furious about it," "They" refers to "Pam's parents".  This is because "They" is a pronoun that agrees with the subject "Pam's parents" in number (plural). The verb "were furious" is also in the plural form, which confirms that "They" refers to the parents, not a single person.
1760601333	1760601334	Bob paid for Charlie 's college education, but now Charlie acts as though it never happened. He is very hurt.  In the sentence above, does "He" refer to "Bob"? Explain your choice.	Yes, "He" refers to "Bob". The pronoun "He" is a subject pronoun that refers to the person who performed the action in the sentence. In this case, the action is "paid for Charlie's college education", and the subject of that action is Bob. The sentence implies that Bob is the one who paid for Charlie's education, so "He" logically refers to Bob.
1760601334	1760601335	Billy cried because Toby wouldn't share his toy.  In the sentence above, does "his" refer to "Toby"? Explain your choice.	Yes, in the sentence "Billy cried because Toby wouldn't share his toy," the pronoun "his" refers to "Toby."  This is because "his" is a possessive pronoun, which indicates that the toy belongs to Toby. The phrase "wouldn't share" is a verb phrase, and "his" is the object of the verb "wouldn't." In this context, "his" is agreeing with the noun "toy," showing that the toy belongs to Toby.
1760601335	1760601336	Emma did not pass the ball to Janie although she was open.  In the sentence above, does "she" refer to "Janie"? Explain your choice.	No, "she" does not refer to "Janie". The pronoun "she" is used to refer to Emma, who is the subject of the sentence. The sentence states that Emma did not pass the ball to Janie, but the pronoun "she" is used to describe Emma's action.  The pronoun "her" would be used if the sentence said "Janie did not pass the ball to her", which would imply that Janie is the one who did not pass the ball.
1760601336	1760601336	Sam's drawing was hung just above Tina's and it did look much better with another one below it.  In the sentence above, does "it" refer to "Sam's drawing"? Explain your choice.	No, "it" does not refer to "Sam's drawing".   The sentence "Sam's drawing was hung just above Tina's" establishes that "Tina's" is the one whose drawing is being referred to in the following phrase "and it did look much better with another one below it". The word "it" is a pronoun that refers back to "Tina's drawing".
1760601336	1760601337	Bob paid for Charlie 's college education, but now Charlie acts as though it never happened. He is very ungrateful.  In the sentence above, does "He" refer to "Bob"? Explain your choice.	Yes, "He" refers to "Bob".   The pronoun "He" is a subject pronoun, which refers to the person performing the action described by the verb. In this sentence, "He" is used as a subject pronoun, referring to the person performing the action of paying for Charlie's college education, which is Bob.
1760601337	1760601337	The lawyer asked the witness a question, but he was reluctant to answer it.  In the sentence above, does "he" refer to "the lawyer"? Explain your choice.	Yes, "he" refers to "the lawyer".   The reason is that in the sentence, there is no other male noun mentioned in the same sentence as "he", so it can be inferred that "he" is referring to the lawyer.
1760601337	1760601338	Sam took French classes from Adam , because he was eager to speak it fluently.  In the sentence above, does "he" refer to "Sam"? Explain your choice.	Yes, "he" refers to "Sam". The pronoun "he" is a subject pronoun, and in this sentence, it is used to refer back to the subject of the sentence, which is "Sam". This is an example of a pronoun reference, where a pronoun is used to replace a noun, and in this case, "he" is used to refer to the noun "Sam".
1760601338	1760601339	Sid explained his theory to Mark but he couldn't convince him.  In the sentence above, does "he" refer to "Mark"? Explain your choice.	No, "he" does not refer to "Mark".   The sentence "Sid explained his theory to Mark but he couldn't convince him" is an example of a pronoun antecedent ambiguity. In this case, "he" can refer to either "Sid" or "Mark".  The pronoun "he" is used after the phrase "but he couldn't convince him", which suggests that the subject of the verb "couldn't convince" is actually "him", not "he". Therefore, "he" refers to "Mark".
1760601339	1760601340	The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence.  In the sentence above, does "they" refer to "The demonstrators"? Explain your choice.	Yes, "they" refers to "The demonstrators".   The pronoun "they" is a plural pronoun, and it agrees with the plural subject "demonstrators" in number. The sentence states that "The demonstrators" were refused a permit because they advocated violence, indicating that it was "The demonstrators" who were advocating violence, and therefore, "they" refers back to this group.
1760601340	1760601340	When Tommy dropped his ice cream, Timmy giggled, so father gave him a sympathetic look.  In the sentence above, does "him" refer to "Timmy"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence, "him" is actually referring to "Tommy". The reason is that the subject of the sentence is "Tommy" and the verb "dropped" is in the third person singular form (he/dropped), which typically takes the object pronoun "him" when referring back to the subject.  In other words, the sentence is saying that Tommy dropped his ice cream, and then Timmy's reaction (giggling) is what prompted the father's response.
1760601340	1760601342	After I saw Bill catching flies and pulling off their wings, I boxed his ears. I showed the master the flies, some crushed and some crawling about helpless, and I showed him the wings on the window sill. I never saw him so angry before; but as Bill was still howling and whining, like the coward that he was, he did not give him any more punishment of that kind, but set him up on a stool for the rest of the afternoon, and said that he should not go out to play for that week.  In the sentence above, does "he" refer to "the master"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence, "he" refers to "Bill". This is because the context suggests that "he" is referring to the person who was caught catching and pulling off the flies' wings, which is Bill.  The sentence "I showed the master the flies" is an aside, indicating that the narrator is showing the master the flies, but the main action of catching and pulling off the wings is attributed to Bill. The use of "he" to refer to Bill is a direct reference to the action being described in the previous sentence, and it is not a reference to the master.  The phrase "as Bill was still howling and whining" further supports this interpretation, as it is Bill's reaction to the punishment that is being described, rather than the master's reaction.
1760601342	1760601343	The journalists interviewed the stars of the new movie. They were very cooperative, so the interview lasted for a long time.  In the sentence above, does "They" refer to "The journalists"? Explain your choice.	No, "They" does not refer to "The journalists". The subject of the sentence is "the stars of the new movie", and "they" refers to the stars of the movie.  The pronoun "they" is used to refer to the stars of the movie, which is a plural noun. This is because the stars are a group of people, and the plural pronoun "they" is used to refer to a group of people.  The journalists are the ones who are doing the interviewing, so they are referred to by the subject pronoun "the journalists" or "the interviewers".
1760601343	1760601343	Joan made sure to thank Susan for all the help she had given.  In the sentence above, does "she" refer to "Susan"? Explain your choice.	No, "she" does not refer to "Susan" in the sentence. The pronoun "she" is used to refer to Joan, who is the subject of the sentence. The sentence states "Joan made sure to thank Susan for all the help she had given." The use of "she" in this context is a pronoun referring back to Joan, indicating that it was Joan who made sure to thank Susan.
1760601343	1760601344	In the storm, the tree fell down and crashed through the roof of my house. Now, I have to get it repaired.  In the sentence above, does "it" refer to "The roof"? Explain your choice.	In this sentence, "it" refers to "The roof".   The pronoun "it" is used here to refer back to "the tree" that fell down, which is the subject of the previous sentence. This is an example of a pronoun referring back to a specific noun, known as a "referring pronoun" or "back-reference".
1760601344	1760601345	Beth didn't get angry with Sally , who had cut her off, because she stopped and counted to ten.  In the sentence above, does "she" refer to "Beth"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence, "she" refers to "Sally". The reason for this is that the subject of the sentence is "Beth" who is doing the counting, but the one being cut off is Sally. The pronoun "she" is used to refer to Sally in this context.
1760601345	1760601345	The lawyer asked the witness a question, but he was reluctant to repeat it.  In the sentence above, does "he" refer to "the lawyer"? Explain your choice.	Yes, "he" refers to "the lawyer". The pronoun "he" is a masculine singular pronoun, and in this context, it is clearly referring to the male person being described as "the lawyer".
1760601345	1760601346	Sir Clifford wants me to find him a new groom , about twenty or twenty-one, who knows his business. His old coachman is getting feeble, and he wants a man to work with him and get into his ways, who would be able, when the old man was pensioned off, to step into his place  In the sentence above, does "his" refer to "new groom"? Explain your choice.	No, "his" in the sentence does not refer to "new groom".  The pronoun "his" is a possessive pronoun, and in this context, it refers to the old coachman. The sentence states that the old coachman is getting feeble, which implies that he is the one who will be pensioned off. Therefore, "his" is referring to the old coachman's things or possessions, not the new groom.
1760601346	1760601346	Since it was raining, I carried the newspaper over my backpack to keep it dry.  In the sentence above, does "it" refer to "The newspaper"? Explain your choice.	In this sentence, "it" refers to "the newspaper".   The pronoun "it" is used to refer back to the noun "newspaper" that was previously mentioned in the sentence. This is an example of a pronoun "it" referring back to a noun, often called a "referring pronoun".
1760601346	1760601348	If the con artist has succeeded in fooling Sam , he would have gotten a lot of money.  In the sentence above, does "he" refer to "The con artist"? Explain your choice.	Yes, in the sentence, "he" refers to "The con artist".   The reason is that the subject of the sentence is "the con artist", and "he" is a pronoun that refers back to this subject. The verb "would have gotten" is in the past tense, which suggests a completed action, and "he" is the subject of the verb.   In this context, "he" is a pronoun used as a subject, not an object. If "he" were an object, the sentence would likely use a different pronoun, such as "the con artist" (e.g., "The con artist would have fooled Sam"), or a possessive pronoun, such as "his" (e.g., "The con artist's success would have fooled Sam").
1760601348	1760601348	The boy continued to whip the pony , and eventually the pony threw him over. John laughed out quite loud. "Served him right," he said.  In the sentence above, does "him" refer to "pony"? Explain your choice.	No, "him" in the sentence does not refer to "pony".   The sentence is a fragment of a narrative, but the context implies that John had been riding the pony and got thrown off. In this case, "him" refers to John, the person who was riding the pony. The phrase "served him right" is a common idiomatic expression meaning "deserved what he got", which in this context suggests that John's actions (whipping the pony) had consequences, and he got thrown off.
1760601348	1760601350	I put the cake away in the refrigerator . It has a lot of leftovers in it.  In the sentence above, does "It" refer to "The cake"? Explain your choice.	Yes, "It" in the sentence "I put the cake away in the refrigerator. It has a lot of leftovers in it." refers to "the cake".  This is because "I put the cake away in the refrigerator" is the first part of the sentence, and "It" is a pronoun that refers back to the noun "cake" that was mentioned in the previous clause. This is called a pronoun reference, where a pronoun is used to replace a noun.  In this case, "It" is the subject of the second clause "It has a lot of leftovers in it", and it clearly refers to the same noun "cake" as the first part of the sentence.
1760601350	1760601350	The fish ate the worm . It was tasty.  In the sentence above, does "It" refer to "The worm"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence, "It" is a pronoun that refers back to "The fish".   The reason is that "It" is the subject of the sentence, and it is performing the action of eating the worm. The word "The fish" is the subject of the sentence, and "It" is a pronoun that replaces the noun "The fish" to make the sentence more concise and easier to read.  So, "It" refers back to "The fish", indicating that the fish is the one that ate the worm.
1760601350	1760601351	Babar wonders how he can get new clothing. Luckily, a very rich old man who has always been fond of little elephants understands right away that he is longing for a fine suit. As he likes to make people happy, he gives him his wallet.  In the sentence above, does "he" refer to "Babar"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence, "he" refers to "Babar". This is because the sentence uses a pronoun "he" to replace the noun "Babar" in the phrase "he gives him his wallet". The pronoun "he" is referring back to the subject "Babar" in the previous clause, indicating that the rich old man is giving the wallet to Babar.
1760601351	1760601351	The actress used to be named Terpsichore , but she changed it to Tina a few years ago, because she figured it was easier to pronounce.  In the sentence above, does "it" refer to "Terpsichore"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence, "it" refers to "Terpsichore".   This is because the subject of the sentence is "The actress", and the pronoun "it" is used to refer back to the subject, which is "Terpsichore".
1760601351	1760601353	So Mark slept. It was daylight when he woke with Warren 's hand upon his shoulder.  In the sentence above, does "his" refer to "Warren"? Explain your choice.	No, "his" does not refer to "Warren" in this sentence. The reason is that "his" is a possessive adjective, indicating that the noun it modifies (in this case, "shoulder") belongs to someone else. However, in this sentence, "shoulder" is not the object of the sentence. The phrase "Warren's hand" is a possessive noun phrase, and the pronoun "his" is not directly modifying "shoulder".  In fact, the correct interpretation of the sentence is that "his" is referring to the shoulder of the person who is not mentioned in the sentence, i.e., Mark's shoulder. This is an example of a pronoun "his" being used as a possessive pronoun, referring to the shoulder of Mark, not Warren.
1760601353	1760601354	Fred covered his eyes with his hands , because the wind was blowing sand around. He lowered them when the wind stopped.  In the sentence above, does "them" refer to "His hands"? Explain your choice.	No, "them" does not refer to "His hands". In the sentence, "them" is a pronoun that refers to the object of the preposition "around", which is the sand. The sentence is saying that the wind was blowing sand around "them" (the sand). The use of "them" in this context is a singular, objective pronoun, which is often used to refer to an inanimate object or a general group of things.
1760601354	1760601354	Sir Clifford wants me to find him a new groom , about twenty or twenty-one, who knows his business. His old coachman is getting feeble, and he wants a man to work with him and get into his ways, who would be able, when the old man was pensioned off, to step into his place  In the sentence above, does "his" refer to "old coachman"? Explain your choice.	Yes, "his" refers to "old coachman".   The reason is that "his" is a possessive adjective, which indicates that it shows ownership or relationship. In this sentence, it is used to describe the coachman as something that belongs to Sir Clifford. The sentence is saying that Sir Clifford is looking for a new groom to work with his old coachman, implying that the coachman is Sir Clifford's employee or servant.
1760601354	1760601355	Joe paid the detective after he delivered the final report on the case.  In the sentence above, does "he" refer to "Joe"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence, "he" refers to "Joe". The pronoun "he" is a subject pronoun that agrees with the noun "Joe", which is the subject of the sentence. In this context, "he" is used to refer back to the subject of the sentence, which is the person performing the action described in the sentence (delivering the final report).
1760601355	1760601356	As Andrea in the crop duster passed over Susan , she could see the landing strip.  In the sentence above, does "she" refer to "Susan"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence, "she" does not refer to "Susan". The sentence is referring to the person operating the crop duster, who is not explicitly stated to be Susan. The pronoun "she" is a general pronoun, referring to a female person, but it doesn't have a specific reference to Susan. The sentence is simply stating that as Andrea (the person operating the crop duster) passed over Susan, and then she (the person operating the crop duster) could see the landing strip.
1760601356	1760601357	Frank was upset with Tom because the toaster he had bought from him didn't work.  In the sentence above, does "he" refer to "Tom"? Explain your choice.	Yes, in the sentence "Frank was upset with Tom because the toaster he had bought from him didn't work," "he" refers to "Tom".  This is because the pronoun "he" is a direct object pronoun that agrees with the noun "Tom" in the sentence. The word "him" is the object of the verb "bought", which is a direct object. In English, when a pronoun follows a verb in this way, it is called an object pronoun, and it agrees with the noun it replaces. In this case, "he" agrees with "Tom" in number (singular) and person (first person, referring to the person who bought the toaster).
1760601357	1760601358	Lily spoke to Donna , breaking her silence.  In the sentence above, does "her" refer to "Donna"? Explain your choice.	Yes, in the sentence "Lily spoke to Donna, breaking her silence", the pronoun "her" refers to "Donna".  The reason for this is that "her" is a possessive adjective, which is used to show that something belongs to a specific person or group. In this case, the verb "silence" is being acted upon by Donna, so "her" is the possessive form of the word "silence" that indicates that it is Donna's silence that is being broken.
1760601358	1760601359	The cat was lying by the mouse hole waiting for the mouse , but it was too cautious.  In the sentence above, does "it" refer to "The cat"? Explain your choice.	Yes, "it" in the sentence refers to "The cat".   The pronoun "it" is a subject pronoun, and in this context, it is used to refer back to the noun "The cat" that was previously mentioned in the sentence. This is an example of anaphoric reference, where the pronoun "it" is used to refer to a specific noun that was previously mentioned in the sentence.  In other words, the sentence is saying that "The cat" was lying by the mouse hole, and then "it" refers back to "The cat" to emphasize that the cat is the one waiting by the mouse hole.
1760601359	1760601359	Equally swoon-worthy is C.K. Dexter Haven , a pallid young dandy holding a jade-handled walking stick, with a poodle asleep at his feet  In the sentence above, does "his" refer to "Haven"? Explain your choice.	No, in the sentence, "his" does not refer to "Haven".   The correct interpretation is that "his" refers to the poodle. The possessive pronoun "his" is used to indicate that the walking stick belongs to the poodle.
1760601359	1760601360	Sir Clifford wants me to find him a new groom , about twenty or twenty-one, who knows his business. His old coachman is getting feeble, and he wants a man to work with him and get into his ways, who would be able, when the old man was pensioned off, to step into his place.  In the sentence above, does "his" refer to "Sir Clifford"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence, "his" refers to "the groom".   This is because the context of the sentence indicates that Sir Clifford is looking for a new groom, not a new groomer or someone to groom Sir Clifford. The word "groom" in this context refers to a male servant or attendant who is responsible for the care and management of a horse, as in Sir Clifford's case.
1760601360	1760601361	The fish ate the worm . It was tasty.  In the sentence above, does "It" refer to "The fish"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence "The fish ate the worm. It was tasty.", "It" refers to "The worm".  The reason is that "It" is a pronoun, and it is used as the subject of the second clause "It was tasty." In this case, "It" is referring back to "the worm" from the first clause "The fish ate the worm." The subject of the first clause "The fish" is a different noun, so it doesn't match with "It".  This type of pronoun reference is called a "pronoun antecedent" or "pronoun reference", where a pronoun is used to refer back to a noun from a previous clause.
1760601361	1760601362	Lionel is holding captive a scientist, Dr. Vardi , who has invented a device that turns animals invisible; Lionel plans to use it on Geoffrey and send him to steal nuclear material from an army vault.  In the sentence above, does "him" refer to "Lionel"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence, "him" refers to "Geoffrey".   The reason for this is that the sentence is in the third person, and the subject of the sentence is "Lionel", who is performing the action of holding captive Dr. Vardi. The pronoun "him" is used as the object of the preposition "by", which is a direct object.   In this context, "him" is the indirect object of the verb "hold", and it refers to the person being held captive, which is Dr. Vardi. However, since Dr. Vardi is not the main focus of the sentence, and the sentence is about Lionel's plan to use the device on Geoffrey, "him" is referring to Geoffrey.
1760601362	1760601363	The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence.  In the sentence above, does "they" refer to "The city councilmen"? Explain your choice.	In this sentence, "they" actually refers to "the demonstrators". The reason is that "they" is the subject of the sentence, and the demonstrators are the ones who are refusing the permit. The city councilmen are the object of the action, not the ones performing the action.  The subject-verb agreement rules in English state that when the subject is a plural noun (demonstrators), the verb should also be in the plural form (fear). This is why "fear" is used instead of "fear" to agree with the plural subject "demonstrators".
1760601363	1760601364	Frank felt vindicated when his longtime rival Bill revealed that he was the winner of the competition.  In the sentence above, does "he" refer to "Bill"? Explain your choice.	No, in the sentence "Frank felt vindicated when his longtime rival Bill revealed that he was the winner of the competition," "he" refers to "Frank".   The reason is that the phrase "his longtime rival" is a possessive phrase describing Bill, indicating that Bill is the one who is the rival of Frank. So, the pronoun "he" that follows "Bill" must refer back to Frank, as it is the subject of the sentence.
1760601364	1760601365	Bob collapsed on the sidewalk. Soon he saw Carl coming to help. He was very concerned.  In the sentence above, does "He" refer to "Bob"? Explain your choice.	Yes, "He" refers to "Bob". The pronoun "He" is the subject of the sentence, and the verb "was coming" indicates that the action is related to "He". In this context, "He" is clearly referring to Bob, the person who collapsed on the sidewalk.
1760601365	1760601365	Dan took the rear seat while Bill claimed the front because his "Dibs!" was slow.  In the sentence above, does "his" refer to "Bill"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence, "his" is used to refer to "Bill". This is because "his" is a possessive adjective, indicating that the "dibs" (a claim or a right) belongs to Bill. The word "his" is directly connected to the noun "dibs", which is Bill's claim.
1760601365	1760601366	Susan knows all about Ann 's personal problems because she is nosy.  In the sentence above, does "she" refer to "Susan"? Explain your choice.

1760601366	1760601366	Pete envies Martin because he is very successful.  In the sentence above, does "he" refer to "Pete"? Explain your choice.	No, "he" does not necessarily refer to "Pete". The sentence only indicates that "Pete" envies Martin because he is very successful. The pronoun "he" is referring to Martin, not Pete. The structure of the sentence implies that the subject performing the action of envying (Martin) is not explicitly stated, but the sentence is focusing on why Pete envies Martin, which is Martin's success.
1760601366	1760601367	Billy cried because Toby wouldn't share his toy.  In the sentence above, does "his" refer to "Billy"? Explain your choice.	Yes, "his" refers to "Billy". The reason is that "Billy" is a proper noun (a person's name), and in this context, the possessive pronoun "his" is used to show ownership. The sentence is saying that Billy is upset because Toby won't share something that belongs to him (Billy).
1760601367	1760601368	I poured water from the bottle into the cup until it was full.  In the sentence above, does "it" refer to "the bottle"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence "I poured water from the bottle into the cup until it was full," "it" refers to the cup.  The reason for this is that the sentence is structured as a subordinate clause, starting with "until," which is a subordinating conjunction. This means that "until" indicates a condition or a point in time, rather than a direct object. In this case, "until" is introducing a clause that describes the condition of the cup being full.  In the subordinate clause "until it was full," "it" refers back to the cup, not the bottle. The sentence is saying "I poured water from the bottle into the cup until the cup was full." The phrase "until it was full" is a dependent clause, and "it" in this context refers to the cup, indicating that the cup was full when the pouring was stopped.
1760601368	1760601370	I used an old rag to clean the knife , and then I put it in the trash.  In the sentence above, does "it" refer to "The knife"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence, "it" refers to "the knife". The reason is that "it" is the pronoun that directly follows the noun "knife", which is the main noun in the sentence. The sentence can be analyzed as follows:  - "I used an old rag" refers to the object (the rag) - "to clean the knife" indicates the action being performed on the knife - "and then I put it in the trash" indicates what was done with the object (the rag) after cleaning the knife  The pronoun "it" here refers back to the object (the rag), not the knife. If the sentence had been "I used an old rag to clean the knife, and then I put the knife in the trash", then "it" would refer to the knife.
1760601370	1760601371	John hired Bill to take care of him .  In the sentence above, does "him" refer to "Bill"? Explain your choice.	No, "him" does not refer to "Bill" in the sentence.   The pronoun "him" is the object of the verb "hired", which is in the active voice. The subject of the sentence is "John", and "him" is the object of the verb "hired". In this case, "him" refers to the person John hired, which is Bill.  The correct analysis would be:  * John (subject) is the one performing the action of hiring. * Bill (object) is the one being hired. * "Him" (object) is the pronoun that refers to Bill, the person being hired.
1760601371	1760601371	Jane knocked on the door, and Susan answered it. She invited her to come out.  In the sentence above, does "She" refer to "Jane"? Explain your choice.	No, "She" does not refer to "Jane" in this sentence. The pronoun "She" is used to refer to "Susan", as indicated by the fact that Susan is the one who is answering the door. The subject of the sentence is "Jane", but the one performing the action (knocking on the door) is Susan, so "She" is used to refer to her.
1760601371	1760601373	The journalists interviewed the stars of the new movie. They were very persistent, so the interview lasted for a long time.  In the sentence above, does "They" refer to "The journalists"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence, "They" refers to "The journalists" because of a grammatical phenomenon called the "plural pronoun agreement rule". In this sentence, "They" is a plural pronoun, and it agrees with the plural noun "journalists".  In English, when a singular or plural subject is followed by a plural verb, the pronoun "they" is used. This rule applies in this case, where "journalists" (the plural subject) is followed by the plural verb "interviewed".  If the sentence were "The journalists were very persistent", the pronoun "they" would refer to "The journalists" in the same way. However, in this sentence, "They" is used instead of "They were", which is a verb phrase, to indicate the plural subject "journalists".
1760601373	1760601374	As Ollie carried Tommy up the long winding steps, his legs ached.  In the sentence above, does "his" refer to "Ollie"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence "As Ollie carried Tommy up the long winding steps, his legs ached," the pronoun "his" refers to "Ollie."  The reason is that "his" is a possessive pronoun that shows that the aching belongs to Ollie. The sentence implies that Ollie is the one whose legs are aching, not Tommy's. This is evident from the context, as Ollie is the one performing the action of carrying Tommy up the stairs.  If the sentence were saying "Tommy's legs ached," it would imply that Tommy is the one whose legs are aching, which doesn't match the context.
1760601374	1760601374	Carol believed that Rebecca regretted that she had stolen the watch.  In the sentence above, does "she" refer to "Rebecca"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence, "she" refers to "Carol".   The reason is that the sentence states "Carol believed that Rebecca regretted", which implies that Carol is the one doing the believing, and Rebecca is the one doing the regretting.
1760601374	1760601375	Bob paid for Charlie 's college education. He is very generous.  In the sentence above, does "He" refer to "Charlie"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence "Bob paid for Charlie's college education. He is very generous," "He" does not refer to "Charlie".  The reason is that "He" is a pronoun that refers back to a male noun in the previous clause, which is "Bob". The phrase "Charlie's college education" is a possessive noun phrase that shows ownership, but "He" is not referring to "Charlie" because it is describing Bob's actions, not Charlie's.  In this sentence, "He" is an example of a pronoun that is called a "relational pronoun", which refers to a person or thing that is related to the previous clause, but not necessarily the same person.
1760601375	1760601376	All the buttons up the back of Dora 's plaid dress were buttoned outside-in. Maude should have thought to button her up; but no, she had left poor little Dora to do the best she could, alone.  In the sentence above, does "she" refer to "Dora"? Explain your choice.	Yes, "she" in the sentence refers to "Maude". The pronoun "she" is used to describe the subject of the sentence, which is Maude, the one who left Dora alone. The verb "had left" implies that Maude is the one responsible for the situation, and "she" is used as a subject pronoun to refer to her.
1760601376	1760601377	The table was piled high with food , and on the floor beside it there were crocks, baskets, and a five-quart pail of milk.  In the sentence above, does "it" refer to "floor"? Explain your choice.	In this sentence, "it" does not refer to "floor". The word "it" refers to "table". The sentence is describing the contents and surroundings of the table, and "it" is a pronoun that refers back to the table.  The sentence is structured as follows:  "The table was piled high with food... (description of the table)" "...and on the floor beside it (here 'it' refers back to the table)"  So, "it" is a pronoun that refers to the table, indicating that the food is beside the table, not on the floor.
1760601377	1760601378	Mark was close to Mr. Singer 's heels. He heard him calling for the captain , promising him, in the jargon everyone talked that night, that not one thing should be damaged on the ship except only the ammunition, but the captain and all his crew had best stay in the cabin until the work was over.  In the sentence above, does "his" refer to "Mark"? Explain your choice.	No, "his" does not refer to "Mark". In this sentence, "his" is possessive and refers to "the captain" (Mr. Singer). The word "his" is showing that the captain's belongings or property are being referred to, specifically the crew.  The sentence is describing the captain's instructions to Mark, and "his" is used to indicate that the captain is the one who owns the crew.
1760601378	1760601378	The man lifted the boy onto his shoulders.  In the sentence above, does "his" refer to "The boy"? Explain your choice.	Yes, "his" refers to "The boy" in this sentence.  This is because "the boy" is a singular noun, and "his" is a possessive adjective. In this context, "his" is showing possession, indicating that the boy belongs to the man.
1760601378	1760601379	Do you suppose that Peter is responsible for the captain ’s illness? Maybe he bribed the cook to put something in his food.  In the sentence above, does "his" refer to "Peter"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence, "his" refers to "the captain". The reason is that "his" is the possessive form of the pronoun "he", which is used to show ownership or relationship. In this context, "his" indicates that the illness belongs to or affects the captain, not Peter.
1760601379	1760601380	The signs over the shops' doors had pictures that indicated what work was done inside. Although more and more people were learning how to read, each artisan still had signs, not wishing to lose a possible patron merely because he happened to be illiterate.  In the sentence above, does "he" refer to "patron"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence, "he" refers to "artisan". The pronoun "he" is a subject pronoun, which is a type of pronoun that refers to a person performing the action of the verb. In this case, the verb is "was", which is in the past tense, and "he" is the subject of the verb.   Additionally, the sentence structure also suggests that "he" is referring to the artisan, as it comes after the phrase "each artisan", which is a noun phrase that refers to the artisans. The phrase "not wishing to lose a possible patron merely because he happened to be illiterate" is also more logically connected to "he" as the subject, rather than "patron", since the idea of someone being illiterate would be more closely related to the artisan's identity.
1760601380	1760601381	Paul tried to call George on the phone, but he wasn't available.  In the sentence above, does "he" refer to "George"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence, "he" is a pronoun that refers to Paul. This is because the sentence states "Paul tried to call George", and "he" is a subject pronoun, indicating the person performing the action (trying to call). The sentence is using the pronoun "he" to refer back to the person who is trying to call George, which is Paul.
1760601381	1760601382	Sam's drawing was hung just above Tina's and it did look much better with another one above it.  In the sentence above, does "it" refer to "Sam's drawing"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence, "it" refers to "Sam's drawing". This is because the sentence structure implies that "it" is describing the subject that was previously mentioned, which is "Sam's drawing". The use of "just above" and "much better with" also suggests a causal relationship between the two drawings, implying that Sam's drawing is being described in relation to its position above Tina's drawing.  Additionally, the pronoun "it" is a direct object of the verb "hung", which is a strong indicator that "it" refers to the subject "Sam's drawing".
1760601382	1760601382	The table won't fit through the doorway because it is too wide.  In the sentence above, does "it" refer to "The table"? Explain your choice.	Yes, in the sentence "The table won't fit through the doorway because it is too wide", "it" refers to "The table".  This is because the sentence is using a pronoun "it" to replace the noun "The table" in the phrase "The table won't fit through the doorway because it is too wide". The pronoun "it" is used to refer back to the subject of the sentence, which is "The table". The reason for this is that "it" is being used to refer to a specific, previously mentioned noun, which is "The table".
1760601382	1760601384	Emma Emma's mother had died long ago, and her education had been managed by an excellent woman as governess.  In the sentence above, does "her" refer to "Emma's mother"? Explain your choice.	In this sentence, "her" refers to "Emma". The reason for this is that the sentence is in the past perfect tense, and the verb "had been managed" is in the past perfect tense, which indicates that the action of managing Emma's education took place before the main action of the sentence (i.e., Emma's death).  In the past perfect tense, the verb "had been" is used to show that an action started and continued up to a specific point in the past, and then another action happened after that point. In this case, "had been managed" indicates that the education was managed before Emma's mother's death, and then her mother died.  So, the sentence is saying that Emma's mother had been managing her education before she died, and now Emma is the one who is being referred to.
1760601384	1760601385	Bill passed the gameboy to John because his turn was next.  In the sentence above, does "his" refer to "John"? Explain your choice.	In this sentence, "his" is a possessive pronoun, which means it shows that something belongs to someone. However, in this context, "his" is not referring to John's belongings.  The word "his" is being used to indicate possession, but it's not referring to John's turn. Instead, it's referring to Bill, indicating that the gameboy belongs to Bill. The correct interpretation is that Bill passed the gameboy to Bill (the owner), not John.  The word order and context suggest that the sentence means Bill is passing the gameboy to Bill, not John.
1760601385	1760601386	Of one thing Mark was sure. Harry knew much less than he did.  In the sentence above, does "he" refer to "Harry"? Explain your choice.	Yes, "he" refers to "Harry".   The sentence is a play on words, using the homophones "he" (the pronoun) and "he" (the possessive adjective). The word "he" in "one thing Mark was sure" is the pronoun, referring to the person doing the thinking.   The word "he" in "Harry knew much less than he" is the possessive adjective, referring to Harry, indicating that Harry knew less than someone else.
1760601386	1760601386	Do you suppose that Peter is responsible for the captain ’s illness? Maybe he bribed the cook to put something in his food.  In the sentence above, does "his" refer to "the captain"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence, "his" refers to "food". The reason is that the word "food" is the object being described, and "his" is a possessive adjective showing that the food belongs to someone. The sentence structure implies that Peter is suggesting that the cook added something to the food that made the captain ill, so "his" is clearly referring to the food, not the captain.
1760601386	1760601387	What about the time you cut up tulip bulbs in the hamburgers because you thought they were onions?  In the sentence above, does "they" refer to "hamburgers"?

The pronoun "they" is used to refer to the onions because the speaker is describing an action they took with those onions.
1760601387	1760601388	Fred covered his eyes with his hands , because the wind was blowing sand around. He lowered them when the wind stopped.  In the sentence above, does "them" refer to "His eyes"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence, "them" refers to "His eyes".   The reason for this is that "he lowered his eyes" is an idiomatic expression, meaning he lowered his own eyes, not the ones covered by his hands. In this context, "his eyes" is a pronoun referring back to the noun "his eyes" that were covered by his hands.  This is an example of a reflexive pronoun, which refers back to the subject of the sentence. In this case, the subject is "he", and "his eyes" is the noun that he is referring back to.
1760601388	1760601389	Sid explained his theory to Mark but he couldn't understand him.  In the sentence above, does "he" refer to "Sid"? Explain your choice.

In this case, "he" is the subject of the sentence "Sid explained his theory to Mark", and it refers back to the noun "Sid" in the first part of the sentence. This is an example of a pronoun referring back to a noun, known as a pronoun antecedent.
1760601389	1760601389	Tom gave Ralph a lift to school so he wouldn't have to drive alone.  In the sentence above, does "he" refer to "Ralph"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence "Tom gave Ralph a lift to school so he wouldn't have to drive alone," "he" refers to "Tom".   The reason is that "he" is the subject of the sentence, and it's in the nominative case, which is the standard form for subjects. The verb "gave" is in the past tense, and the pronoun "he" agrees with the subject "Tom" in person (he) and number (singular).
1760601389	1760601390	When my parents died, I was not earning enough to keep myself or my crippled sister Nelly , and without our kind mistress , we would have gone to the poorhouse. Nelly calls her her angel and she has good right to do so. her  In the sentence above, does "her" refer to "mistress"? Explain your choice.	No, "her" in the sentence does not refer to "mistress".  The pronoun "her" is referring to "Nelly". The reason for this is that the sentence is in the third person (using "she" and "her" to describe Nelly), and the possessive form of "Nelly" is "Nelly's", but in this case, it is "her" which is being used to refer to Nelly.
1760601390	1760601392	After I saw Bill catching flies and pulling off their wings, I boxed his ears. I showed the master the flies, some crushed and some crawling about helpless, and I showed him the wings on the window sill. I never saw him so angry before; but as Bill was still howling and whining, like the coward that he was, he did not give him any more punishment of that kind, but set him up on a stool for the rest of the afternoon, and said that he should not go out to play for that week.  In the sentence above, does "he" refer to "the master"? Explain your choice.	In this sentence, "he" refers to "Bill".   The reason is that the sentence structure and context indicate that "he" is describing Bill's actions and behavior, rather than the master's actions. The sentence says "I showed the master the flies", which implies that the speaker is showing the master the evidence of Bill's behavior. Then, the sentence continues with "but as Bill was still howling and whining", which directly attributes the actions to Bill, not the master.   The use of the word "Bill" immediately after "he" in the sentence also reinforces this interpretation. This kind of sentence structure is called a "paratactic construction", where two independent clauses are joined without conjunction, and the second clause is often set off by a comma, but still closely linked to the first clause. This construction can sometimes be confusing, but in this case, it clearly indicates that "he" refers to Bill.
1760601392	1760601392	After I saw Bill catching flies and pulling off their wings, I boxed his ears. I showed the master the flies, some crushed and some crawling about helpless, and I showed him the wings on the window sill. I never saw him so angry before; but as Bill was still howling and whining, like the coward that he was, he did not give him any more punishment of that kind, but set him up on a stool for the rest of the afternoon, and said that he should not go out to play for that week.  In the sentence above, does "him" refer to "the master"? Explain your choice.	In the sentence, "him" refers to "Bill".   The reason is that the pronoun "him" is in the accusative case, which is often used when the object of an action is being punished or being addressed directly. The context also supports this interpretation, as the speaker is showing the master the flies and the punishment they inflicted on Bill, implying that Bill is the one who was punished, not the master.
1760601392	1760601393	Ann asked Mary what time the library closes, because she had forgotten.  In the sentence above, does "she" refer to "Mary"? Explain your choice.	Yes, "she" in the sentence refers to "Mary".   This is because the sentence is in the nominative case, which is the case used for subjects. In this context, "Mary" is the subject of the sentence, performing the action of asking the question, and therefore "she" refers back to Mary.
