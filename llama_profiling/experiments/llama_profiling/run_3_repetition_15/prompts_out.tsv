1760529697	1760529700	Premise: No Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq Yet.  Hypothesis: Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"  No, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.  The premise states that no weapons of mass destruction have been found in Iraq yet, which implies that there is no evidence to suggest that such weapons exist in the country. On the other hand, the hypothesis states that weapons of mass destruction will be found in Iraq, which implies that there is evidence to suggest that such weapons do exist in the country.  These two statements are contradictory, and therefore, the hypothesis cannot logically follow from the premise. The absence of evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq does not imply that they will be found in the future, as the hypothesis suggests.  In logic, this is known as a ""negative premise"" and a ""affirmative conclusion,"" which is a classic example of a logical fallacy. The conclusion cannot logically follow from the premise because the premise denies the very thing that the conclusion claims to prove."	200	
1760529700	1760529701	Premise: A place of sorrow, after Pope John Paul II died, became a place of celebration, as Roman Catholic faithful gathered in downtown Chicago to mark the installation of new Pope Benedict XVI.  Hypothesis: Pope Benedict XVI is the new leader of the Roman Catholic Church.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that a place of sorrow became a place of celebration after Pope John Paul II died, which implies that a new Pope was installed. The hypothesis then states that the new Pope is Pope Benedict XVI, which is a logical conclusion given that he was the next in line of succession after Pope John Paul II.  Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise.	92	
1760529701	1760529704	Premise: Herceptin was already approved to treat the sickest breast cancer patients, and the company said, Monday, it will discuss with federal regulators the possibility of prescribing the drug for more breast cancer patients.  Hypothesis: Herceptin can be used to treat breast cancer.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Herceptin has already been approved to treat the sickest breast cancer patients. This implies that Herceptin has been proven to be effective in treating breast cancer in at least some patients.  The hypothesis then logically follows that Herceptin can be used to treat breast cancer in more patients, including those who are not as sick. This is because the efficacy of the drug has already been established in a subset of patients, and there is no reason to believe that it would not be effective in a broader population of breast cancer patients.  In other words, the premise provides a basis for inferring that Herceptin is effective in treating breast cancer, which in turn supports the hypothesis that it can be used to treat more breast cancer patients.	173	
1760529704	1760529705	Premise: Judie Vivian, chief executive at ProMedica, a medical service company that helps sustain the 2-year-old Vietnam Heart Institute in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), said that so far about 1,500 children have received treatment.  Hypothesis: The previous name of Ho Chi Minh City was Saigon.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise mentions Ho Chi Minh City, which is the current name of the city, while the hypothesis suggests that the city was previously called Saigon. These are two different names for the same city, and the hypothesis is incorrect. Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.	75	
1760529705	1760529708	Premise: A man is due in court later charged with the murder 26 years ago of a teenager whose case was the first to be featured on BBC One's Crimewatch. Colette Aram, 16, was walking to her boyfriend's house in Keyworth, Nottinghamshire, on 30 October 1983 when she disappeared. Her body was later found in a field close to her home. Paul Stewart Hutchinson, 50, has been charged with murder and is due before Nottingham magistrates later.  Hypothesis: Paul Stewart Hutchinson is accused of having stabbed a girl.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the hypothesis ""Paul Stewart Hutchinson is accused of having stabbed a girl"" follows logically from the premise.  The premise states that Paul Stewart Hutchinson has been charged with the murder of Colette Aram, a 16-year-old girl who disappeared while walking to her boyfriend's house in Keyworth, Nottinghamshire in 1983. The premise also mentions that Colette's body was later found in a field close to her home.  Given these facts, it is reasonable to infer that Colette was murdered, and that Paul Stewart Hutchinson is accused of having committed the crime. The act of stabbing someone is a common method of murder, and given the age and location of the victim, it is likely that the crime was committed in a violent and illegal manner. Therefore, the hypothesis ""Paul Stewart Hutchinson is accused of having stabbed a girl"" is a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the premise."	214	
1760529708	1760529710	Premise: Britain said, Friday, that it has barred cleric, Omar Bakri, from returning to the country from Lebanon, where he was released by police after being detained for 24 hours.  Hypothesis: Bakri was briefly detained, but was released.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Britain has barred Omar Bakri from returning to the country. This means that he was not allowed to enter Britain, which implies that he was detained at the border or upon arrival.  The hypothesis states that Bakri was briefly detained but was released. This is a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the premise, as it is likely that if Bakri was barred from returning to Britain, he would have been detained for a short period of time before being released.  Therefore, the hypothesis follows from the premise.	129	
1760529710	1760529713	Premise: Nearly 4 million children who have at least one parent who entered the U.S. illegally were born in the United States and are U.S. citizens as a result, according to the study conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center. That's about three quarters of the estimated 5.5 million children of illegal immigrants inside the United States, according to the study. About 1.8 million children of undocumented immigrants live in poverty, the study found.  Hypothesis: Three quarters of U.S. illegal immigrants have children.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that nearly 4 million children of undocumented immigrants were born in the United States and are U.S. citizens as a result. This means that these children have at least one parent who is an undocumented immigrant.  The hypothesis states that three quarters of U.S. illegal immigrants have children. Based on the premise, we know that nearly 4 million children of undocumented immigrants are U.S. citizens, which is equivalent to three quarters of the estimated 5.5 million children of illegal immigrants inside the United States.  Therefore, the hypothesis follows logically from the premise.	154	
1760529713	1760529715	Premise: Like the United States, U.N. officials are also dismayed that Aristide killed a conference called by Prime Minister Robert Malval in Port-au-Prince in hopes of bringing all the feuding parties together.  Hypothesis: Aristide had Prime Minister Robert Malval  murdered in Port-au-Prince.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"  No, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.  The premise states that U.N. officials are dismayed that Aristide killed a conference called by Prime Minister Robert Malval in Port-au-Prince. This implies that Aristide took action against the conference, but it does not necessarily imply that Aristide was responsible for Malval's death.  There could be many reasons why Aristide might have taken action against the conference, such as disagreeing with the agenda or wanting to prevent the conference from taking place. However, without additional information, it is not logical to conclude that Aristide was responsible for Malval's death.  Therefore, the hypothesis ""Aristide had Prime Minister Robert Malval murdered in Port-au-Prince"" is not supported by the given premise."	175	
1760529715	1760529717	Premise: WASHINGTON --  A newly declassified narrative of the Bush administration's advice to the CIA on harsh interrogations shows that the small group of Justice Department lawyers who wrote memos authorizing controversial interrogation techniques were operating not on their own but with direction from top administration officials, including then-Vice President Dick Cheney and national security adviser Condoleezza Rice. At the same time, the narrative suggests that then-Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and then-Secretary of State Colin Powell were largely left out of the decision-making process.  Hypothesis: Dick Cheney was the Vice President of Bush.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the hypothesis ""Dick Cheney was the Vice President of Bush"" follows from the premise.  The premise states that ""top administration officials, including then-Vice President Dick Cheney and national security adviser Condoleezza Rice"" were involved in directing the small group of Justice Department lawyers who wrote memos authorizing controversial interrogation techniques. Since Dick Cheney is mentioned specifically as one of the top administration officials involved, it logically follows that he was the Vice President of Bush."	112	
1760529717	1760529719	Premise: Only a week after it had no comment on upping the storage capacity of its Hotmail e-mail service, Microsoft early Thursday announced it was boosting the allowance to 250MB to follow similar moves by rivals such as Google, Yahoo, and Lycos.  Hypothesis: Microsoft's Hotmail has raised its storage capacity to 250MB.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Microsoft had no comment on upping the storage capacity of its Hotmail e-mail service just a week prior to the announcement of the increase to 250MB. This implies that Microsoft was considering or planning to increase the storage capacity of Hotmail, and the announcement of the increase a week later confirms that the hypothesis is true.  Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise.	102	
1760529719	1760529720	Premise: Lina Joy, 42, was born Azlina Jailani to Malay parents, and was raised as a Muslim. Malaysia's constitution guarantees freedom of religion, but by law, all ethnic Malays are Muslim. Joy converted to Christianity at age 26, and after some bureaucratic difficulties had her named legally changed in 1999. However, on her MyKad national ID, the National Registration Department retained her stated religion as Islam. In order to have her religion changed, the National Registration Department said Joy would have to obtain a certificate of apostasy from the Muslim Sharia Court.  Hypothesis: Lina Joy's parents are from Malaysia.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Lina Joy was born Azlina Jailani to Malay parents, and was raised as a Muslim. This means that Joy's parents are Malay and Muslim, which implies that they are from Malaysia. Therefore, the hypothesis that Joy's parents are from Malaysia follows logically from the premise.	84	
1760529720	1760529723	Premise: November 9, 1989 , the day the Berlin Wall fell and the world changed forever . Not even the most astute saw it coming . As Hungary's foreign minister in the late summer of 1989 , Gyula Horn gave the order to let visiting East Germans use his country to do a 400-mile end run around the Berlin Wall , a move now seen as the beginning of the end for hard-line communism in Europe .  Hypothesis: The Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that on November 9, 1989, the Berlin Wall fell, which marked a significant event in modern history. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989, which is a direct consequence of the events described in the premise.  Gyula Horn, Hungary's foreign minister, gave the order to let visiting East Germans use Hungary to do a 400-mile end run around the Berlin Wall, which effectively bypassed the wall and allowed East Germans to travel freely to the West. This move is now seen as the beginning of the end for hard-line communism in Europe, which ultimately led to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Therefore, the hypothesis that the Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989 logically follows from the premise.	196	1.0
1760529723	1760529726	"Premise: Valero Energy Corp., on Monday, said it found ""extensive"" additional damage at its 250,000-barrel-per-day Port Arthur refinery.  Hypothesis: Valero Energy Corp. produces 250,000 barrels per day.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"  No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Valero Energy Corp. found ""extensive"" additional damage at its Port Arthur refinery, but it does not mention the refinery's production capacity. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Valero Energy Corp. produces 250,000 barrels per day, which is a different piece of information.  While it is possible that the additional damage found at the Port Arthur refinery could impact the refinery's production capacity, the premise does not provide enough information to logically deduce that the refinery produces 250,000 barrels per day. Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise."	167	
1760529726	1760529728	Premise: Oil prices fall back as Yukos oil threat lifted  Hypothesis: Oil prices rise.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the premise.  The premise states that oil prices fell back as Yukos oil was lifted, which suggests that there was a decrease in the price of oil. However, the hypothesis states that oil prices will rise, which is a contradictory statement as the premise suggests that oil prices have already decreased.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. It is possible that other factors could be influencing oil prices, such as changes in global demand, geopolitical events, or supply chain disruptions, that could lead to fluctuations in oil prices regardless of the status of Yukos oil.	145	
1760529728	1760529730	Premise: Brian Brohm, the Louisville quarterback, threw for 368 yards and five touchdowns as the Cardinals beat visiting Oregon State 63-27.  Hypothesis: The quarterback threw for 413 yards and three touchdowns, and then ran to the end zone two more times.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Brian Brohm threw for 368 yards and five touchdowns, which is a specific and accurate statement about his performance in the game. However, the hypothesis states that he threw for 413 yards and three touchdowns, which is a different and inaccurate statement.  The hypothesis is not a logical consequence of the premise, as it implies that Brian Brohm had a higher yardage total and more touchdown passes than what the premise states. Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.	131	
1760529730	1760529731	"Premise: Greg Page, a former heavyweight boxing champion who suffered a severe brain injury in a 2001 fight, has died at 50. His wife Patricia said the one-time WBA champion had died at his home in Kentucky, USA, of complications related to injuries he suffered in the fight. Page was in a coma for a week after the 9 March 2001 fight against Dale Crowe which was stopped in the 10th round. Patricia Page said he was ""in a better place now"" after announcing on Monday he had died overnight in his sleep.  Hypothesis: Greg Page was a WBA champion.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise. The premise states that Greg Page was a former heavyweight boxing champion, and the word ""champion"" is often used to describe a person who has won a championship title in their respective sport. Therefore, it can be inferred that Greg Page was indeed a champion in the sport of boxing, specifically a WBA champion."	80	
1760529731	1760529732	"Premise: Sierra is likely to remain in jail at the Hillsborough County jail in her native Tampa until her next hearing on December 20, where she is being held without bail, which would prevent her attending the Washington event on Friday even if she still had permission to perform. Sierra has been in jail since the start of the month after an altercation with police officers outside a Tampa nightclub, which she had been ejected from. She is charged with disorderly intoxication and resisting arrest.  Hypothesis: Sierra once reached the finals of ""American Idol"".  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"  No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise provides information about Sierra's current situation, including her incarceration and upcoming hearing, but it does not provide any information about her past or her background, including whether she has reached the finals of ""American Idol"" in the past. The hypothesis is an unrelated statement that does not logically follow from the premise."	87	
1760529732	1760529736	Premise: Since 1987, however, Brazil has taken steps to dramatically reduce the destruction, including stepped-up enforcement and the elimination of tax incentives that led to large-scale land clearing.  Hypothesis: In the early 1990s Brazil began to take action to save the rainforest.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the hypothesis ""In the early 1990s Brazil began to take action to save the rainforest"" follows logically from the premise ""Since 1987, however, Brazil has taken steps to dramatically reduce the destruction, including stepped-up enforcement and the elimination of tax incentives that led to large-scale land clearing.""  The premise states that Brazil has been taking steps to reduce the destruction of the rainforest since 1987, which implies that the situation was not improving before that year. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Brazil began to take action to save the rainforest in the early 1990s, which is a specific time period after the action was initiated in 1987. This implies that the efforts to reduce destruction and protect the rainforest were successful and led to improved conditions in the early 1990s.  Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise, as it provides a specific time frame for when the action was taken to address the issue."	233	
1760529736	1760529738	"Premise: FIFA has received 11 bids to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments, an international football competition contested by the men's national teams. The countries vying to host the tournament are Australia, England, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Qatar, Russia, South Korea and United States, who have individual bids and the joint bids are from Belgium-Netherlands and Spain-Portugal.  Select bids are for 2018 and 2022 tournaments and two bids are just for the 2022 tournament. Qatar and South Korea are vying just for the 2022 tournament. The two winning bids will be chosen on December 2010 by the 24-man executive committee of FIFA.  Said FIFA president Sepp Blatter: ""We are very pleased about the fantastic level of interest in our flagship competition, with all initial bidders confirming their candidature.""  Hypothesis: Sepp Blatter is the president of FIFA.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  According to the premise, Sepp Blatter is quoted as saying, ""We are very pleased about the fantastic level of interest in our flagship competition, with all initial bidders confirming their candidature."" This suggests that Sepp Blatter is the president of FIFA, as he is the one making the statement about the level of interest in the World Cup and the confirmation of bids.  Therefore, the hypothesis can be logically deduced from the premise."	112	
1760529738	1760529740	Premise: U.S. crude settled $1.32 lower at $42.83 a barrel.  Hypothesis: Crude the light American lowered to the closing 1.32 dollars, to 42.83 dollars the barrel.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"  No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that ""U.S. crude settled $1.32 lower at $42.83 a barrel."" This implies that the price of U.S. crude oil decreased by $1.32 per barrel.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that ""Crude the light American lowered to the closing 1.32 dollars, to 42.83 dollars the barrel."" This suggests that the price of light American crude oil decreased to $42.83 per barrel, which is not the same as the price of U.S. crude oil decreasing by $1.32 per barrel.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise."	177	
1760529740	1760529743	Premise: WINNENDEN, Germany ―A teenage gunman killed 15 people, most of them female, on Wednesday in a rampage that began at a school near Stuttgart in southern Germany and ended in a nearby town, where he then killed himself after the police wounded him. The attack left Germany, which tightened tough gun controls after a similar attack at a school seven years ago, struggling to understand the carnage that had again befallen it, a country with relatively little violent crime. In 2002, a gunman killed 16 people before killing himself at a school in Erfurt, in eastern Germany.  Hypothesis: In 2002 near Stuttgart a boy shot 16 people.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that a teenage gunman killed 15 people in a rampage that began at a school near Stuttgart and ended in a nearby town, and that the attacker then killed himself after being wounded by the police. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that a boy shot 16 people in 2002 near Stuttgart. These are two different events, and the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.  While the premise mentions an attack in 2002 near Stuttgart, it does not provide any information about the perpetrator's identity or the number of people killed. The hypothesis, however, specifically states that a boy shot 16 people, which is not consistent with the information provided in the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.	189	
1760529743	1760529746	Premise: Many hopes are riding on the sale of Talisman's holdings in Palm Beach and Hendry counties, which Vice President Al Gore announced with much fanfare last year at the 50th anniversary of Everglades National Park.  Hypothesis: Everglades National Park is located in Florida.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the hypothesis ""Everglades National Park is located in Florida"" follows from the premise.  The premise states that Vice President Al Gore announced the sale of Talisman's holdings in Palm Beach and Hendry counties, which are both located in Florida. Therefore, it can be inferred that Everglades National Park, which is located in Palm Beach and Hendry counties, is also located in Florida.  This inference is logical and reasonable, as the location of the park is not explicitly mentioned in the premise, but it can be inferred based on the context and the geographical location of the counties mentioned."	140	
1760529746	1760529749	Premise: Rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy and ultimately death. Early symptoms of rabies in humans are nonspecific, consisting of fever, headache, and general malaise.  Hypothesis: Rabies is fatal in humans.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the hypothesis ""Rabies is fatal in humans"" follows logically from the premise ""Rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy and ultimately death.""  The premise states that the Rabies virus infects the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord. Once the virus enters the central nervous system, it can cause inflammation and damage to the brain tissue, leading to encephalopathy (brain inflammation). This inflammation can eventually progress to fatal consequences, including death.  Therefore, the hypothesis that rabies is fatal in humans is a logical conclusion based on the premise. The premise provides the mechanism by which rabies can cause fatal consequences, and the hypothesis simply states that this mechanism leads to death. In other words, the premise sets the stage for the hypothesis to follow, making it a valid logical conclusion."	202	
1760529749	1760529752	Premise: American tobacco companies were showing a profit most quarters due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products sold including food.  Hypothesis: PM often entered markets with both cigarettes and food.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that American tobacco companies were showing a profit most quarters due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products sold, including food. This implies that these companies were successful in expanding their business and generating profits through various means, including exporting cigarettes and selling other products.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that PM (a fictional tobacco company) often entered markets with both cigarettes and food. This implies that PM was also successful in expanding its business and generating profits through similar means as the other American tobacco companies mentioned in the premise.  Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise, as it suggests that PM, like other American tobacco companies, was able to diversify its product offerings and enter new markets to generate profits.	195	
1760529752	1760529754	Premise: The development of agriculture by early humans, roughly 10,000 years ago, was also harmful to many natural ecosystems as they were systematically destroyed and replaced with artificial versions.  Hypothesis: Humans existed 10,000 years ago.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not directly follow from the premise.  The premise states that the development of agriculture by early humans was harmful to many natural ecosystems, but it does not necessarily imply that humans existed 10,000 years ago. The development of agriculture could have occurred at any point in human history, and it is possible that humans existed before or after the development of agriculture.  To support the hypothesis, additional evidence would be needed to establish that humans existed 10,000 years ago. For example, archaeological evidence of human settlements or artifacts from that time period would be necessary to support the hypothesis.	142	
1760529754	1760529755	Premise: The two young leaders of the coup, Pibul Songgram and Pridi Phanomyang, both educated in Europe and influenced by Western ideas, came to dominate Thai politics in the ensuing years.  Hypothesis: Pibul was a young leader.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise. The premise only states that Pibul and Pridi were both educated in Europe and influenced by Western ideas, but it does not provide any information about their ages or when they became leaders.  While it is possible that Pibul may have been a young leader, there is no explicit mention of his age in the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be inferred directly from the given information.	97	
1760529755	1760529758	"Premise: Lin Piao, after all, was the creator of Mao's ""Little Red Book"" of quotations.  Hypothesis: Lin Piao wrote the ""Little Red Book"".  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"  No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Lin Piao was the creator of Mao's ""Little Red Book"" of quotations, which means that Lin Piao was the person responsible for collecting and organizing Mao's quotes into a single book. However, this does not necessarily mean that Lin Piao was the author of the quotes themselves.  It is possible that Mao wrote the quotes himself, or that someone else collected and compiled them on his behalf. Without additional information, it is impossible to determine who actually wrote the quotes in Mao's ""Little Red Book"". Therefore, the hypothesis that Lin Piao wrote the quotes is not logically implied by the premise."	159	
1760529758	1760529762	Premise: When patients interrupt a course of antibiotics, the surviving bacteria return with a vengeance, often having rapidly mutated to resist the therapy.  Hypothesis: Bacteria is winning the war against antibiotics.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the hypothesis ""Bacteria is winning the war against antibiotics"" follows logically from the premise ""When patients interrupt a course of antibiotics, the surviving bacteria return with a vengeance, often having rapidly mutated to resist the therapy.""  The premise suggests that when antibiotics are stopped too soon, the bacteria that survive the initial treatment can adapt and become resistant to the therapy. This means that the antibiotics are not effectively killing all of the bacteria, and some may even be thriving despite the treatment.  The hypothesis logically extends this idea by suggesting that the bacteria are not only adapting to the antibiotics but are actually gaining the upper hand in the battle. In other words, the bacteria are winning the war against antibiotics, as they are able to survive and thrive even after treatment has been stopped.  Therefore, the hypothesis follows logically from the premise, as it provides a logical extension of the idea that bacteria can adapt to antibiotics and become resistant to them."	244	
1760529762	1760529764	Premise: Initially the Bundesbank opposed the introduction of the euro but was compelled to accept it in light of the political pressure of the capitalist politicians who supported its introduction.  Hypothesis: The introduction of the euro has been opposed.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the hypothesis ""The introduction of the euro has been opposed"" follows logically from the premise ""The Bundesbank initially opposed the introduction of the euro but was compelled to accept it.""  The premise states that the Bundesbank, an important German economic institution, initially opposed the introduction of the euro. This means that they had a negative view of the idea of introducing a single currency for the European Union.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, simply states that the introduction of the euro has been opposed. This is a more general statement that could be true regardless of the specific institution or individual's views on the matter. Given the premise, it is reasonable to assume that the hypothesis is true, as the Bundesbank's opposition to the euro was eventually overcome by political pressure.  Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise."	179	0.8
1760529764	1760529766	Premise: The Armed Forces Press Committee (COPREFA) admitted that the government troops sustained 11 casualties in these clashes, adding that they inflicted three casualties on the rebels.  Hypothesis: Three rebels were killed by government troops.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the government troops sustained 11 casualties in the clashes, while the hypothesis states that three rebels were killed by government troops. These are two different numbers, and there is no logical connection between them. The premise does not provide any information about the number of rebels killed, so the hypothesis is not implied or supported by the premise.  Therefore, the hypothesis is not a logical consequence of the premise, and it is not a valid conclusion that can be drawn from the information provided.	127	
1760529766	1760529769	Premise: One economic study will not be the basis of Canada's public policy decisions, but Easton's research does conclusively show that there are economic benefits in the legalization of marijuana.  Hypothesis: Drug legalization has benefits.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise.  The premise states that one economic study will not be the basis of Canada's public policy decisions, but Easton's research does conclusively show that there are economic benefits in the legalization of marijuana. This means that one study, while conclusive, is not enough to form the basis of public policy decisions.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a broader statement that drug legalization has benefits. This statement could be supported by multiple studies, not just one, and would require a comprehensive analysis of the economic, social, and health impacts of drug legalization.  Therefore, while Easton's study may provide evidence in support of the hypothesis, the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise.	170	
1760529769	1760529772	Premise: Archaeologists have found approximately 30 beautifully preserved mummies in a 4,000 year old Egyptian necropolis which held 53 tombs. Supervisor of Antiquities for Middle Egypt Dr. Abdel-Rahman El-Ayedi's team established his archaeological site in the Faiyum Oasis near the El-Lahun Egyptian pyramid which is just south of Cairo. Besides the mummies, the team found masks, amulets, clay pots and an offering table located in a funerary chapel. The chapel dates back to about 30 BC to 337 AD.  Hypothesis: 30 beautifully preserved mummies have been located in the south of Cairo.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the archaeologists found approximately 30 beautifully preserved mummies in a 4,000 year old Egyptian necropolis, which held 53 tombs. The necropolis is located near the El-Lahun Egyptian pyramid, which is south of Cairo.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that 30 beautifully preserved mummies have been located in the south of Cairo. This is not the same location as the necropolis mentioned in the premise. While it is possible that the mummies were moved or reburied in a different location, there is no evidence in the premise to suggest that this is the case. Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.	184	
1760529772	1760529774	Premise: Gastrointestinal bleeding can happen as an adverse effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin or ibuprofen.  Hypothesis: Aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that gastrointestinal bleeding can happen as an adverse effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen. This means that aspirin, like other NSAIDs, can cause gastrointestinal bleeding as a potential side effect.  However, the hypothesis states that aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding. This is a contradictory statement, as the premise indicates that aspirin can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, not prevent it. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.	157	
1760529774	1760529776	Premise: A former employee of the company, David Vance of South Portland, said Hooper spent a lot of time on the road, often meeting with customers between Portland and Kittery.  Hypothesis: Hooper is a citizen of Portland.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise.  The premise states that David Vance, a former employee of the company, said that Hooper spent a lot of time on the road, often meeting with customers between Portland and Kittery. This information does not provide any information about Hooper's residency or citizenship.  While it is possible that Hooper may live in Portland or nearby, the premise does not provide any explicit information to support this hypothesis. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Hooper is a citizen of Portland based solely on the given premise.	130	
1760529776	1760529778	Premise: Cyprus, divided or not, joins the EU on the 1st of May.  Hypothesis: Cyprus was divided into two parts on May 1.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise.  The premise states that Cyprus joins the EU on May 1st, but it does not mention anything about the island being divided. In fact, the premise implies that Cyprus is united and becomes a member of the EU as a single entity.  While it is possible that Cyprus could be divided after joining the EU, the premise does not provide any information to support this hypothesis. Therefore, it is not a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the premise.	118	
1760529778	1760529780	Premise: World leaders expressed concern on Thursday that North Korea will quit six-party nuclear disarmament talks and will  bolster its nuclear weapons arsenal.  Hypothesis: North Korea says it has a stockpile of nuclear weapons and is building more.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that world leaders are expressing concern that North Korea may quit six-party nuclear disarmament talks and bolster its nuclear weapons arsenal. This suggests that North Korea is taking actions that are concerning to other countries, which could include developing or acquiring more nuclear weapons.  The hypothesis explicitly states that North Korea has a stockpile of nuclear weapons and is building more, which further supports the idea that North Korea is taking steps to enhance its nuclear capabilities.  Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise, as it provides more specific details about North Korea's actions and intentions.	142	
1760529780	1760529782	Premise: In addition to establishing the electoral commission, the laws also concern nationality, a contentious issue since citizenship laws were tightened to exclude one of Gbagbo's main competitors from the 2000 presidential race, former prime minister Alassane Ouattara.  Hypothesis: Gbagbo is a competitor of Ouattara.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise.  The premise only mentions that the laws concern nationality, which could refer to any number of issues related to citizenship and nationality, including the exclusion of a competitor from the 2000 presidential race. It does not explicitly state that Gbagbo is a competitor of Ouattara.  While it is possible that Gbagbo and Ouattara are competitors, this is not a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the premise alone. Additional information or context is needed to establish this connection.	128	
1760529782	1760529784	Premise: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace Prize, though he was nominated for it five times between 1937 and 1948.  Hypothesis: Mohandas received the Nobel Prize in 1989.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize five times between 1937 and 1948, but did not receive it. This means that Gandhi never actually received the Nobel Prize.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Gandhi received the Nobel Prize in 1989, which is after the time period mentioned in the premise. This is a contradictory statement, as Gandhi passed away in 1948, long before the year 1989. Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.	145	
1760529784	1760529788	Premise: The Christian Democrats (CDU) won 35.2% of the vote, or 225 seats, against 34.3% for Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats (SPD).  Hypothesis: It seems unlikely that there will be a coalition between Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats and Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that the Christian Democrats (CDU) won 35.2% of the vote and 225 seats, while the Social Democrats (SPD) won 34.3% of the vote and 209 seats. This means that the CDU has a clear majority in the German parliament, with 225 seats to the SPD's 209 seats.  Given this majority, it is unlikely that the CDU would be willing to form a coalition with the SPD, as they could easily govern on their own. Additionally, the SPD may not be willing to form a coalition with the CDU due to political differences between the two parties, particularly on issues such as economic policy and social welfare.  Therefore, the hypothesis that it is unlikely that there will be a coalition between the CDU and SPD follows logically from the premise.	207	
1760529788	1760529789	Premise: Edward VIII became King in January of 1936 and abdicated in December.  Hypothesis: King Edward VIII abdicated in December 1936.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise.  The premise states that Edward VIII became King in January of 1936, but it does not mention anything about him abdicating. In fact, the premise only mentions his accession to the throne, not his abdication.  Therefore, the hypothesis that he abdicated in December 1936 is not implied by the premise. The two statements are independent of each other and cannot be deduced from one another.	110	
1760529789	1760529790	"Premise: Australian Guantanamo Bay detainee David Hicks has won British citizenship, opening the door for a possible bid to have him freed from the US detention facility in Cuba. Justice Lawrence Collins of the British High Court has overturned the British Government's refusal of citizenship to Hicks, whose mother was born in England. Justice Collins said the Government had ""no power to withhold or deprive citizenship"". Justice Collins said: ""In my view it would be improper to fail to give assistance which otherwise would have been given, simply because the claimant was believed to be involved in terrorism and has not had any previous connection with this country."" Hicks' lawyer, Stephen Grosz, said the decision was a breakthrough. He said there was now no reason why Hicks should not enjoy the same protection as the nine other British citizens released without charge from Guantanamo Bay on representations of the British Government.  Hypothesis: Stephen Grosz is the British lawyer of David Hicks.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise. According to the premise, Stephen Grosz is the lawyer of David Hicks, which means he is the one who made the statement about the decision being a breakthrough and the reason why Hicks should now enjoy the same protection as the other British citizens released without charge from Guantanamo Bay.	73	
1760529790	1760529793	Premise: Rockweed has been harvested commercially in Nova Scotia since the late 1950's and is currently the most important commercial seaweed in Atlantic Canada.  Hypothesis: Marine vegetation is  harvested.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the hypothesis ""Marine vegetation is harvested"" follows from the premise ""Rockweed has been harvested commercially in Nova Scotia since the late 1950's and is currently the most important commercial seaweed in Atlantic Canada.""  The premise provides historical and geographical context for the harvesting of rockweed, which is a type of marine vegetation. The premise establishes that rockweed has been commercially harvested in Nova Scotia for a significant period of time and is currently the most important commercial seaweed in Atlantic Canada.  Therefore, the hypothesis ""Marine vegetation is harvested"" logically follows from the premise, as it suggests that the harvesting of rockweed is an example of the broader phenomenon of marine vegetation being harvested."	183	1.0
1760529793	1760529794	Premise: Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has ordered security forces to take firm action against rioters following the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto. The violence has left at least 44 people dead and dozens injured. Mr. Musharraf insisted the measures were to protect people. VOA's Ayaz Gul reports from Islamabad that a bitter dispute has also erupted over how the 54-year-old politician died and who was behind her assassination.  Hypothesis: Musharraf has ordered rioters to take firm action against security forces.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that President Musharraf has ordered security forces to take firm action against rioters, but the hypothesis states that Musharraf has ordered rioters to take firm action against security forces. These are two different actions and are not logically consistent with each other.	74	
1760529794	1760529797	"Premise: A month after Gov. David A. Paterson dropped his proposal for a soda tax, New York City's health commissioner has written an article advocating ""hefty"" taxes on sodas and sports drinks containing sugar. Such a tax, the article said, could be the biggest boon to public health since tobacco taxes. The commissioner, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, and Kelly D. Brownell of Yale University, his co-author, argue in the New England Journal of Medicine that a tax of a penny per ounce could reduce consumption by more than 10 percent and raise $1.2 billion a year in New York State alone.  Hypothesis: Michael Bloomberg is the mayor of New York.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that the health commissioner of New York City, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, and Kelly D. Brownell of Yale University have written an article advocating for a tax on sodas and sports drinks containing sugar. The article suggests that such a tax could be a significant public health measure and could raise a significant amount of revenue for the state.  As Michael Bloomberg is the mayor of New York City, it is reasonable to assume that he would be involved in any major public health initiatives in the city, including the proposal for a soda tax. Therefore, it is likely that Bloomberg would be supportive of the tax proposal and would work with Frieden and Brownell to implement it.	165	
1760529797	1760529799	Premise: Officials said the Finnish suspect was among the dead but did not provide a motive for the attack.  Hypothesis: Officials said that the suspect, a Finnish citizen, was among the dead.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"  No, the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise.  The premise states that ""officials said the Finnish suspect was among the dead."" This implies that the suspect is among the deceased, but it does not provide any information about the suspect's motivation for the attack. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the suspect's motive for the attack is not provided by officials. This is a separate statement from the premise and does not logically follow from it.  Therefore, the hypothesis is not a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the premise."	126	
1760529799	1760529801	Premise: Britain agreed to lift by March 31 a 150-mile military protection zone enforced around the islands since Argentina invaded them in 1982.  Hypothesis: The military protection zone around Falklands was lifted.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise.  The premise states that Britain agreed to lift a 150-mile military protection zone around the Falkland Islands by March 31. This means that the zone will be lifted by that date, but it does not necessarily mean that the military protection zone itself has been lifted.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the military protection zone around the Falklands was lifted. This is a more definitive statement that implies the zone is no longer in place, which may or may not be the case depending on the circumstances.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise.	142	
1760529801	1760529804	"Premise: The ferry owner PT Nur Budi's spokesman blamed Indonesian port authorities for the tragedy. ""The passenger capacity of the ferry is 205 people but the port administrator accepted more passengers as they thought it was possible,"" he said. The National Meteorological and Geophysics Agency, however, had published and raised an alert signal about high waves on Friday. It specifically stated that ""Saturday 10th and Sunday 11th, Indonesian waters would have witnessed storm force waves,"" but despite the dire warnings KM Teratai set for the seas.  Hypothesis: An Indonesian ferry with 300 passengers sank.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that the ferry, KM Teratai, set sail despite the National Meteorological and Geophysics Agency issuing an alert signal about high waves on Friday. The agency specifically stated that storm force waves were expected in Indonesian waters on Saturday and Sunday.  Given this information, it is reasonable to infer that the ferry set sail with a larger number of passengers than its designated capacity, as the spokesman for the ferry owner blamed the port authorities for accepting more passengers than the ferry was designed to accommodate. This overloading of passengers increases the risk of the ferry capsizing in rough waters, as there are more people on board than the vessel is designed to safely carry.  Therefore, the hypothesis that an Indonesian ferry with 300 passengers sank follows logically from the premise, as the combination of overloading and adverse weather conditions increases the likelihood of a tragic event occurring.	212	
1760529804	1760529806	Premise: Tension and battles between Greek police and anarchist demonstrators took place in the centre of Athens, Greece, during the anti-war demonstration of the 4th European Social Forum which is taking place in the Greek capital, from 4 to 7 of May 2006. The march of the approximately 1,000 anarchists ended with clashes between groups of anarchists and police. Riot police used tear gas, while a branch of a Greek bank, a fast-food store and around 50 shop windows in central Athens were damaged.  Hypothesis: The riots in Greece started on December 6.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that the tension and battles between Greek police and anarchist demonstrators took place in Athens on May 4-7, 2006, during the anti-war demonstration of the 4th European Social Forum. This event occurred in 2006, but the hypothesis states that the riots in Greece started on December 6, which is a different date. Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.	112	
1760529806	1760529808	Premise: Libya's case against Britain and the US concerns the dispute over their demand for extradition of Libyans charged with blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in 1988.  Hypothesis: One case involved the extradition of Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Libya is taking legal action against Britain and the US, which suggests that there is a dispute between the two countries and Libya. The hypothesis specifically mentions the extradition of Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing, which is a specific incident that is mentioned in the premise as a point of contention between Libya and the US. Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise.	105	
1760529808	1760529811	Premise: Argentina sought help from Britain on its privatization program and encouraged British investment.  Hypothesis: Argentina sought UK expertise on privatization and agriculture.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the hypothesis follows logically from the premise.  The premise states that Argentina sought help from Britain on its privatization program and encouraged British investment. Privatization is a process of transferring ownership of state-owned assets to the private sector, which often involves restructuring and selling off state-owned companies to private investors. Britain is known for its expertise in privatization and has a long history of successful privatization programs in various countries.  Therefore, it makes sense that Argentina, which was seeking to privatize its own state-owned assets, would seek help and expertise from a country like Britain that has a proven track record in this area. Additionally, by encouraging British investment, Argentina may have been hoping to attract investors who have experience in privatization and agriculture, as Britain has a strong agricultural sector.  So, the hypothesis that Argentina sought UK expertise on privatization and agriculture follows logically from the premise.	211	
1760529811	1760529813	Premise: Instead of action on crime, we got the federal long gun registry, which became a bloated bureaucratic nightmare to responsible hunters, farmers and rural Canadians. It cost taxpayers some CA$2 billion and it hasn't done a thing to reduce gun crime. said Harper. The Conservatives have provided amnesty for unregistered gun owners. At this time there is no legislation set before the House of Commons. Conservative Garry Breitkreuz from Saskatchewan tabled the bill killing the long-gun registry.  Hypothesis: Garry Breitkreuz is a member of the Conservative Party.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that the federal long gun registry became a ""bloated bureaucratic nightmare"" to responsible hunters, farmers, and rural Canadians, and that it has not done anything to reduce gun crime. This is a criticism of the long gun registry, which is a policy initiative of the Conservative Party.  Garry Breitkreuz is a member of the Conservative Party, and he tabled a bill to kill the long-gun registry. Therefore, it follows that Garry Breitkreuz is a member of the party that created and supports the long gun registry, which has been criticized in the premise."	149	0.8888888888888888
1760529813	1760529816	Premise: The researchers in the latest study fed one group of mice a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat. The diet started when the mice, all males, were 1 year old, which is middle-age in mouse longevity. As expected, the mice soon developed signs of impending diabetes, with grossly enlarged livers, and started to die much sooner than mice fed a standard diet.  Hypothesis: At the age of one year, male mice were fed with a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that the researchers fed one group of mice a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat, starting when the mice were 1 year old (middle-age in mouse longevity). This diet led to the mice developing signs of impending diabetes and dying sooner than mice fed a standard diet.  The hypothesis is a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the premise. The premise provides the conditions of the experiment (the diet and the age of the mice) and the outcome (the mice developed signs of diabetes and died sooner). The hypothesis states the expected relationship between these conditions and the outcome, specifically that the high-fat diet at middle age led to the observed outcomes. Therefore, the hypothesis follows logically from the premise.	189	
1760529816	1760529819	Premise: The soldiers, who were said to have been wearing Arab headdress, were accused of firing at Iraqi police when stopped at a road block.  Hypothesis: The soldiers were driving a civilian car and were dressed in civilian clothes when a shooting took place between them and Iraqi patrols.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise.  The premise states that the soldiers were wearing Arab headdress, which is a traditional form of headwear in the Middle East, particularly in Iraq and other Arab countries. This does not necessarily imply that they were driving a civilian car or dressed in civilian clothes.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the soldiers were driving a civilian car and were dressed in civilian clothes when a shooting took place between them and Iraqi patrols. This is a separate claim that is not directly supported by the premise.  While it is possible that the soldiers were dressed in civilian clothes and driving a civilian car, the premise does not provide any information to support this hypothesis. Therefore, it is not a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the premise.	179	
1760529819	1760529822	"Premise: The United States would like to see U.N. weapons inspectors return to Iraq providing the Iraqis take concrete, affirmative and demonstrable actions ""to show full co-operation"" Clinton said.  Hypothesis: U.N. weapons inspectors could stay in Iraq, Clinton said.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that the United States would like to see U.N. weapons inspectors return to Iraq, provided the Iraqis take concrete, affirmative, and demonstrable actions to show full cooperation.  The hypothesis states that U.N. weapons inspectors could stay in Iraq. This follows from the premise because if the Iraqis are taking concrete, affirmative, and demonstrable actions to show full cooperation, then it is possible for the U.N. weapons inspectors to remain in Iraq to verify the Iraqi government's compliance with U.N. resolutions and to conduct inspections as needed.  In other words, the hypothesis is a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the premise, as it provides a possible outcome if the Iraqis are cooperative.	189	
1760529822	1760529824	Premise: On 12 August, the San Carlos Battalion came across mines placed in their path and one soldier was killed while two were seriously injured. Meanwhile on 10 August, urban commandos took a patrol car by surprise and dropped a grenade inside the car, injuring four and partially destroying the vehicle.  Hypothesis: A patrol car was attacked by the San Carlos Battalion.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the San Carlos Battalion came across mines placed in their path and one soldier was killed while two were seriously injured. It also mentions that urban commandos took a patrol car by surprise and dropped a grenade inside the car, injuring four and partially destroying the vehicle.  However, the hypothesis states that a patrol car was attacked by the San Carlos Battalion. This is not supported by the premise, as the premise does not mention anything about the San Carlos Battalion attacking a patrol car. In fact, the premise specifically mentions that the urban commandos took a patrol car by surprise and attacked it.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.	161	
1760529824	1760529827	Premise: Bomb-sniffing dogs were brought to Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment.  Hypothesis: Bomb-sniffing dogs were estimated at Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise.  The premise states that bomb-sniffing dogs were brought to Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment. This implies that the dogs were present at the apartment, but it does not necessarily mean that they were used to sniff for bombs. The hypothesis, on the other hand, implies that the dogs were used to sniff for bombs, which is a more specific and conclusive statement than just being present at the apartment.  Therefore, while the premise provides some information about the location of the dogs, it does not provide enough evidence to support the hypothesis. Additional evidence or context would be needed to confirm whether the dogs were actually used for bomb detection.	158	
1760529827	1760529830	Premise: Startling new research into mobile phones claims they may reduce a man's sperm count by up to 30%.  Hypothesis: Male fertility may be affected by use of a mobile phones.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that new research has found that mobile phones may reduce a man's sperm count by up to 30%. This suggests that there is a correlation between mobile phone use and reduced fertility in men.  To infer the hypothesis, we can logically deduce that the use of mobile phones may have a negative impact on male fertility. This is because the radiofrequency radiation emitted by mobile phones has been shown to have adverse effects on the male reproductive system in some studies.  While the exact mechanism by which mobile phones affect fertility is not fully understood, it is possible that the radiation emitted by these devices could interfere with the normal functioning of the reproductive system, leading to a decrease in sperm count and fertility.  Therefore, the hypothesis that male fertility may be affected by the use of mobile phones is a logical conclusion based on the premise.	208	
1760529830	1760529833	Premise: Workers at the Lufthansa Technik Automotive plant in Co Dublin are due to vote today on changes to work practices being sought by the company's management. The aircraft engine maintenace firm has warned that rejection of the proposals would threaten a planned €17230m investment in the Rathcoole plant and put jobs at risk. LTA says it is not seeking any lay-offs or pay cuts and the planned investment would guarantee the future of the plant for the next 15 years. The work-practice changes are being sought following the collapse of Labour Relations Commission talks on the matter.  Hypothesis: Lufthansa Technik Automotive fires 30 workers.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise.  The premise states that the workers at the Lufthansa Technik Automotive plant in Co Dublin are due to vote today on changes to work practices being sought by the company's management. If the workers reject the proposals, the company has warned that it may threaten a planned €17230m investment in the Rathcoole plant and put jobs at risk. However, the company is not seeking any lay-offs or pay cuts.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Lufthansa Technik Automotive fires 30 workers. This is not mentioned in the premise, and there is no indication in the premise that the company would take such action. Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise.	183	
1760529833	1760529836	Premise: It rewrites the rules of global trade, established by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, in 1947, and modified in multiple rounds of negotiations since then.  Hypothesis: GATT was formed in 1947.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"  No, the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise.  The premise states that the World Trade Organization (WTO) ""rewrites the rules of global trade, established by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, in 1947, and modified in multiple rounds of negotiations since then.""  GATT was indeed established in 1947, but the WTO was not formed until 1995. Therefore, the hypothesis that GATT was formed in 1947 is not supported by the premise.  However, it is possible to infer that GATT was a precursor to the WTO, and that the rules of global trade established by GATT were rewritten and updated by the WTO. Therefore, the premise provides some background information that could support the hypothesis, but the two statements do not logically follow from each other."	200	
1760529836	1760529838	Premise: Vice President Dick Cheney on Tuesday hurled an obscenity on the Senate floor to punctuate an angry exchange with Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy as all senators gathered for their annual photo.  Hypothesis: Cheney cursed at Sen. Patrick Leahy.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Vice President Dick Cheney hurled an obscenity on the Senate floor, which implies that he used offensive language during a heated exchange with someone in the Senate. Since Patrick Leahy is a senator and was present on the Senate floor at the time, it is likely that the obscenity was directed at him. Therefore, the hypothesis that Cheney cursed at Leahy is a logical conclusion based on the premise.	109	
1760529838	1760529839	Premise: In the May 2005 general election Michael Howard failed to unseat the Labour Government, although the Conservatives did gain 33 seats, playing the most significant role in reducing Labour's majority from 167 to 66.  Hypothesis: In the May 2005 general election Conservatives got 33 seats.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Michael Howard failed to unseat the Labour Government in the May 2005 general election. This means that the Labour Party won the election and retained power, which contradicts the hypothesis that the Conservatives gained 33 seats.  The premise and the hypothesis are therefore mutually exclusive, and the hypothesis cannot be logically deduced from the premise.	96	
1760529839	1760529843	Premise: The Norwegian Newspaper Corpus is a large and self-expanding corpus of Norwegian newspaper texts. The collection of this dynamic and continually growing corpus began in 1998.  Hypothesis: Dagbladet is a Norwegian newspaper.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the hypothesis ""Dagbladet is a Norwegian newspaper"" follows from the premise ""The Norwegian Newspaper Corpus is a large and self-expanding corpus of Norwegian newspaper texts.""  The premise states that the corpus is a collection of Norwegian newspaper texts, and Dagbladet is a Norwegian newspaper. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Dagbladet is included in the corpus.  This inference is based on the fact that the corpus is a collection of Norwegian newspapers, and Dagbladet is a well-known Norwegian newspaper that has been in publication since 1875. It is likely that Dagbladet's texts have been included in the corpus at some point in time, given its longevity and prominence in the Norwegian media landscape.  Therefore, the hypothesis ""Dagbladet is a Norwegian newspaper"" follows logically from the premise ""The Norwegian Newspaper Corpus is a large and self-expanding corpus of Norwegian newspaper texts."""	224	
1760529843	1760529845	Premise: The Dutch, who ruled Indonesia until 1949, called the city of Jakarta Batavia.  Hypothesis: Formerly ( until 1949 ) Batavia, Jakarta is largest city and capital of Indonesia.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that the Dutch, who ruled Indonesia until 1949, called the city of Jakarta Batavia. This means that during the time when the Dutch ruled Indonesia, the name of the city was Batavia.  The hypothesis states that Jakarta is the largest city and capital of Indonesia. This is true, as Jakarta is currently the largest city and capital of Indonesia.  Therefore, based on the premise and hypothesis, it can be inferred that Jakarta was formerly known as Batavia, which further supports the hypothesis.	130	
1760529845	1760529847	"Premise: The name for the newest James Bond film has been announced today. The 22nd film, previously known only as ""Bond 22"", will be called ""Quantum of Solace"". EON Productions who are producing the film made the announcement today at Pinewood Studios, where production for the film has been under way since last year. The name of the film was inspired by a short story (of the same name) from For Your Eyes Only by Bond creator, Ian Fleming.  Hypothesis: James Bond was created by Ian Fleming.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"  Yes, the hypothesis ""James Bond was created by Ian Fleming"" follows logically from the premise.  The premise states that the name of the newest Bond film, ""Quantum of Solace,"" was inspired by a short story of the same name from For Your Eyes Only, a collection of Bond stories written by Ian Fleming. This implies that Ian Fleming is the creator of the James Bond character, as he is the only author credited with writing the Bond stories.  Therefore, the hypothesis that James Bond was created by Ian Fleming is a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the premise."	135	
1760529847	1760529849	Premise: The gastric bypass operation, also known as stomach stapling, has become the most common surgical procedure for treating obesity.  Hypothesis: Obesity is medically treated.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise.  The premise states that the gastric bypass operation, or stomach stapling, is the most common surgical procedure for treating obesity. This implies that obesity is treated through surgical means, specifically through gastric bypass surgery. However, the hypothesis goes beyond this by stating that obesity is medically treated, which implies that there are other medical treatments for obesity beyond surgery.  While gastric bypass surgery is a common treatment for obesity, there are also other medical treatments, such as medications, lifestyle changes, and behavioral therapy, that can be used to treat obesity. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.	175	
1760529849	1760529852	Premise: The cost of the consumer of the United States fell in June.  Hypothesis: U.S. consumer spending dived in June.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the premise.  The premise states that the cost of the consumer of the United States fell in June, which could be due to a variety of factors that do not necessarily indicate a decrease in consumer spending. For example, the cost of consumers could have fallen due to a decrease in the cost of goods or services, or due to a decrease in the number of consumers.  On the other hand, the hypothesis implies that U.S. consumer spending dived in June, which implies a more significant and specific change in consumer behavior. While a decrease in consumer spending could be a possible explanation for the cost of consumers falling, it is not the only possible explanation, and there could be other factors at play.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.	176	1.0
1760529852	1760529855	"Premise: The former leader of Iraq was rushed to hospital last Sunday after refusing to eat for sixteen days. But according to news agencies, he has ended the hunger strike by eating lunch at the court in Baghdad. ""Saddam ate beef and rice and cola with bread which he brought from hospital,"" one source told Reuters news agency. He was fasting with three co-defendants, and they were demanding more security for their defence lawyers, three of whom have been murdered.  Hypothesis: Some Australians have fasted to protest.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that the former leader of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, ended a 16-day hunger strike by eating lunch at a court in Baghdad. This event is mentioned in the context of Saddam and his co-defendants demanding more security for their defense lawyers, three of whom have been murdered.  The hypothesis, ""Some Australians have fasted to protest,"" is a generalization of the premise, as it suggests that the idea of fasting as a form of protest is not unique to Iraq, but can also occur in other countries, including Australia. The premise provides no information about the nationality of the individuals involved in the hunger strike, so it is reasonable to assume that the hypothesis could apply to Australians or any other group of people."	187	
1760529855	1760529857	Premise: Sonia Gandhi can be defeated in the next elections in India by BJP.  Hypothesis: Sonia Gandhi is defeated by BJP.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.  The premise states that Sonia Gandhi can be defeated in the next elections in India by BJP, which implies that there is a possibility of her defeat. However, it does not necessarily mean that she will be defeated. There are many factors that can influence the outcome of an election, such as the performance of the incumbent government, the opposition party's campaign strategy, and the voters' preferences.  Therefore, it is not logical to conclude that Sonia Gandhi will definitely be defeated by BJP based solely on the premise provided. The outcome of the election will depend on various factors and can go either way.	151	
1760529857	1760529860	Premise: Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has said that Mahmoud Abbas is a man that Israel can do business with.  Hypothesis: Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, may be someone Israel can talk with.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has said that Mahmoud Abbas is a man that Israel can do business with. This implies that Sharon has a positive view of Abbas and believes that he is a reliable partner with whom Israel can negotiate and reach agreements.  The hypothesis suggests that based on Sharon's assessment, Abbas may be someone Israel can talk with and work with. This is a logical conclusion to draw from the premise, as if Sharon thinks Abbas is a trustworthy partner, it is likely that Israel will also view him as such.  Therefore, the hypothesis follows from the premise.	152	
1760529860	1760529861	Premise: The Tempe Hometown Premiere will have all the trappings of a mega-Hollywood  event including red carpet arrivals, klieg lights, screaming fans, paparazzi and  media coverage of the film`s stars headed by Wolverine himself, Hugh Jackman and  including Liev Schreiber, Ryan Reynolds, Taylor Kitsch, Lynn Collins, will.i.am  and director Gavin Hood.  Following a hard-fought contest stretching over thousands of cities and towns  across the United States, Tempe emerged triumphant in a far-reaching, citywide  bid to nab the gala event. Mayor Hugh Hallman himself rallied the community,  which stepped up with dozens of videos that were posted on YouTube.  Hypothesis: Hugh Jackman plays the role of Wolverine in the movie.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise. The premise mentions the arrival of Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber, but it does not explicitly state that Hugh Jackman plays the role of Wolverine. In fact, the premise does not mention the name of the character he plays. Therefore, the hypothesis is not supported by the premise.	79	
1760529861	1760529863	Premise: In October, however, amid rising tensions between the government and opposition groups, a car bomb seriously injured an opposition politician and killed his driver, in Beirut.  Hypothesis: A member of the opposition was injured in a car bomb attack in Beirut.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that a car bomb seriously injured an opposition politician and killed his driver in Beirut in October, which implies that the attack was carried out by someone who intended to target the opposition politician. The hypothesis then logically follows that a member of the opposition was injured in the attack.  The reasoning is as follows:  1. The premise states that the attack injured an opposition politician and killed his driver. 2. The opposition politician is a member of the opposition group. 3. Therefore, a member of the opposition was injured in the attack.  This chain of reasoning logically follows from the premise, making the hypothesis a valid conclusion.	149	
1760529863	1760529867	Premise: Weinstock painstakingly reviewed dozens of studies for evidence of any link between sunscreen use and either an increase or decrease in melanoma.  Hypothesis: skin cancer numbers increase.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise.  The premise states that Weinstock reviewed dozens of studies for evidence of any link between sunscreen use and melanoma. This implies that Weinstock was looking for evidence of a possible association between sunscreen use and melanoma, rather than a cause-and-effect relationship. In other words, Weinstock was trying to determine whether sunscreen use might increase or decrease the risk of melanoma, rather than simply stating that it does.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, implies a direct cause-and-effect relationship between sunscreen use and melanoma, stating that skin cancer numbers will increase. This is a stronger claim than what the premise suggests, as it implies that sunscreen use is the direct cause of an increase in melanoma cases.  Therefore, while the premise provides some evidence to support the hypothesis, it does not logically follow from the premise that sunscreen use will increase melanoma rates. Further evidence or reasoning would be needed to support this claim.	227	
1760529867	1760529869	Premise: Most people are familiar with the idea of St. Bernards or other dogs taking part in rescue and recovery efforts. Robots might also take part in search and rescue missions.  Hypothesis: Robots are used to find missing victims.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the hypothesis ""Robots are used to find missing victims"" follows logically from the premise ""Most people are familiar with the idea of St. Bernards or other dogs taking part in rescue and recovery efforts.""  The premise establishes that dogs are commonly used in search and rescue missions to locate missing individuals. By extension, if dogs are effective in this role, it is reasonable to assume that robots, which are capable of performing tasks that dogs cannot, such as navigating through rubble or using sensors to detect signs of life, could also be used in search and rescue missions to locate missing victims.  Therefore, the hypothesis ""Robots are used to find missing victims"" is a logical conclusion based on the premise."	160	
1760529869	1760529871	Premise: Illinois born Charlton Heston was a 27-year-old actor from Broadway and television when he arrived in Hollywood for a five-picture contract with Hal Wallis.  Hypothesis: Charlton Heston was born in Illinois.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. The premise states that Charlton Heston was born in Illinois, but the hypothesis states that he was a 27-year-old actor from Broadway and television when he arrived in Hollywood. This information does not necessarily imply that he was born in Illinois.  While it is possible that Heston was born in Illinois and later moved to Hollywood for his acting career, the premise does not provide enough information to confirm this. Therefore, the hypothesis is not logically implied by the premise.	117	
1760529871	1760529874	Premise: Ruth's 1927 single season record of 60 home runs stood unsurpassed until Roger Maris hit 61 in 1961.  Hypothesis: Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs in his lifetime.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise.  The premise states that Ruth's 1927 single season record of 60 home runs stood unsurpassed until Maris hit 61 in 1961. This means that there were other players who hit more than 60 home runs in a single season after Ruth did so in 1927, including Maris in 1961.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Ruth hit 60 home runs in his lifetime. This is not necessarily true, as Ruth's lifetime total home runs are 714, which is more than the 60 home runs he hit in 1927. Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise.	172	
1760529874	1760529876	Premise: The German technology was employed to build Shanghai's existing maglev line, the first in the world to be used commercially.  Hypothesis: Maglev is commercially used.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise.  The premise states that the German technology was employed to build Shanghai's existing maglev line, which is the first in the world to be used commercially. This means that the technology was used to build the line, but it does not necessarily mean that maglev is commercially used.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that maglev is commercially used, which is a broader claim than just the fact that the technology was used to build a specific line. To determine if the hypothesis follows from the premise, we would need additional information or evidence to support the claim that maglev is commercially used.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise.	159	
1760529876	1760529877	"Premise: SEATTLE — United Nations gang leader Clay Roueche should spend at least 30 years behind bars after his surprise guilty plea here Tuesday for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine, marijuana and illicit drug profits, U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Sullivan said. Sullivan said outside court that Roueche's leadership of the violent UN gang and the sophistication of the international drug conspiracy will all be factors used to argue for a longer sentence — up to life — for the 33-year-old Canadian. And he stressed that the plea agreement reached with Roueche did not include ""any kind of break with respect to sentencing."".  Hypothesis: Clay Roueche is 33 years old.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise. The premise states that Clay Roueche is a 33-year-old Canadian, and the hypothesis states that Clay Roueche is 33 years old. Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise.	60	
1760529877	1760529880	"Premise: Baker's voice will replace the earlier computer-synthesized voice that was previously used. BT said that his voice was chosen as it was instantly recognisable. It took him 11 days to record 11,593 phrases and sounds which could then be broken down and reassembled by a computer to make new words. It then took five months to process these recordings to make a workable service. BT have said that there will be no barriers as to what Tom Baker's voice can 'say', including rude words. ""What appeals to me most is the thought that I will be bringing good news to people whether it is a cheeky message, a birthday greeting, or just a quick hello,"" said Baker.  Hypothesis: Tom Baker works for BT.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Tom Baker's voice will replace a previous computer-synthesized voice, and that BT has said that his voice was chosen because it is instantly recognizable. This implies that Tom Baker is involved with BT in some capacity, as they have chosen to use his voice for their service.  Additionally, the premise mentions that Baker recorded 11,593 phrases and sounds, which were then processed by a computer to make a workable service. This suggests that Baker is involved in the creation and development of the service, and that he is working with BT to bring it to life.  Therefore, based on the information provided in the premise, it is reasonable to conclude that Tom Baker works for BT.	169	
1760529880	1760529882	Premise: The Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for the selection of the candidates and the choice of Prize Winners for the Peace Prize. The Committee is composed of five members appointed by the Storting (Norwegian parliament). The Peace Prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway and not in Stockholm, Sweden like the other Nobel Prizes.  Hypothesis: Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"  Yes, the hypothesis ""Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen"" follows logically from the premise ""The Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for the selection of the candidates and the choice of Prize Winners for the Peace Prize.""  The premise states that the Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for selecting the candidates and choosing the winners of the Peace Prize, and it is composed of five members appointed by the Storting (Norwegian parliament). This implies that the Committee has the authority and responsibility to select candidates for the Peace Prize, and that the candidates have been chosen.  Therefore, the conclusion that the candidates have been chosen logically follows from the premise."	140	
1760529882	1760529886	Premise: More than 150 dolphins, marine turtles and beaked whales have been washed up dead on beaches in Africa.  Hypothesis: Dead dolphins, turtles and whales have been found on African beaches.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	  No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that more than 150 dolphins, marine turtles, and beaked whales have been washed up dead on African beaches. This is a specific observation about the number and types of marine animals found on these beaches.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, is a broader statement that implies a cause-and-effect relationship between the observation and a larger phenomenon. In this case, the hypothesis suggests that the dead animals were washed up on the beaches due to some unknown factor.  While it is possible that the observed number of dead marine animals could be due to a single cause, such as a mass stranding event or a pollution incident, it is also possible that there are other factors at play. For example, changes in ocean currents or temperatures, or the presence of pollutants in the ocean, could also contribute to the observed mortality of these animals.  Therefore, while the premise provides some evidence for the hypothesis, it does not logically follow from the premise that the observed mortality is due to a specific cause. Further investigation and data collection would be needed to support or refute the hypothesis.	261
