Explain your choice."	"  No, in this sentence ""He"" does not refer to ""Mark."" The pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to ""Pete.""  The sentence states that ""Pete"" included the lies about himself in his book, which suggests that ""Pete"" is the subject of the sentence. Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" refers to ""Pete."""	78	
1760601107	1760601110	"The mothers of Arthur and Celeste have come to the town to fetch them. They are very happy to have them back, but they scold them just the same because they ran away.  In the sentence above, does ""them"" refer to ""mothers""? Explain your choice."	"  No, in this sentence ""them"" does not refer to ""mothers"".  The subject of the sentence is ""Arthur and Celeste"", and ""them"" is used as a pronoun to refer to them in the objective case. The mothers are the ones who are doing the fetching, so it is correct to use ""them"" to refer to the mothers.  The sentence should read:  ""The mothers of Arthur and Celeste have come to the town to fetch them.""  In this sentence, ""them"" is used to refer to the mothers, who are the ones performing the action of fetching Arthur and Celeste."	142

He heard him calling for the captain, promising him, in the jargon everyone talked that night, that not one thing should be damaged on the ship except only the ammunition, but the captain and all his crew had best stay in the cabin until the work was over  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Mr. Singer""? Explain your choice."	"  No, in this sentence, ""he"" does not refer to ""Mr. Singer."" The pronoun ""he"" is referring to Mark.  The sentence states that Mark is close to Mr. Singer's heels, which means that Mark is nearby Mr. Singer's feet. This implies that Mark is a different person from Mr. Singer.  Additionally, the context of the sentence suggests that Mark is the one who is hearing Mr. Singer calling for the captain and making promises in the jargon everyone talked that night. This further supports the conclusion that ""he"" refers to Mark."	129	
1760601112	1760601114	"The pony behaved well, sir, and showed no vice; but at last he just threw up his heels and tipped the young gentleman into the thorn hedge. He wanted me to help him out, but I hope you will excuse me, sir, I did not feel inclined to do so.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""young gentleman""? Explain your choice."	"  No, in this sentence ""He"" does not refer to ""young gentleman.""  The pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to the pony in the sentence. The sentence describes the pony's behavior, saying that it behaved well and showed no vice, but then suddenly threw up its heels and tipped the young gentleman into the thorn hedge. The use of ""he"" in this context indicates that the pony is the subject of the sentence and ""he"" refers to the pony.  The use of ""he"" to refer to the young gentleman is not possible in this sentence because the sentence does not provide any context that would suggest that the young gentleman is the subject of the sentence. The focus of the sentence is on the pony's behavior and the pony is the only subject of the sentence."	176	
1760601114	1760601117	"I poured water from the bottle into the cup until it was full.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""the cup""? Explain your choice."	"  Yes, in the sentence ""I poured water from the bottle into the cup until it was full,"" ""it"" refers to ""the cup.""  The pronoun ""it"" is used to refer to a previously mentioned noun or pronoun, which in this case is ""the cup."" The sentence ""poured water from the bottle into the cup"" establishes a clear connection between ""water"" and ""cup,"" so when we say ""until it was full,"" it's clear that ""it"" refers to ""cup.""  Additionally, using ""it"" to refer to ""cup"" is the most common and idiomatic way to express this idea in English. Using a different pronoun, such as ""they,"" would sound less natural in this context."	161	
1760601117	1760601119	"Dan had to stop Bill from toying with the injured bird. He is very compassionate.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Dan""? Explain your choice."	"  Yes, in the sentence ""Dan had to stop Bill from toying with the injured bird,"" ""He"" refers to ""Dan.""  The pronoun ""he"" is used to replace the noun ""Dan"" in the subject of the sentence, indicating that Dan is the one who is taking action to stop Bill. The sentence would not make sense if ""he"" referred to ""Bill,"" as Bill is the one who is engaging in the undesirable behavior (toying with the injured bird) and not the one trying to stop him.  Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in this sentence correctly refers to ""Dan."""	133	
1760601119	1760601121	"Sam Goodman 's biography of the Spartan general Xenophanes conveys a vivid sense of the difficulties he faced in his childhood.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Goodman""? Explain your choice."	"  No, in this sentence, ""he"" does not refer to ""Goodman."" The pronoun ""he"" refers to ""Xenophanes,"" the Spartan general being described in the biography written by Goodman.  The sentence structure and context make it clear that ""he"" is referring to Xenophanes, not Goodman. The sentence starts with ""Sam Goodman's biography of the Spartan general Xenophanes,"" which implies that Goodman is the author of the biography, not the subject of it. Therefore, ""he"" refers to Xenophanes, the historical figure being described in the biography."	136	
1760601121	1760601123	"Pam's parents came home and found her having sex with her boyfriend, Paul. They were furious about it.  In the sentence above, does ""They"" refer to ""Pam's parents""? Explain your choice."	"  In this sentence, ""They"" refers to ""Pam's parents.""  The pronoun ""They"" is used to refer to a group or a plural noun, and in this sentence, ""They"" is used to refer to the group of people who are angry or upset about Pam having sex with her boyfriend, which includes Pam's parents.  The sentence does not provide any other context that would suggest a different referent for ""They."" The use of ""They"" in this sentence is therefore appropriate and logical."	113	
1760601123	1760601125	"Bob paid for Charlie 's college education, but now Charlie acts as though it never happened. He is very hurt.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Bob""? Explain your choice."	"  In the sentence ""He is very hurt,"" the pronoun ""he"" most likely refers to ""Charlie.""  The sentence is written in the third person point of view, which means that the subject of the sentence (Charlie) is referred to using the third person pronouns ""he,"" ""him,"" and ""his."" The use of the third person pronouns indicates that the speaker is referring to Charlie, not Bob.  Furthermore, the context of the sentence suggests that Charlie is the one who is feeling hurt, not Bob. Bob paid for Charlie's college education, which means that Bob is the one who provided financial support for Charlie's education. Therefore, it is more logical to assume that the pronoun ""he"" refers to Charlie."	158	
1760601125	1760601127	"Billy cried because Toby wouldn't share his toy.  In the sentence above, does ""his"" refer to ""Toby""? Explain your choice."	"  No, in the sentence ""Billy cried because Toby wouldn't share his toy,"" the pronoun ""his"" does not refer to Toby. Instead, it refers to Billy.  The sentence is saying that Billy is the one who owns the toy, and he is crying because Toby is not sharing it with him. The use of the pronoun ""his"" in this context indicates that the toy belongs to Billy, and Toby is refusing to share it with him.  So, the correct answer is (A) Billy."	119	
1760601127	1760601129	"Emma did not pass the ball to Janie although she was open.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Janie""? Explain your choice."	"  No, in the sentence ""Emma did not pass the ball to Janie although she was open,"" the pronoun ""she"" does not refer to ""Janie.""  The pronoun ""she"" is ambiguous in this sentence because it could refer to either ""Emma"" or ""Janie."" To disambiguate, we need to consider the context and the meaning of the sentence.  Since ""Emma"" is the subject of the sentence and ""Janie"" is the object of the sentence, it is more likely that ""she"" refers to ""Emma."" Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Emma."	132	1.0
1760601129	1760601131	"Sam's drawing was hung just above Tina's and it did look much better with another one below it.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""Sam's drawing""? Explain your choice."	"  No, in this sentence ""it"" does not refer to ""Sam's drawing."" The pronoun ""it"" is used to refer to the phrase ""with another one below it,"" which is the object of the preposition ""above.""  The sentence should read:  Sam's drawing was hung just above Tina's, and it looked much better with another one below it.  In this sentence, ""it"" refers to the phrase ""with another one below it,"" which is the object of the preposition ""above."" The pronoun ""it"" is used to refer to the phrase as a whole, rather than the drawing itself."	135	
1760601131	1760601134	"Bob paid for Charlie 's college education, but now Charlie acts as though it never happened. He is very ungrateful.  In the sentence above, does ""He"" refer to ""Bob""? Explain your choice."	"  In the sentence ""Bob paid for Charlie's college education, but now Charlie acts as though it never happened. He is very ungrateful,"" the pronoun ""he"" refers to ""Charlie.""  The sentence is structured in a way that makes it clear that ""Charlie"" is the subject of the sentence, and the action of being ungrateful is being performed by him. The use of the word ""he"" instead of ""Bob"" helps to emphasize this point and avoid confusion.  If the sentence had been structured differently, for example: ""Bob paid for Charlie's college education, but now Charlie acts as though it never happened. He is very ungrateful,"" the pronoun ""he"" would likely refer to ""Bob."" However, in the given sentence, the pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to ""Charlie,"" indicating that he is the one acting in an ungrateful manner."	195	
1760601134	1760601137	"The lawyer asked the witness a question, but he was reluctant to answer it.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""the lawyer""? Explain your choice."	"  In the sentence ""The lawyer asked the witness a question, but he was reluctant to answer it,"" ""he"" refers to ""the witness.""  The sentence is written in the third person, using the pronoun ""he"" to refer to the witness. The sentence states that the lawyer asked the witness a question, which implies that the speaker is outside of the situation and observing it. Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" refers to the witness, not the lawyer.  Additionally, the sentence explicitly states that the witness was reluctant to answer the question, which further supports the interpretation that ""he"" refers to the witness. If ""he"" referred to the lawyer, it would imply that the lawyer was also reluctant to answer the question, which doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence."	171	
1760601137	1760601139	"Sam took French classes from Adam , because he was eager to speak it fluently.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Sam""? Explain your choice."	"  No, in the sentence ""Sam took French classes from Adam, because he was eager to speak it fluently,"" ""he"" does not refer to ""Sam.""  The pronoun ""he"" in this sentence refers to the subject of the sentence, which is ""Adam."" This is because the sentence starts with ""Adam"" and then describes an action that he performed (taking French classes). The pronoun ""he"" is used to refer back to the subject of the sentence.  So, the sentence can be read as ""Adam took French classes from Sam, because Sam was eager to speak it fluently."""	130	
1760601139	1760601141	"Sid explained his theory to Mark but he couldn't convince him.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Mark""? Explain your choice."	"  No, in the sentence ""Sid explained his theory to Mark but he couldn't convince him,"" ""he"" does not refer to ""Mark.""  The pronoun ""he"" is ambiguous in this sentence because it could refer to either ""Sid"" or ""Mark."" The context of the sentence does not provide enough information to disambiguate the pronoun.  To disambiguate the pronoun, we need to consider the context in which the sentence is used. Since ""Sid"" is the subject of the sentence, it is more likely that ""he"" refers to ""Sid."" Therefore, the correct interpretation is:  Sid explained his theory to Mark, but he couldn't convince him.  In this interpretation, ""he"" refers to ""Sid."""	165	
1760601141	1760601142	"The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence.  In the sentence above, does ""they"" refer to ""The demonstrators""?

The sentence should read: ""The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence.""  In this sentence, ""they"" is used to refer to the city councilmen, who are the ones who refused the permit to the demonstrators."	90	
1760601142	1760601145	"When Tommy dropped his ice cream, Timmy giggled, so father gave him a sympathetic look.  In the sentence above, does ""him"" refer to ""Timmy""? Explain your choice."	"  Yes, in the sentence ""Timmy giggled, so father gave him a sympathetic look,"" ""him"" refers to ""Timmy.""  The pronoun ""him"" is used to replace the noun ""Timmy"" in the sentence, indicating that the action of giggling was performed by Timmy. The word ""him"" is a masculine pronoun, which is appropriate because Timmy is a male character in the sentence.  For example, if the sentence were ""She gave her a sympathetic look,"" the pronoun ""her"" would refer to a female character, and if the sentence were ""They gave them a sympathetic look,"" the pronoun ""them"" would refer to a group of people, including both Timmy and Tommy."	160	
1760601145	1760601148	"After I saw Bill catching flies and pulling off their wings, I boxed his ears. I showed the master the flies, some crushed and some crawling about helpless, and I showed him the wings on the window sill. I never saw him so angry before; but as Bill was still howling and whining, like the coward that he was, he did not give him any more punishment of that kind, but set him up on a stool for the rest of the afternoon, and said that he should not go out to play for that week.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""the master""? Explain your choice."	"  Yes, in the given sentence, ""he"" refers to ""the master.""  The context of the sentence makes it clear that ""he"" is referring to the same person as the one mentioned earlier in the passage. The sentence states, ""I showed the master the flies, some crushed and some crawling about helpless, and I showed him the wings on the window sill."" This suggests that the speaker is addressing the master directly and is referring to him as ""he.""  Furthermore, the use of ""him"" in the sentence ""he did not give him any more punishment of that kind"" also reinforces the idea that ""he"" is referring to the master.  Therefore, based on the context and the use of pronouns in the sentence, it can be inferred that ""he"" refers to ""the master."""	178	
1760601148	1760601149	"The journalists interviewed the stars of the new movie. They were very cooperative, so the interview lasted for a long time.  In the sentence above, does ""They"" refer to ""The journalists""? Explain your choice."	"  No, in this sentence, ""They"" does not refer to ""the journalists."" The pronoun ""they"" is used to refer to the people being interviewed in the movie, not the journalists conducting the interview.  The sentence should read: ""The journalists interviewed the stars of the new movie. They were very cooperative, so the interview lasted for a long time.""  In this sentence, ""they"" refers to the stars of the movie who were being interviewed."	106	
1760601149	1760601152	"Joan made sure to thank Susan for all the help she had given.  In the sentence above, does ""she"" refer to ""Susan""? Explain your choice."	"  Yes, in the sentence ""Joan made sure to thank Susan for all the help she had given,"" the pronoun ""she"" refers to ""Susan.""  The sentence is using the pronoun ""she"" to replace the noun ""Susan"" for clarity and concision. This is a common way to refer to a person or thing in a sentence, especially when the same pronoun is used multiple times.  For example, if Joan wanted to thank Susan for multiple acts of help, she could have written: ""Joan made sure to thank Susan for all the help she had given."" By using the pronoun ""she,"" Joan is able to refer to Susan without having to repeat her name multiple times in the sentence."	155	
1760601152	1760601154	"In the storm, the tree fell down and crashed through the roof of my house. Now, I have to get it repaired.  In the sentence above, does ""it"" refer to ""The roof""? Explain your choice."	"  In the sentence ""The tree fell down and crashed through the roof of my house,"" the pronoun ""it"" refers to the tree.  The reason for this is that the sentence is in the passive voice, which means that the subject of the sentence (the tree) is not performing the action of the verb, but is rather having the action done to it. In this case, the action of falling and crashing through the roof is being done to the tree, so ""it"" is the appropriate pronoun to use.  If the sentence were in the active voice, with the subject performing the action, the pronoun would refer to the subject, not the object. For example: ""The storm caused the tree to fall down and crash through the roof of my house."" In this case, ""it"" would refer to the storm."	175

"  Yes, in the sentence ""Beth didn't get angry with Sally, who had cut her off, because she stopped and counted to ten,"" ""she"" refers to ""Beth.""  The sentence is structured in a way that makes it clear that ""she"" refers to the same person as the subject of the sentence, ""Beth."" The use of the pronoun ""she"" after the verb ""stopped"" reinforces this interpretation, as it would be illogical to assume that ""she"" refers to someone else (Sally) when ""Beth"" is the subject of the sentence.  Additionally, the context of the sentence makes it clear that ""Beth"" is the one who stopped and counted to ten, rather than ""Sally."" The sentence states that ""Sally had cut her off,"" which implies that Sally did something that affected Beth, and Beth is the one who responded by stopping and counting to ten."	200

"  No, in this sentence, ""he"" does not refer to ""the lawyer."" The pronoun ""he"" is ambiguous and could refer to either ""the witness"" or ""the lawyer.""  The sentence does not provide enough context to disambiguate the reference of ""he."" Without additional information, it is unclear which person the pronoun is intended to refer to.

Explain your choice."	"  Yes, in this sentence, ""his"" refers to ""new groom.""  The sentence is using the possessive pronoun ""his"" to indicate that the new groom belongs to Sir Clifford. The phrase ""his new groom"" is modifying the noun ""groom,"" indicating that the speaker is referring to a new groom who is being sought by Sir Clifford.  For example, you could paraphrase the sentence as follows: ""Sir Clifford wants to find a new groom who will work with his old coachman and eventually take over his place when the old man retires."" In this paraphrased sentence, ""his"" is used to refer to the new groom, as he belongs to Sir Clifford."	162

"  Yes, in this sentence, ""it"" refers to ""The newspaper"".  The pronoun ""it"" is used to refer to a noun or pronoun that has been previously mentioned or specified in the text. In this sentence, ""The newspaper"" has been previously mentioned, so ""it"" refers to that noun.  The sentence ""Since it was raining"" implies that there is something (the rain) that is the subject of the sentence, and ""it"" is used to refer to that thing. The sentence ""I carried the newspaper over my backpack to keep it dry"" then clarifies what ""it"" refers to, which is ""The newspaper"".  Therefore, the correct answer is (A) The newspaper."	153	1.0

"  Yes, in this sentence, ""he"" refers to ""the con artist.""  The sentence states that if the con artist has succeeded in fooling Sam, then the con artist would have gotten a lot of money. This implies that ""he"" refers to the person who performed the action of fooling Sam, which is the con artist.  Alternatively, if ""he"" referred to Sam, the sentence would imply that Sam got a lot of money from the con artist, which doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence."	112

John laughed out quite loud. 'Served him right,' he said,"" the pronoun ""him"" refers to the boy.  The sentence suggests that the boy was being cruel to the pony, and the pony finally reacted by throwing him off its back. The phrase ""served him right"" implies that John thinks the boy deserved to be thrown off the pony for his mistreatment of the animal. Therefore, the pronoun ""him"" must refer to the boy, not the pony."	132

It was tasty,"" ""It"" does not refer to ""The worm.""  The pronoun ""It"" is used as a subject pronoun, meaning it refers to the subject of the sentence, which is ""fish."" The sentence should be read as ""The fish ate the worm. It was tasty.""  The use of ""It"" as a subject pronoun is common in informal language and in situations where the noun it refers to is clear from the context.

Here, ""he"" refers to the old man, as the sentence is referring to his understanding and action of giving Babar his wallet.

The sentence is written in a way that makes it clear that ""he"" is referring to the same person as ""patron.""  The sentence states that ""each artisan still had signs, not wishing to lose a possible patron merely because he happened to be illiterate."" Here, ""he"" is used to refer back to ""patron,"" which was mentioned earlier in the sentence. This is known as a pronoun reference, where a pronoun is used to refer back to a noun that was mentioned earlier in the sentence.  Additionally, the use of ""merely"" before ""because"" also suggests that ""he"" is referring to the same person as ""patron."" The phrase ""merely"" implies that the artisans are not willing to lose a potential customer simply because they are illiterate, and ""because"" indicates the reason why they are taking this precaution.  Therefore, based on the context and the grammatical structure of the sentence, it is clear that ""he"" refers to ""patron."""	232

""It"" refers to ""Tina's drawing"": In this interpretation, ""it"" refers back to ""Tina's drawing"" and means that Tina's drawing looked better with another one above it.

Explain your choice."	"  No, in the sentence ""Emma's mother had died long ago,"" ""her"" does not refer to ""Emma's mother.""  The pronoun ""her"" is used to refer to ""Emma"" throughout the sentence. The sentence starts by saying ""Emma's mother had died long ago,"" which implies that ""Emma"" is the subject of the sentence. Therefore, ""her"" refers to ""Emma,"" not ""Emma's mother.""

Here, ""her"" is used to refer to ""Emma"" again, emphasizing that ""Emma"" is the subject of the sentence.  So, to summarize, in the sentence ""Emma's mother had died long ago, and her education had been managed by an excellent woman as governess,"" ""her"" refers to ""Emma."""	217

"  Yes, in the sentence ""Of one thing Mark was sure. Harry knew much less than he did,"" the pronoun ""he"" refers to ""Mark.""  The sentence is using the contrastive structure ""Of one thing Mark was sure, Harry knew much less than he did"" to highlight the difference between Mark's knowledge and Harry's knowledge. In this context, ""he"" refers to the person who is being contrasted with Harry, which is Mark.  Therefore, ""he"" refers to Mark, and not Harry."	111

The pronoun ""they"" is ambiguous and could potentially refer to either ""tulip bulbs"" or ""onions,"" as both are mentioned in the sentence.  The context of the sentence makes it more likely that ""they"" refers to ""onions."" The sentence mentions that the speaker thought the tulip bulbs were onions, so it's reasonable to interpret ""they"" as referring to the onions.  If we were to assume that ""they"" refers to ""hamburgers,"" it would mean that the speaker cut up hamburgers in their food, which doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence.  Therefore, based on the context and the ambiguity of the pronoun ""they,"" it is more likely that ""they"" refers to ""onions"" in this sentence."	191

The pronoun ""them"" is used to refer to the hands that Fred covered his eyes with. The sentence states that Fred covered his eyes with his hands, so ""them"" is the correct referent.  The sentence does not provide any context to suggest that ""them"" refers to Fred's eyes.

"  Yes, in the sentence ""Sid explained his theory to Mark but he couldn't understand him,"" the pronoun ""he"" refers to ""Sid.""  The sentence is structured as a simple sentence with a subject (""Sid"") and a verb (""explained""). The verb is in the third person singular form, indicating that the subject is ""Sid."" The phrase ""but he couldn't understand him"" is a subordinate clause that provides additional information about the listener, ""Mark.""  Therefore, the pronoun ""he"" in the sentence refers to ""Sid,"" as it is the only ""he"" in the sentence."	136	0.6
1760601272	1760601275	"Tom gave Ralph a lift to school so he wouldn't have to drive alone.  In the sentence above, does ""he"" refer to ""Ralph""? Explain your choice."	"  No, in the sentence ""Tom gave Ralph a lift to school so he wouldn't have to drive alone,"" ""he"" does not refer to ""Ralph.""  The pronoun ""he"" is ambiguous in this sentence because it could refer to either ""Tom"" or ""Ralph."" To disambiguate, we need to consider the context and the grammatical structure of the sentence.  Since ""Tom"" is the subject of the sentence, it is more likely that ""he"" refers to ""Tom."" The sentence should be read as ""Tom gave Ralph a lift to school so that he wouldn't have to drive alone."" In this interpretation, ""he"" refers to ""Tom.""  Alternatively, if we read the sentence as ""Ralph gave Tom a lift to school so that he wouldn't have to drive alone,"" then ""he"" refers to ""Ralph."" However, this interpretation is less likely in this context because the sentence does not indicate that Ralph is the one who gave the lift to himself."	213

Nelly calls her her angel and she has good right to do so. her  In the sentence above, does ""her"" refer to ""mistress""? Explain your choice."	"  Yes, in the sentence above, ""her"" refers to ""mistress"".  The context of the sentence makes it clear that the speaker is referring to the same person as the one being mentioned earlier in the sentence, which is the ""kind mistress"". The speaker is expressing gratitude towards this person for taking care of them and their sister Nelly after their parents died.  The use of ""her"" to refer to ""mistress"" is also supported by the fact that the speaker uses the pronoun ""her"" to refer to ""mistress"" in the previous sentence, where they say ""without our kind mistress, we would have gone to the poorhouse"". This consistency in language use suggests that ""her"" is being used as a pronoun to refer back to the same person.  Therefore, in the sentence ""Nelly calls her her angel and she has good right to do so."", ""her"" refers to ""mistress""."	202

I showed the master the flies, some crushed and some crawling about helpless, and I showed him the wings on the window sill. I never saw him so angry before; but as Bill was still howling and whining, like the coward that he was, he did not give him any more punishment of that kind, but set him up on a stool for the rest of the afternoon, and said that he should not go out to play for that week.

The context of the sentence makes it clear that ""he"" is referring to the same person as ""the master."" The narrator is describing the events that happened after they showed the master the flies and their wings, so it is logical to assume that ""he"" is referring to the same person as ""the master.""  Additionally, the use of ""he"" in the sentence is consistent with the narrator's perspective, as they are describing what they saw and experienced. The use of ""he"" as a pronoun helps to maintain the flow of the narrative and avoids confusion."	139
