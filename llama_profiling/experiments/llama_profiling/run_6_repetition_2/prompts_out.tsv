1760549161	1760549163	Passage: Persian language -- Persian (/ˈpɜːrʒən, -ʃən/), also known by its endonym Farsi (فارسی fārsi (fɒːɾˈsiː) ( listen)), is one of the Western Iranian languages within the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family. It is primarily spoken in Iran, Afghanistan (officially known as Dari since 1958), and Tajikistan (officially known as Tajiki since the Soviet era), and some other regions which historically were Persianate societies and considered part of Greater Iran. It is written in the Persian alphabet, a modified variant of the Arabic script, which itself evolved from the Aramaic alphabet.  Question: do iran and afghanistan speak the same language  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, Iran and Afghanistan both have Persian as an official language. However, Afghanistan has officially known it as Dari since 1958. This suggests that while the language is the same, the official name used in Afghanistan is different from the one used in Iran.  So, to answer your question: Iran and Afghanistan do not exactly speak the same language, as Afghanistan has its own official name for the language (Dari), whereas Iran simply refers to it as Persian.
1760549163	1760549165	Passage: Good Samaritan law -- Good Samaritan laws offer legal protection to people who give reasonable assistance to those who are, or who they believe to be, injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. The protection is intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, for fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. An example of such a law in common-law areas of Canada: a good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing. Its purpose is to keep people from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in treatment. By contrast, a duty to rescue law requires people to offer assistance and holds those who fail to do so liable.  Question: do good samaritan laws protect those who help at an accident  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, I would answer: YES, good Samaritan laws protect those who help at an accident.  The passage states that good Samaritan laws offer legal protection to people who give reasonable assistance to those who are, or who they believe to be, injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. This includes situations where someone helps at an accident. The purpose of these laws is to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, for fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. Therefore, good Samaritan laws provide legal protection to those who help at an accident, allowing them to do so without fear of legal repercussions.
1760549165	1760549167	Passage: Windows Movie Maker -- Windows Movie Maker (formerly known as Windows Live Movie Maker in Windows 7) is a discontinued video editing software by Microsoft. It is a part of Windows Essentials software suite and offers the ability to create and edit videos as well as to publish them on OneDrive, Facebook, Vimeo, YouTube, and Flickr.  Question: is windows movie maker part of windows essentials  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, I would answer: Yes, Windows Movie Maker is part of Windows Essentials software suite.  The passage states: "Windows Movie Maker (formerly known as Windows Live Movie Maker in Windows 7) is a discontinued video editing software by Microsoft. It is a part of Windows Essentials software suite..."  This explicitly mentions that Windows Movie Maker is a part of Windows Essentials software suite.
1760549167	1760549168	Passage: Powdered sugar -- Powdered sugar, also called confectioners' sugar, icing sugar, and icing cake, is a finely ground sugar produced by milling granulated sugar into a powdered state. It usually contains a small amount of anti-caking agent to prevent clumping and improve flow. Although most often produced in a factory, powdered sugar can also be made by processing ordinary granulated sugar in a coffee grinder, or by crushing it by hand in a mortar and pestle.  Question: is confectionary sugar the same as powdered sugar  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, "Powdered sugar, also called confectioners' sugar, icing sugar, and icing cake..." This implies that confectioners' sugar is one of the alternative names for powdered sugar. Therefore, I would conclude that confectionary sugar and powdered sugar are the same thing.
1760549168	1760549171	Passage: The Elder Scrolls Online -- As with other games in The Elder Scrolls series, the game is set on the continent of Tamriel. The events of the game occur a millennium before those of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and around 800 years before The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. It has a broadly similar structure to Skyrim, with two separate conflicts progressing at the same time, one with the fate of the world in the balance, and one where the prize is supreme power on Tamriel. In The Elder Scrolls Online, the first struggle is against the Daedric Prince Molag Bal, who is attempting to meld the plane of Mundus with his realm of Coldharbour, and the second is to capture the vacant imperial throne, contested by three alliances of the mortal races. The player character has been sacrificed to Molag Bal, and Molag Bal has stolen their soul, the recovery of which is the primary game objective.  Question: is elder scrolls online the same as skyrim  Explain your choice.	No, The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) is not the same as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (ESO). Here's why:  * According to the passage, ESO occurs a millennium before the events of Skyrim, which means that ESO takes place in a different time period. * The passage also mentions that ESO has a similar structure to Skyrim, with two separate conflicts, but this does not mean that the games are identical. * The passage specifically states that the events of ESO occur around 800 years before the events of Morrowind and Oblivion, which are also part of the Elder Scrolls series. This further emphasizes that ESO is a separate game with its own unique story and setting, rather than being the same as Skyrim.  In summary, while ESO may share some similarities with Skyrim, such as its structure and setting, it is a distinct game with its own unique story, characters, and time period.
1760549171	1760549173	Passage: Epsom railway station -- Epsom railway station serves the town of Epsom in Surrey. It is located off Waterloo Road and is less than two minutes' walk from the High Street. It is not in the London Oyster card zone unlike Epsom Downs or Tattenham Corner stations. The station building was replaced in 2012/2013 with a new building with apartments above the station (see end of article).  Question: can you use oyster card at epsom station  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, the answer is NO, you cannot use an Oyster card at Epsom station. The passage states: "It is not in the London Oyster card zone unlike Epsom Downs or Tattenham Corner stations." This implies that Epsom station is not part of the London Oyster card network, and therefore, Oyster cards are not accepted at this station.
1760549173	1760549174	Passage: Da Vinci's Demons -- The series premiered in the United States on Starz on 12 April 2013, and its second season premiered on 22 March 2014. The series was renewed for a third season, which premiered on 24 October 2015. On 23 July 2015, Starz announced that the third season would be the show's last. However Goyer has left it open for a miniseries return.  Question: will there be a season 4 of da vinci's demons  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, it seems unlikely that there will be a Season 4 of Da Vinci's Demons. The passage states that the third season was announced to be the show's last, and while Goyer has left the door open for a potential miniseries return, there is no confirmation or indication that a fourth season is in the works.
1760549174	1760549176	Passage: Federal judiciary of the United States -- The federal courts are composed of three levels of courts. The Supreme Court of the United States is the court of last resort. It is generally an appellate court that operates under discretionary review, which means that the Court can choose which cases to hear, by granting writs of certiorari. There is therefore generally no basic right of appeal that extends automatically all the way to the Supreme Court. In a few situations (like lawsuits between state governments or some cases between the federal government and a state) it sits as a court of original jurisdiction.  Question: is the federal court the same as the supreme court  Explain your choice.	No, the federal court is not the same as the Supreme Court.  According to the passage, the federal judiciary of the United States is composed of three levels of courts, and the Supreme Court is one of those levels, specifically the court of last resort. The passage also states that the federal courts are composed of three levels of courts, implying that there are other courts below the Supreme Court. Therefore, the federal court refers to the entire system of courts, including the Supreme Court, while the Supreme Court is a specific court within that system.
1760549176	1760549178	Passage: Bixby letter -- In the 1998 war film Saving Private Ryan, General George Marshall (played by Harve Presnell) reads the Bixby letter to his officers before giving the order to find and send home Private James Francis Ryan after Ryan's three brothers died in battle.  Question: did abraham lincoln write the letter in saving private ryan  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, the answer is no, Abraham Lincoln did not write the letter in Saving Private Ryan. The passage mentions that General George Marshall (played by Harve Presnell) reads the Bixby letter to his officers. The Bixby letter was a real letter written by President Abraham Lincoln to Lydia Bixby, the mother of three sons who had died in the American Civil War. However, the context of the passage suggests that the letter is being read by General Marshall in the context of the film Saving Private Ryan, which is set during World War II, not the Civil War.
1760549178	1760549179	Passage: Batman & Robin (film) -- With the box office success of Batman Forever in June 1995, Warner Bros. immediately commissioned a sequel. They hired director Joel Schumacher and writer Akiva Goldsman to reprise their duties the following August, and decided it was best to fast track production for a June 1997 target release date, which is a break from the usual 3-year gap between films. Schumacher wanted to homage both the broad camp style of the 1960s television series and the work of Dick Sprang. The storyline of Batman & Robin was conceived by Schumacher and Goldsman during pre-production on A Time to Kill. Portions of Mr. Freeze's back-story were based on the Batman: The Animated Series episode ``Heart of Ice'', written by Paul Dini.  Question: is batman and robin a sequel to batman forever  Explain your choice.	Yes, Batman & Robin is a sequel to Batman Forever.  The passage states that Warner Bros. commissioned a sequel to Batman Forever in August 1995, and the film was released in June 1997. This indicates that Batman & Robin is a direct sequel to Batman Forever, as it was made shortly after the success of the previous film.
1760549179	1760549181	Passage: Badger -- Badgers are short-legged omnivores in the family Mustelidae, which also includes the otters, polecats, weasels, and wolverines. They belong to the caniform suborder of carnivoran mammals. The 11 species of badgers are grouped in three subfamilies: Melinae (Eurasian badgers), Mellivorinae (the honey badger or ratel), and Taxideinae (the American badger). The Asiatic stink badgers of the genus Mydaus were formerly included within Melinae (and thus Mustelidae), but recent genetic evidence indicates these are actually members of the skunk family, placing them in the taxonomic family Mephitidae.  Question: is a wolverine the same as a badger  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, wolverines are mentioned as part of the family Mustelidae, which also includes badgers. However, the passage does not state that wolverines are the same as badgers. In fact, wolverines are listed as a separate entity within the family Mustelidae, along with otters, polecats, and weasels.  Therefore, based on the passage, it can be inferred that wolverines are distinct from badgers, and are rather a different species within the same family.
1760549181	1760549183	Passage: Green Lantern (film) -- Green Lantern was released on June 17, 2011, and received generally negative reviews; most criticized the film for its screenplay, inconsistent tone, choice and portrayal of villains, and its use of CGI, while some praised Reynolds' performance. Reynolds would later voice his dissatisfaction with the film. The film underperformed at the box office, grossing $219 million against a production budget of $200 million. Due to the film's negative reception and disappointing box office performance, Warner Bros. canceled any plans for a sequel, instead opting to reboot the character in the DC Extended Universe line with the film Green Lantern Corps, set for release in 2020.  Question: will there be a green lantern 2 movie  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, the answer is no, there will not be a Green Lantern 2 movie. The passage states: "Due to the film's negative reception and disappointing box office performance, Warner Bros. canceled any plans for a sequel, instead opting to reboot the character in the DC Extended Universe line with the film Green Lantern Corps, set for release in 2020." This indicates that Warner Bros. decided to cancel the planned sequel and instead create a new film, Green Lantern Corps, which is a reboot of the character.
1760549183	1760549186	Passage: United States and the International Criminal Court -- The United States should have the chance to observe and assess the functioning of the court, over time, before choosing to become subject to its jurisdiction. Given these concerns, I will not, and do not recommend that my successor, submit the treaty to the Senate for advice and consent until our fundamental concerns are satisfied.  Question: does the icc has jurisdiction in the united states  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, the answer is NO, the ICC does not have jurisdiction in the United States.  The passage states that the speaker will not recommend submitting the treaty to the Senate for advice and consent until the United States' "fundamental concerns" are satisfied. This implies that the speaker is concerned about the ICC's jurisdiction over the United States and wants to ensure that the country's interests are protected before becoming subject to the court's jurisdiction.  The speaker's reluctance to submit the treaty to the Senate suggests that they are unwilling to accept the ICC's jurisdiction over the United States without certain guarantees or modifications to the treaty. This indicates that the ICC does not currently have jurisdiction over the United States, and the speaker is seeking to limit or prevent the ICC's jurisdiction over the country.
1760549186	1760549187	Passage: Calcium carbide -- Calcium carbide is a chemical compound with the chemical formula of CaC. Its main use industrially is in the production of acetylene and calcium cyanamide.  Question: calcium carbide cac2 is the raw material for the production of acetylene  Explain your choice.	I would say that the answer is incorrect.  According to the passage, calcium carbide has the chemical formula CaC2, not CaC, and its main use industrially is in the production of acetylene. This suggests that calcium carbide is the raw material for the production of acetylene, not CaC2.
1760549187	1760549187	Passage: Now You See Me (film series) -- Now You See Me is a series of heist thriller film written by Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin, and Edward Ricourt. They focus on the actions of a team of illusionists named ``The Four Horsemen'' who pull off near impossible heists. The series features an ensemble cast including Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Michael Caine, Lizzy Caplan, and Morgan Freeman. The first film was released in 2013, while the second was released in 2016, and a third film is currently in development and set to be released in 2019. The series has received mixed reviews from critics and audiences and grossed nearly $700 million worldwide.  Question: is there a now you see me 3 coming out  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, the answer is yes, a third film is currently in development and set to be released in 2019.
1760549187	1760549189	Passage: Penalty shoot-out (association football) -- A shoot-out is usually considered for statistical purposes to be separate from the match which preceded it. In the case of a two-legged fixture, the two matches are still considered either as two draws or as one win and one loss; in the case of a single match, it is still considered as a draw. This contrasts with a fixture won in extra time, where the score at the end of normal time is superseded. Converted shoot-out penalties are not considered as goals scored by a player for the purposes of their individual records, or for ``golden boot'' competitions.  Question: does a penalty shoot out goal count towards the golden boot  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, the answer is: No, a penalty shoot-out goal does not count towards the "golden boot" competitions.  The passage states: "Converted shoot-out penalties are not considered as goals scored by a player for the purposes of their individual records, or for ``golden boot'' competitions." This explicitly indicates that goals scored in a penalty shoot-out do not count towards a player's individual goal-scoring record or towards "golden boot" competitions.
1760549189	1760549190	Passage: Cutthroat Kitchen -- Cutthroat Kitchen is a cooking show hosted by Alton Brown that aired on the Food Network from August 11, 2013 to July 19, 2017. It features four chefs competing in a three-round elimination cooking competition. The contestants face auctions in which they can purchase opportunities to sabotage one another. Each chef is given $25,000 at the start of the show; the person left standing keeps whatever money they have not spent in the auctions. The show ended on its fifteenth season in July 2017. The series shares some basic elements with other four-chef, three-round elimination-style competitions on Food Network including Chopped and Guy's Grocery Games. Numerous Cutthroat Kitchen contestants have competed on these shows.  Question: will there be a new season of cutthroat kitchen  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, it appears that Cutthroat Kitchen ended its run on its 15th season in July 2017. There is no mention of a new season being planned or announced. The passage states that the show "ended" in July 2017, suggesting that it is no longer in production or airing new episodes. Therefore, it is unlikely that there will be a new season of Cutthroat Kitchen.
1760549190	1760549191	Passage: Jack Sikma -- In 2006, Sikma was voted as one of the 100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament, a group of former players and coaches in honor of the 100 anniversary of the IHSA boys basketball tournament. On June 27, 2017, Sikma was inducted into the Small College Basketball Hall of Fame as part of their second class . Inducted alongside Sikma were Zelmo Beaty, Walt Frazier, Bob Love, Elmore Smith, Jim Spivey, Rico Swanson, George Tinsley, and Al Tucker.  Question: is jack sikma in the hall of fame  Explain your choice.	Yes, Jack Sikma is in the hall of fame. According to the passage, Jack Sikma was inducted into the Small College Basketball Hall of Fame on June 27, 2017, as part of their second class.
1760549191	1760549193	Passage: Half-elven -- In J.R.R. Tolkien's fictional universe of Middle-earth, the Half-elven (Sindarin singular Peredhel, plural Peredhil, Quenya singular Perelda) are the children of the union of Elves and Men. Of these, the most significant were the products of couplings between the Eldar (the Elves who followed the Call to Valinor) and the Edain (the Men of the Three Houses of early Men who allied themselves with the Eldar in their war against Morgoth).  Question: can elves and humans mate lord of the rings  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, yes, elves and humans can mate in J.R.R. Tolkien's fictional universe of Middle-earth. The passage states that the Half-elven are the children of the union of Elves and Men, specifically the products of couplings between the Eldar (Elves) and the Edain (Men). This suggests that there is a possibility for interbreeding between Elves and Men, resulting in the creation of Half-elven offspring.
1760549193	1760549194	Passage: The Boy in the Plastic Bubble -- The Boy in the Plastic Bubble is a 1976 American made-for-television drama film inspired by the lives of David Vetter and Ted DeVita, who lacked effective immune systems. It stars John Travolta, Glynnis O'Connor, Diana Hyland, Robert Reed, Ralph Bellamy & P.J. Soles. It was written by Douglas Day Stewart, executive produced by Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg (who, at the time, produced Starsky and Hutch and Charlie's Angels), and directed by Randal Kleiser, who would work with Travolta again in Grease shortly after. The original music score was composed by Mark Snow. The theme song ``What Would They Say'' was written and sung by Paul Williams. William Howard Taft High School in Woodland Hills was used for filming.  Question: the boy in the plastic bubble based on true story  Explain your choice.	I choose "Yes" because the passage states that the film "The Boy in the Plastic Bubble" is "inspired by the lives of David Vetter and Ted DeVita, who lacked effective immune systems." This suggests that the film is based on a true story, specifically the lives of these two individuals who had compromised immune systems.
1760549194	1760549197	Passage: A priori and a posteriori -- These terms are used with respect to reasoning (epistemology) to distinguish ``necessary conclusions from first premises'' (i.e., what must come before sense observation) from ``conclusions based on sense observation'' (which must follow it). Thus, the two kinds of knowledge, justification, or argument, may be glossed:  Question: science begins with the premise that knowledge should first be acquired through observation  Explain your choice.	I would disagree with the passage's statement "science begins with the premise that knowledge should first be acquired through observation". The passage actually highlights the distinction between a priori and a posteriori reasoning, which is a philosophical concept, not a scientific one.  The passage explains that a priori knowledge is knowledge that is known independently of sense experience, whereas a posteriori knowledge is knowledge that is derived from sense experience. The passage does not suggest that science begins with the premise that knowledge should first be acquired through observation.  In fact, many scientific theories and discoveries are the result of a priori reasoning, where scientists use logical and mathematical principles to derive conclusions without relying solely on sense experience. For example, Einstein's theory of general relativity was developed using a priori reasoning, where he used mathematical equations to derive the theory, without relying on direct observation.  Therefore, the passage's statement is not accurate, and science does not necessarily begin with the premise that knowledge should first be acquired through observation.
1760549197	1760549198	Passage: Tim Brown (American football) -- Timothy Donell Brown (born July 22, 1966) is a former American football wide receiver who played professionally in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Notre Dame, where he won the Heisman Trophy, becoming the first wide receiver to win the award. He spent sixteen years with the Los Angeles/Oakland Raiders, during which he established himself as one of the NFL's most prolific wide receivers. Brown has also played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In 2015, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  Question: is tim brown in the hall of fame  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, yes, Tim Brown is in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The passage states: "In 2015, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame."
1760549198	1760549200	Passage: Drinking in public -- Drinking in public in Denmark is legal in general. The law forbids ``disturbing of the public law and order''. Thus general consumption is accepted. Several cafes have outdoor serving in the same zones.  Question: can you drink alcohol in public in denmark  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, the answer is:  YES, you can drink alcohol in public in Denmark.  The passage states that "drinking in public in Denmark is legal in general" and that the law only forbids "disturbing of the public law and order", implying that general consumption of alcohol in public is accepted. Additionally, it mentions that several cafes have outdoor serving in the same zones, suggesting that public drinking is a common and accepted practice in Denmark.
1760549200	1760549201	Passage: Jersey pound -- Both Jersey and Bank of England notes are legal tender in Jersey and circulate together, alongside the Guernsey pound and Scottish banknotes. The Jersey notes are not legal tender in the United Kingdom but are legal currency, so creditors and traders may accept them if they so choose.  Question: is jersey currency legal tender in the uk  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, the answer is: No, Jersey pound is not legal tender in the United Kingdom.  The passage states: "The Jersey notes are not legal tender in the United Kingdom but are legal currency..." This indicates that while the Jersey pound is a legitimate currency, it is not considered legal tender in the UK, meaning it is not automatically accepted as payment in the UK. However, creditors and traders may still choose to accept it as payment.
1760549201	1760549202	Passage: Milwaukee Bucks -- The Bucks have won one league title (1971), two conference titles (1971 and 1974), and 13 division titles (1971--1974, 1976, 1980--1986, 2001). They have featured such notable players as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Sidney Moncrief, Oscar Robertson, Bob Dandridge, Bob Lanier, Glenn Robinson, Ray Allen, Sam Cassell, Junior Bridgeman, Michael Redd, Terry Cummings, Vin Baker, Jon McGlocklin, Marques Johnson, and Brian Winters.  Question: have the milwaukee bucks ever won a championship  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, the answer is: Yes, the Milwaukee Bucks have won one league title (1971).
1760549202	1760549204	Passage: List of FIFA World Cup penalty shoot-outs -- This is a list of all penalty shoot-outs that have occurred in the Finals tournament of the FIFA World Cup. Penalty shoot-outs were introduced as tie-breakers in the 1978 World Cup but did not occur before 1982. The first time a World Cup title was won by penalty shoot-out was in 1994. The only other time was in 2006. By the end of the 2018 edition, 30 shoot-outs have taken place in the World Cup. Of these, only two reached the sudden death stage after still being tied at the end of ``best of five kicks''.  Question: does the world cup final go to penalties  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, the answer is: No, the World Cup final does not always go to penalties.  The passage states that "Penalty shoot-outs were introduced as tie-breakers in the 1978 World Cup but did not occur before 1982." This implies that before 1982, the World Cup final did not go to penalties. Additionally, the passage mentions that only two out of 30 penalty shoot-outs have reached the sudden death stage after still being tied at the end of "best of five kicks". This suggests that most penalty shoot-outs do not reach the final stages, and therefore the World Cup final does not always go to penalties.
1760549204	1760549205	Passage: Kingdom (manga) -- Kingdom (キングダム, Kingudamu) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yasuhisa Hara (原泰久, Hara Yasuhisa). The manga provides a fictionalized account of the Warring States period primarily through the experiences of the war orphan Xin and his comrades as he fights to become the greatest general under the heavens, and in doing so, unifying China for the first time in history. The series was adapted into a thirty-eight episode anime series by studio Pierrot that aired from June 4, 2012 to February 25, 2013. A second season was announced and aired from June 8, 2013 to March 1, 2014. An English language release of the anime was licensed by Funimation.  Question: is kingdom manga based on a true story  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, the answer is "no", Kingdom manga is not based on a true story. The passage states that the manga provides a "fictionalized account" of the Warring States period, which suggests that while it may be inspired by real events or draw from historical records, it is not a strictly factual or biographical account.
1760549205	1760549206	Passage: European Economic Area -- As of 2014 the contracting parties to the EEA are 3 of the 4 EFTA member states and 27 of the 28 EU member states. The 28th and newest EU member, Croatia, finished negotiating their accession to the EEA in November 2013, and since 12 April 2014 is provisionally applying the agreement pending its ratification by all EEA member states.  Question: is croatia part of the european economic area  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, Croatia is not yet a full member of the European Economic Area (EEA), but it has finished negotiating its accession and is provisionally applying the agreement pending its ratification by all EEA member states. Therefore, as of 2014, Croatia is not yet a full member of the EEA, but it is in the process of joining.
1760549206	1760549207	Passage: Posthumous marriage -- Posthumous marriage (or necrogamy) is a marriage in which one of the participating members is deceased. It is legal in France and similar forms are practiced in Sudan and China. Since World War I, France has had hundreds of requests each year, of which many have been accepted.  Question: can u marry a dead person in france  Explain your choice.	Yes, according to the passage, the answer is yes, it is legal to marry a dead person in France.
1760549207	1760549209	Passage: Saline (medicine) -- Saline, also known as saline solution, is a mixture of sodium chloride in water and has a number of uses in medicine. Applied to the affected area it is used to clean wounds, help remove contact lenses, and help with dry eyes. By injection into a vein it is used to treat dehydration such as from gastroenteritis and diabetic ketoacidosis. It is also used to dilute other medications to be given by injection.  Question: is saline and sodium chloride the same thing  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, I would say that saline and sodium chloride are not exactly the same thing, although they are closely related.  Saline refers to a mixture of sodium chloride (NaCl) in water, which means that saline is a solution that contains sodium chloride dissolved in water. Sodium chloride, on the other hand, is the chemical compound commonly known as table salt.  In other words, sodium chloride is the active ingredient in saline solution, but saline solution is a mixture of sodium chloride and water. The passage highlights the different uses of saline solution, which is the mixture, whereas sodium chloride is a chemical compound with its own properties and uses.  So, while saline and sodium chloride are related, they are not interchangeable terms.
1760549209	1760549211	Passage: Bubonic plague -- Several classes of antibiotics are effective in treating bubonic plague. These include aminoglycosides such as streptomycin and gentamicin, tetracyclines (especially doxycycline), and the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. Mortality associated with treated cases of bubonic plague is about 1--15%, compared to a mortality of 40--60% in untreated cases.  Question: is there a treatment for the bubonic plague  Explain your choice.	The correct answer is YES.  The passage states that "Several classes of antibiotics are effective in treating bubonic plague", which implies that there is a treatment available for the disease. Specifically, it mentions three classes of antibiotics that are effective: aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones. Additionally, the passage provides a comparison of mortality rates between treated and untreated cases, indicating that treatment can significantly improve outcomes.
1760549211	1760549212	Passage: Joyce Summers -- The premise of the series is that Buffy is the latest Slayer, a young woman endowed by mystical forces with superhuman powers to fight and defeat vampires, demons, and other evil forces in the fictional town of Sunnydale. Like every Slayer before her, she was chosen and informed of her destiny when she was 15 years old. Her mother is unaware of her daughter's powers and responsibilities until Buffy is forced to tell her at the end of the second season of the television series. Although Joyce is shocked at this revelation, she recovers quickly and remains a source of stability for Buffy and Buffy's small circle of friends who assist her, dubbed the Scooby Gang. Eventually Joyce is able to take Buffy's dangerous demon-fighting in stride and even become proud and respectful of her daughter's abilities. Her natural death from an illness in the fifth season forces Buffy to face becoming an adult.  Question: does buffy's mom know she's a slayer  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, no, Buffy's mom, Joyce Summers, is initially unaware of her daughter's powers and responsibilities as the Slayer. The passage states: "Her mother is unaware of her daughter's powers and responsibilities until Buffy is forced to tell her at the end of the second season of the television series."
1760549212	1760549214	Passage: Leaning Tower of Pisa -- The tower's tilt began during construction in the 12th century, caused by an inadequate foundation on ground too soft on one side to properly support the structure's weight. The tilt increased in the decades before the structure was completed in the 14th century. It gradually increased until the structure was stabilized (and the tilt partially corrected) by efforts in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.  Question: was the leaning tower of pisa built leaning  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, the answer is NO, the Leaning Tower of Pisa was not built leaning. The passage states that the tower's tilt "began during construction" in the 12th century, implying that it was not built leaning from the start. Instead, the tilt developed over time due to an inadequate foundation on soft ground, which increased in the decades before the structure was completed in the 14th century.
1760549214	1760549215	Passage: Fool's Gold (2008 film) -- Fool's Gold is a 2008 American adventure-romance film from Warner Bros. Pictures about a recently divorced couple who rekindle their romantic life while searching for a lost treasure. The film was directed by Andy Tennant and reunites the How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days stars Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson.  Question: is the movie fool's gold a true story  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, I would say that the movie Fool's Gold is not a true story. The passage states that it is an "American adventure-romance film" and that it is about a recently divorced couple searching for a lost treasure, which suggests that it is a work of fiction. Additionally, the passage mentions that the film stars Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson, who are known for their roles in romantic comedies, which further suggests that the movie is a work of fiction.
1760549215	1760549216	Passage: Super Bowl curse -- The home field curse affects the host team of the Super Bowl. So far no team has yet managed to reach the Super Bowl in their home stadium. Four teams with Super Bowls in their home venue have qualified for the divisional playoffs: the 1994 Miami Dolphins, the 1998 Miami Dolphins, the 2016 Houston Texans, and the 2017 Minnesota Vikings, the Vikings being the first to qualify for their conference's title game. From 1966--2011 (excluding the six Super Bowl games held in a stadium without a professional team), the Super Bowl host team has had 11 winning seasons, four split seasons, and 25 losing seasons. Mathematically, the probability of that many losing seasons or more occurring by chance (assuming a 50 percent chance of having a losing season (disregarding .500 seasons)) is 7.69 percent. It should be noted, however, that the Super Bowl host stadium is selected several years before the game is played, without regard to the teams that qualify.  Question: has any nfl team played the superbowl at home  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, the answer is NO. According to the passage, "So far no team has yet managed to reach the Super Bowl in their home stadium."
1760549216	1760549217	Passage: State constitution (Australia) -- In Australia, each state has its own constitution. Each state constitution preceded the Constitution of Australia as constitutions of the then separate British colonies, but all the states ceded powers to the Parliament of Australia as part of federation in 1901.  Question: does each australian state have its own constitution  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, the answer is:  **Yes**  The passage states that "each state has its own constitution", which suggests that each state in Australia has its own unique constitution.
1760549217	1760549219	Passage: Bundle branch block -- A bundle branch block can be diagnosed when the duration of the QRS complex on the ECG exceeds 120 ms. A right bundle branch block typically causes prolongation of the last part of the QRS complex, and may shift the heart's electrical axis slightly to the right. The ECG will show a terminal R wave in lead V1 and a slurred S wave in lead I. Left bundle branch block widens the entire QRS, and in most cases shifts the heart's electrical axis to the left. The ECG will show a QS or rS complex in lead V1 and a monophasic R wave in lead I. Another normal finding with bundle branch block is appropriate T wave discordance. In other words, the T wave will be deflected opposite the terminal deflection of the QRS complex. Bundle branch block, especially left bundle branch block, can lead to cardiac dyssynchrony. The simultaneous occurrence of left and right bundle branch block leads to total AV block.  Question: can you have a right and left bundle branch block  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, the answer is NO, you cannot have a simultaneous occurrence of a right and left bundle branch block.  The passage states: "The simultaneous occurrence of left and right bundle branch block leads to total AV block." This implies that when both the left and right bundle branches are blocked, it results in a more severe condition, specifically total AV block. It does not mention the possibility of having both conditions coexist simultaneously.  In other words, the passage suggests that when one bundle branch is blocked, it can be diagnosed and treated separately, but when both are blocked, it leads to a more serious condition.
1760549219	1760549220	Passage: Check (chess) -- In informal games, it is customary to announce ``check'' when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check. In formal competitions, however, check is rarely announced.  Question: do you always have to say check in chess  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, the answer is "no", you do not always have to say "check" in chess. In informal games, it is customary to announce "check" when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check, but in formal competitions, this is rarely done.
1760549220	1760549221	Passage: Australian Cattle Dog -- The Texas Heeler is a cross between the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Shepherd that was first registered with the Animal Research Foundation (ARF) in 1970. The ARF has registered Australian Cattle Dogs without papers as ``Australian Cattledog Queensland Heelers'' since 1965 and was the first organisation to recognise the Australian Shepherd. Although originally bred for its ability to work cattle, the Texas Heeler is increasingly used as a pet and a companion in dog sports. As with most cross breeds, the Texas Heeler's size and appearance is a variable combination of the parent breeds.  Question: is an australian shepherd the same as an australian cattle dog  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, the answer is NO, an Australian Shepherd is not the same as an Australian Cattle Dog.  The passage states that the Texas Heeler is a cross between the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Shepherd, implying that they are two distinct breeds. The Australian Cattle Dog is a specific breed, while the Australian Shepherd is another breed that is used as a parent breed in the creation of the Texas Heeler.
1760549221	1760549223	Passage: Tomato purée -- Tomato purée is a thick liquid made by cooking and straining tomatoes. The difference between tomato paste, tomato purée, and tomato sauce is consistency; tomato puree has a thicker consistency and a deeper flavour than sauce.  Question: is tomato puree and tomato sauce the same thing  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, my answer is:  No, tomato purée and tomato sauce are not the same thing.  The passage states that the difference between the two is consistency, with tomato purée having a thicker consistency than tomato sauce. Additionally, it mentions that tomato purée has a deeper flavor than tomato sauce. This suggests that while both may be made from cooked and strained tomatoes, they have distinct differences in terms of texture and taste.
1760549223	1760549225	Passage: The Blues Brothers -- The Blues Brothers are an American blues and soul revivalist band which was founded in 1978 by comedy actors Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi as part of a musical sketch on Saturday Night Live. Belushi and Aykroyd fronted the band, respectively in character as lead vocalist ``Joliet'' Jake Blues and harmonica player/vocalist Elwood Blues. The band was composed of well-known and respected musicians, and debuted as the musical guest on the April 22, 1978, episode of Saturday Night Live, opening the show performing ``Hey Bartender'', and later ``Soul Man''.  Question: is the blues brothers based on a true story  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, the answer is "No", the Blues Brothers are not based on a true story. The passage states that the band was "founded" by Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi as part of a musical sketch on Saturday Night Live, which implies that the band was created as a fictional entity for the purposes of the sketch. The passage also describes the band's debut performance on Saturday Night Live, which further reinforces the idea that the Blues Brothers are a fictional band created for entertainment purposes rather than being based on a true story.
1760549225	1760549226	Passage: Newcastle upon Tyne -- Newcastle upon Tyne (locally /njuːˈkæsəl/ ( listen)), commonly known as Newcastle, is a city in Tyne and Wear, North East England, 103 miles (166 km) south of Edinburgh and 277 miles (446 km) north of London on the northern bank of the River Tyne, 8.5 mi (13.7 km) from the North Sea. Newcastle is the most populous city in the North East, and forms the core of the Tyneside conurbation, the eighth most populous urban area in the United Kingdom. Newcastle is a member of the English Core Cities Group and is a member of the Eurocities network of European cities.  Question: is newcastle upon tyne the same as newcastle  Explain your choice.	The passage states: "Newcastle upon Tyne (locally /njuːˈkæsəl/ (listen)), commonly known as Newcastle..."  This suggests that "Newcastle" is a nickname or a shortened form of the full name "Newcastle upon Tyne". The passage does not explicitly state that they are the same, but the use of "commonly known as" implies that they are synonymous.

These include a variety of ordinary and guaranteed services both for delivery within the United Kingdom and to international destinations. Postage stamps (including commemorative stamps and other philatelic items) are sold, while applications for redirection of mail are accepted on behalf of Royal Mail.  Question: is post office and royal mail the same  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, I would say that Post Office Ltd and Royal Mail Group are not the same, but they are related.  The passage states that the Post Office provides services on behalf of the two collection and delivery divisions of Royal Mail Group, which are Royal Mail and Parcelforce. This implies that Royal Mail Group is the parent company or organization, while the Post Office is a subsidiary or a partner that provides services on behalf of Royal Mail Group.  Additionally, the passage mentions that the Post Office accepts postal items and payment on behalf of Royal Mail and Parcelforce, suggesting that the Post Office is a distribution channel for Royal Mail and Parcelforce, rather than being the same entity.  Therefore, while the Post Office and Royal Mail are closely connected, they are not the same entity.
1760549229	1760549231	Passage: Unsuccessful nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States -- Justices are nominated by the president and then confirmed by the U.S. Senate. A nomination to the Court is considered to be official when the Senate receives a signed nomination letter from the president naming the nominee, which is then entered in the Senate's record. There have been 37 unsuccessful nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States. Of these, 11 nominees were rejected in Senate roll-call votes, 11 were withdrawn by the president, and 15 lapsed at the end of a session of Congress. Six of these unsuccessful nominees were subsequently nominated and confirmed to other seats on the Court. Additionally, although confirmed, seven nominees either declined office or (in one instance) died before assuming office.

1760549238	1760549238	Passage: Euro sign -- The euro sign (€) is the currency sign used for the euro, the official currency of the Eurozone in the European Union (EU). The design was presented to the public by the European Commission on 12 December 1996. The international three-letter code (according to ISO standard ISO 4217) for the euro is EUR. In Unicode it is encoded at U+20AC € euro sign (HTML &#8364; &euro; ). In English, the sign precedes the value (for instance, €10, not 10 €, unlike most other European languages). In some style guides, but not others, the euro sign is unspaced.  Question: does the euro sign go before the number  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, in English, the euro sign "precedes the value", which means it comes before the number. For example, €10, not 10 €.
1760549238	1760549239	Passage: Induction cooking -- For nearly all models of induction cooktops, a cooking vessel must be made of, or contain, a ferrous metal such as cast iron or some stainless steels. The iron in the pot concentrates the current to produce heat in the metal. If the metal is too thin, or does not provide enough resistance to current flow, heating will not be effective. Most induction tops will not heat copper or aluminum vessels because the magnetic field cannot produce a concentrated current; ``all metal'' induction tops use much higher frequencies to overcome that effect. Any vessel can be used if placed on a suitable metal disk which functions as a conventional hotplate.  Question: can stainless steel be used on induction cooktop  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, the answer is "yes", stainless steel can be used on an induction cooktop, as long as it is a ferrous stainless steel. The passage states that "some stainless steels" can be used, implying that not all stainless steels are suitable, but some types are.
1760549239	1760549241	Passage: Dismissal (employment) -- ``Firing'' is a common colloquial term in the English language (particularly used in the U.S.) for termination. The term ``firing'' may have been initiated in the 1910s at the National Cash Register Company. Other terms for dismissal are being ``sacked'', ``canned'', ``let go'', ``ran-off'', ``axed'', ``given walking papers'', ``given the pink slip'' or ``boned''. Other terms, more often used in Commonwealth countries, include ``to get the boot'' and ``to get the sack''.  Question: is job termination the same as being fired  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, "dismissal" and "firing" are often used interchangeably to refer to job termination. Therefore, I would say that yes, job termination is the same as being fired. The passage mentions that "firing" is a colloquial term for termination, and "dismissal" is a more formal term for the same concept.
1760549241	1760549242	Passage: Inattentional blindness -- In a 2015 study, Cary Stothart, Walter Boot, and Daniel Simons attempted to replicate and extend the findings from both Graham and Burke's 2011 study and Steven Most and colleague's 2000 study on Amazon Mechanical Turk using a sample of 515 participants that varied in age. In this study, participants were tasked with counting the number of times a number of white moving objects crossed the vertical midpoint of a display while ignoring a number of black moving objects. The unexpected object in this case was a gray cross that moved horizontally across the display at various distances from the vertical midpoint (this was manipulated between participants). Overall, they found that inattentional blindness susceptibility increases with age, which replicates the finding from Graham and Burke. In fact, they found that every 10 years of age was associated with a 1.3 fold increase in the probability of displaying inattentional blindness. They also found that the probability of inattentional blindness increases as the distance between the observer's focus of attention and the unexpected object increases, which replicates the finding from Most and colleagues. However, they also found that the relationship that age has with inattentional blindness does not change as a function of the unexpected object's distance from the focus of attention, suggesting that useful field of view does not mediate the relationship between age and inattentional blindness.  Question: does age have any influence on attentional ability or inattentional blindness  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, yes, age has an influence on inattentional blindness, not attentional ability. The study found that inattentional blindness susceptibility increases with age, with every 10 years of age associated with a 1.3-fold increase in the probability of displaying inattentional blindness. This suggests that as people get older, they are more likely to be oblivious to unexpected objects in their visual field, even when they are focused on a specific task.
1760549242	1760549244	Passage: Sanskrit -- Sanskrit belongs to the Indo-European family of languages. It is one of the three ancient documented languages that likely arose from a common root language now referred to as the Proto-Indo-European language:  Question: is sanskrit the first language of the world  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, it can be inferred that Sanskrit is not the first language of the world. The passage states that Sanskrit "likely arose from a common root language now referred to as the Proto-Indo-European language", which implies that Proto-Indo-European was the earliest language from which Sanskrit and other languages in the Indo-European family evolved. Therefore, Sanskrit is not the first language of the world, but rather one of the languages that emerged from a common ancestral language.

Based on the passage, the answer is: NO, the Air Force does not usually have fighter aircraft escort the presidential aircraft over the United States.  The passage states that the Air Force "usually" does not have fighter aircraft escort the presidential aircraft over the United States, implying that it is not a standard practice. However, it does mention that it has occurred in rare instances, such as during the attack on the World Trade Center, suggesting that it is not a common occurrence.
1760549247	1760549250	Passage: AR-15s in California -- The Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989 banned Colt AR-15 rifles by name in the State of California. California's 2000 Assault Weapons ban went further and banned AR-15s made by other manufacturers by name such as Bushmaster, PWA, and Olympic Arms.  Question: is it legal to own an ar15 in california  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, it is not legal to own an AR-15 in California, at least not an AR-15 made by Colt, Bushmaster, PWA, or Olympic Arms. The passage states that the 1989 Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act banned Colt AR-15 rifles by name, and the 2000 Assault Weapons ban banned AR-15s made by other manufacturers by name, including Bushmaster, PWA, and Olympic Arms.  It is possible that there may be other AR-15s that are legal to own in California, such as those made by other manufacturers that were not specifically banned by name. However, the passage does not provide information about the legality of owning AR-15s made by other manufacturers.  It's important to note that gun laws can change over time, and it's always best to check with the relevant authorities or a qualified legal professional to determine the current legal status of owning an AR-15 in California.
1760549250	1760549252	Passage: The Star-Spangled Banner -- ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' is the national anthem of the United States.

1760549254	1760549256	Passage: Homologous chromosome -- A couple of homologous chromosomes, or homologs, are a set of one maternal and one paternal chromosome that pair up with each other inside a cell during meiosis. Homologs have the same genes in the same loci where they provide points along each chromosome which enable a pair of chromosomes to align correctly with each other before separating during meiosis. This is the basis for Mendelian inheritance which characterizes inheritance patterns of genetic material from an organism to its offspring parent developmental cell at the given time and area.  Question: do homologous chromosomes carry information for the same traits  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, homologous chromosomes have the same genes in the same loci, which means they carry the same information for the same traits. The passage states that "homologs have the same genes in the same loci", indicating that the genes on the maternal and paternal chromosomes are identical, but not necessarily identical copies of each other.

1760549256	1760549258	Passage: Waiter Rule -- The Waiter Rule refers to a common belief that one's true character can be gleaned from how one treats staff or service workers, such as a ``waiter''. The rule was one of William H Swanson's 33 Unwritten Rules of Management, copied from Dave Barry's version ``If someone is nice to you but rude to the waiter, they are not a nice person.''  Question: you can tell a lot about a person by how they treat their waiter  Explain your choice.	I chose the option: "you can tell a lot about a person by how they treat their waiter"  My reasoning is based on the passage, which states that the "Waiter Rule" refers to the idea that one's true character can be gauged by how they treat staff or service workers, such as a waiter. This suggests that the way someone behaves towards a waiter can reveal their personality, values, and character.
1760549258	1760549259	Passage: American crocodile -- Within the United States, the American crocodile's distribution is limited to the southern tip of Florida, though at least two have been found as far north as the Tampa Bay area. The current US population, estimated at 2,000, represents a significant recovery from a few hundred in the 1970s.  Question: are there any crocodiles native to north america  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, the answer is:  No, there are no crocodiles native to most of North America. According to the passage, the American crocodile's distribution is limited to the southern tip of Florida, and even then, it's only a small population.
1760549259	1760549261	Passage: Lex Luthor (Smallville) -- Season seven displayed Lex's descent into darkness; he has a brother-like relationship with Grant Gabriel (Michael Cassidy), the new editor of the Daily Planet newest editor, until it's revealed Grant is actually a clone of Lex's late brother. After Lex buys the Daily Planet, Grant attempts to keep Lex from being controlling, thus Lex has his brother's clone murdered and staged as a failed mugging. Lex then discovers that the previous symbols are connected to the secret organization Veritas, which his father is a part of. The Veritas members learned that an alien visitor known as ``The Traveler'' would arrive in Smallville during the meteor shower of 1989. At this time, Lex realizes that Lionel has been covering up the Traveler's existence and subsequently kills his own father for it. He eventually discovers that the Veritas members knew of a means to control the Traveler, so Lex sets out to find the device. The device, an orb he finds in the mantle above a fireplace in the Luthor mansion, leads Lex to the Fortress of Solitude, where he is confronted by Clark. Having finally discovered Clark's secret, Lex uses the orb to bring down the Fortress around Clark and himself.  Question: does lex luthor know who superman is in smallville  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, it can be inferred that Lex Luthor does not know that Clark Kent is Superman in the Smallville series. The passage states that Lex discovers the Fortress of Solitude and is confronted by Clark, but it does not mention Lex knowing Clark's secret identity as Superman. In fact, the passage suggests that Lex only discovers the truth about Clark's powers and the Fortress of Solitude after he finds the orb and uses it to bring down the Fortress. This implies that Lex was unaware of Clark's superhuman abilities and identity as Superman until this point.
1760549261	1760549263	Passage: Admission to the bar in the United States -- In the canonical case, lawyers seeking admission must earn a Juris Doctor degree from a law school approved by the jurisdiction, and then pass a bar exam administered by it. Typically, there is also a character and fitness evaluation, which includes a background check. However, there are exceptions to each of these requirements. A lawyer who is admitted in one state is not automatically allowed to practice in any other. Some states have reciprocal agreements that allow attorneys from other states to practice without sitting for another full bar exam; such agreements differ significantly among the states.  Question: do you have to have a college degree to take the bar exam  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, it does not explicitly state that you need a college degree to take the bar exam. However, it does mention that lawyers seeking admission must earn a Juris Doctor degree from a law school approved by the jurisdiction. This implies that a college degree is a prerequisite for pursuing a Juris Doctor degree, which is a graduate degree.  Therefore, I would conclude that having a college degree is a necessary step in preparing for and taking the bar exam in the United States.

1760549263	1760549265	Passage: Toll-free telephone numbers in the North American Numbering Plan -- In the United States of America, Canada, and other countries participating in the North American Numbering Plan, a toll-free telephone number has one of the area codes 800, 833, 844, 855, 866, 877, and 888.  Question: is 844 a toll free number in canada  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, the answer is:  YES, 844 is a toll-free number in Canada.  The passage states that a toll-free telephone number has one of the area codes 800, 833, 844, 855, 866, 877, and 888, which includes 844. Since Canada is participating in the North American Numbering Plan, it is likely that 844 is a toll-free number in Canada as well.
1760549265	1760549266	Passage: Daylight saving time by country -- Most areas in North America and Europe, and some areas in the Middle East, observe daylight saving time (DST), while most areas of Africa and Asia do not. In South America, most countries in the north of the continent near the equator do not observe DST, while Paraguay and southern parts of Brazil do. The practice of observing daylight saving time in Oceania is also mixed, with New Zealand and parts of southeastern Australia observing DST, while most other areas do not.  Question: does any other country have daylight savings time  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, I would say that yes, other countries have daylight saving time. The passage mentions that:  * Most areas in North America and Europe observe DST * Some areas in the Middle East observe DST * Paraguay and southern parts of Brazil observe DST * New Zealand and parts of southeastern Australia observe DST  This suggests that not all countries in these regions observe DST, but some do.

He played in Major League Baseball as a pitcher, most notably for the Cincinnati Reds.

1760549267	1760549268	Passage: Black Bike Week -- Black Bike Week, also called Atlantic Beach Bikefest and Black Bikers Week, is an annual motorcycle rally in the Myrtle Beach, South Carolina area, held on Memorial Day weekend. It is also sometimes called Black Fill-in-the-Blank Week, because it has evolved to attract many non-motorcycling visitors who come for music, socializing and enjoying the beach. Events include motorcycle racing, concerts, parties, and street festivals. Called a ``one-of-a-kind event'' and ``an exhibitionist's paradise'' by Jeffrey Gettleman, Black Bike Week is ``all about riding, styling and profiling,'' in the words of Mayor Irene Armstrong of Atlantic Beach, South Carolina.  Question: is there a black bike week in myrtle beach  Explain your choice.	The answer is: Yes, there is a Black Bike Week in Myrtle Beach.  My reasoning is based on the passage, which states: "Black Bike Week, also called Atlantic Beach Bikefest and Black Bikers Week, is an annual motorcycle rally in the Myrtle Beach, South Carolina area, held on Memorial Day weekend." This clearly indicates that Black Bike Week takes place in the Myrtle Beach area, specifically in Atlantic Beach, South Carolina.

Question: are static shock and black lightning the same person  Explain your choice.	No, Static and Black Lightning are not the same person.  The passage states that Static teamed up with Black Lightning, which implies that they are two separate individuals. Additionally, Black Lightning is a well-known superhero in the DC Comics universe, created by writer Tony Isabella and artist Trevor Von Eeden, while Static is a character from the Milestone Media universe, created by Dwayne McDuffie, Denys Cowan, and John Paul Leon. The two characters are from different comic book universes and have distinct origins, powers, and personalities.  Therefore, it can be concluded that Static and Black Lightning are not the same person, but rather two separate superheroes who have teamed up to stop a common villain.
1760549271	1760549273	Passage: Unbreakable glass -- Unbreakable glass is glass, or glass substitute, which does not display the normal fragility of glass - in general the term is not used to refer to something that is absolutely unbreakable.  Question: is there such a thing as unbreakable glass  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, the term "unbreakable glass" does not necessarily refer to something that is absolutely unbreakable. It seems to imply that "unbreakable glass" is a term that describes glass or a glass substitute that is not as fragile as regular glass, rather than something that is completely indestructible.  Therefore, I would answer the question by saying that there is no such thing as truly unbreakable glass, but rather, "unbreakable glass" is a term that refers to glass or a glass substitute that is more resistant to breakage than regular glass.
1760549273	1760549274	Passage: Liquid latex -- As the latex dries it becomes very sticky and will stick to itself if accidentally folded over. Most manufacturers offer a slick spray for latex once it is dry to take away the stickiness allowing the movement of the model's limbs. Alternatively, shimmer powders can be dusted over dried liquid latex to create metallic effects. One advantage to the tackiness of liquid latex is that it can act as an adhesive to attach things to the paint, such as zippers.  Question: can liquid latex be used as an adhesive  Explain your choice.	Yes, liquid latex can be used as an adhesive. According to the passage, one advantage of the tackiness of liquid latex is that it can act as an adhesive to attach things to the paint, such as zippers.
1760549274	1760549276	Passage: Gun laws in Texas -- Gov. Perry also signed H.B. 1815 after passage by the 2007 Legislature, a bill that allows any Texas resident to carry a handgun in the resident's motor vehicle without a CHL or other permit. The bill revised Chapter 46, Section 2 of the Penal Code to state that it is in fact not ``Unlawful Carry of a Weapon'', as defined by the statute, for a person to carry a handgun while in a motor vehicle they own or control, or to carry while heading directly from the person's home to that car. However, lawful carry while in a vehicle requires these four critical qualifiers: (1) the weapon must not be in plain sight (in Texas law, ``plain sight'' and ``concealed'' are mutually exclusive opposing terms); (2) the carrier cannot be involved in criminal activities, other than Class C traffic misdemeanors; (3) the carrier cannot be prohibited by state or federal law from possessing a firearm; and (4) the carrier cannot be a member of a criminal gang.  Question: is it illegal to carry a pistol in your car in texas  Explain your choice.	According to the passage, it is NOT illegal to carry a handgun in a motor vehicle in Texas, as long as the person meets the following conditions:  1. The weapon is not in plain sight. 2. The person is not involved in criminal activities, other than Class C traffic misdemeanors. 3. The person is not prohibited by state or federal law from possessing a firearm. 4. The person is not a member of a criminal gang.  The passage states that this was made possible by H.B. 1815, which revised Chapter 46, Section 2 of the Penal Code to clarify that carrying a handgun in a motor vehicle is not considered "Unlawful Carry of a Weapon" under Texas law.

Therefore, it is legal to carry a sgian-dubh in these countries, as long as it is worn as part of the national dress of Scotland.
1760549279	1760549281	Passage: Hypoglossal nerve -- The hypoglossal nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve, and innervates all the extrinsic and intrinsic muscles of the tongue, except for the palatoglossus which is innervated by the vagus nerve. It is a nerve with a solely motor function. The nerve arises from the hypoglossal nucleus in the brain stem as a number of small rootlets, passes through the hypoglossal canal and down through the neck, and eventually passes up again over the tongue muscles it supplies into the tongue. There are two hypoglossal nerves in the body: one on the left, and one on the right.  Question: several cranial nerves innervate structures of the tongue  Explain your choice.	I would answer "False" to the question.  According to the passage, the hypoglossal nerve innervates all the extrinsic and intrinsic muscles of the tongue, except for the palatoglossus which is innervated by the vagus nerve. This implies that only two cranial nerves innervate structures of the tongue: the hypoglossal nerve and the vagus nerve.

Question: is porto rico a part of the united states  Explain your choice.	Based on the passage, the answer is:  NO, Porto Rico (also known as Puerto Rico) is not a part of the United States in the classical sense.
