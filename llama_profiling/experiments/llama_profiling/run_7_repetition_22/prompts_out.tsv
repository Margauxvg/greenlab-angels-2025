1760554150	1760554154	Premise: It was a complex language. Not written down but handed down. One might say it was peeled down.  Hypothesis: the language was peeled down  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	A clever puzzle!  The premise states that the language was "peeled down", which could be interpreted in multiple ways. However, the key to this puzzle is to understand the word "peeled down" as a metaphorical expression, rather than a literal one.  The phrase "peeled down" is often used to describe the process of stripping away layers or simplifying a complex system or concept. In this context, it implies that the language was not written down in its original form, but rather was transmitted orally, with the complexity of the language being "peeled away" or stripped down to its essential components.  Given this interpretation, the premise does indeed entail the hypothesis. The premise states that the language was not written down, and the hypothesis "the language was peeled down" suggests that the language was transmitted orally, which is consistent with the premise.  In other words, the premise provides a necessary condition (the language was not written down), and the hypothesis provides a plausible explanation for how that might have happened (the language was peeled down).
1760554154	1760554157	Premise: It is part of their religion, a religion I do not scoff at as it holds many elements which match our own even though it lacks the truth of ours. At one of their great festivals they have the ritual of driving out the devils from their bodies. First the drummers come on - I may say that no women are allowed to take part in this ritual and the ladies here will perhaps agree with me that they are fortunate in that omission.  Hypothesis: no women are allowed to take part in this ritual  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	A nice philosophical question!  The premise states: "First the drummers come on - I may say that no women are allowed to take part in this ritual and the ladies here will perhaps agree with me that they are fortunate in that omission."  The premise does not directly entail the hypothesis "no women are allowed to take part in this ritual". The premise only says that the speaker may say that no women are allowed to take part, and that the ladies might agree with this statement. This implies that the speaker is making a claim, but it is not a fact that is necessarily true.  The premise does not provide any evidence or information that actually confirms the hypothesis. It is possible that women are allowed to participate in the ritual, and the speaker is simply making a speculation or opinion. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  To establish the hypothesis as true, additional evidence or information would be needed, such as direct statements from the religion's leaders or participants, or descriptions of the ritual that explicitly exclude women from participating.
1760554157	1760554161	Premise: The Paris to Rouen railway was being extended to Le Havre, and the line cut straight through Dr Flaubert's land. Part of it was to be compulsorily purchased. You could say that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy.  Hypothesis: Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that the extension of the railway line through Dr. Flaubert's land led to his creative retreat at Croisset, and that this event was somehow related to his epilepsy. The hypothesis specifically states that his epilepsy was the reason for his creative retreat at Croisset.  The premise provides the context for the hypothesis, suggesting that the stress or disruption caused by the railway line being built through his land may have triggered or exacerbated his epilepsy, leading him to retreat to Croisset. The premise implies a causal link between the railway line and Flaubert's retreat, which is supported by the hypothesis.  In other words, the premise provides the "what" (the railway line being built through Flaubert's land) and the hypothesis provides the "why" (his epilepsy) for why he retreated to Croisset. Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis, as it provides the necessary conditions for the hypothesis to be true.
1760554161	1760554164	Premise: Part of it was to be compulsorily purchased. You could say that Gustave was shepherded into creative retreat at Croisset by epilepsy. You could also say he was driven there by the railway.  Hypothesis: Gustave was driven to creative retreat in Croisset by the railway  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	A delightful question!  The premise states that part of Gustave's journey to Croisset was to be "compulsorily purchased" and that he was "shepherded into creative retreat" by epilepsy. This suggests that Gustave's move to Croisset was a result of external circumstances, specifically his epilepsy, rather than his own agency.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that Gustave was driven to Croisset by the railway. This implies that Gustave made a conscious decision to travel to Croisset, and the railway was the means by which he got there.  Since the premise implies that Gustave was not in control of his decision to move to Croisset, whereas the hypothesis suggests that he was, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The two statements are mutually exclusive, and the premise does not provide evidence for the hypothesis.  In other words, the premise does not support the idea that Gustave chose to travel to Croisset by railway, as it implies that he was forced to go there due to his epilepsy.
1760554164	1760554167	Premise: Some of them, like for instance the farm in Connecticut, are quite small. If I like a place I buy it. I guess you could say it's a hobby.  Hypothesis: buying places is a hobby  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise does not entail the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states that the speaker buys places, such as farms, and describes it as a "hobby". However, the premise does not provide any evidence or logical connection between the act of buying places and the idea that buying places is a hobby. A hobby is typically an activity that one engages in for enjoyment or recreation, but the premise only states that the speaker buys places, without describing the motivations or benefits they derive from doing so.  For example, the speaker might buy places for investment purposes, or for personal or professional reasons, rather than for enjoyment or recreation. The premise does not provide enough information to conclude that buying places is a hobby in the classical sense.
1760554167	1760554170	Premise: Look, my dear, I'm not in my dotage yet, and I know I'm a grumbler and a complainer. You could say the only form of comfort I 've got are my complaints.  Hypothesis: the only form of comfort he has are his complaints  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states that the speaker is a grumbler and a complainer, and that the only form of comfort they have are their complaints. This suggests that the speaker finds comfort or solace in their complaints, which is exactly what the hypothesis states.  In other words, the premise provides evidence that supports the hypothesis. The speaker's grumbling and complaining are not just a habit or a character trait, but a coping mechanism that brings them comfort. This implies that the hypothesis is true: the only form of comfort the speaker has is indeed their complaints.  In this case, the premise is a more specific statement that provides more detail about the speaker's behavior and its underlying motivation, which supports the broader claim made in the hypothesis.
1760554170	1760554172	Premise: Then the silence in the Zoo became complete. Woil stared around him and then suddenly with a push of his wings raised himself into the air, turned, and landed ten feet away on the back of a green bench. Creggan could see that he was afraid and that his fear was making him terribly uncertain.  Hypothesis: Woil was afraid  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that "Creggan could see that he was afraid", which suggests that Woil's behavior and body language (e.g. "stared around him" and "his fear was making him terribly uncertain") are indicative of fear. Additionally, the fact that Woil "pushed with his wings" to raise himself into the air and then landed on a bench suggests that he is exhibiting a sudden and unusual behavior, which is also consistent with the hypothesis that he is afraid. The combination of Woil's physical actions and Creggan's observation of his fear suggests that the hypothesis is supported by the premise.
1760554172	1760554174	Premise: But, of course, that just wasn't possible. Her disappointment over Jonathan, which had driven her to France in the first place, had been relegated somewhere to the back of her mind. Now in retrospect she could see that marriage to him would have been a ghastly mistake and that her reaction to discovering that he had been seeing other women while he had been engaged to her had had far more to do with wounded pride than with a wounded heart.  Hypothesis: marriage to Jonathan would have been a ghastly mistake  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that the narrator's disappointment over Jonathan, which drove her to France, had been relegated to the back of her mind, and that in retrospect, she can see that marriage to him would have been a "ghastly mistake". This suggests that the narrator has come to realize that her initial feelings of disappointment and hurt were justified, and that marrying Jonathan would not have been a good decision for her. The hypothesis "marriage to Jonathan would have been a ghastly mistake" is directly implied by the premise, as it is the narrator's newfound understanding of her situation.
1760554174	1760554178	Premise: Like now. The Community in Knockglen would defend Eve vociferously. Even some of the Sisters here in Dublin might see that the girl had a point.  Hypothesis: the girl had a point  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise states that "the Community in Knockglen would defend Eve vociferously", which implies that they strongly support her. The premise also mentions that "some of the Sisters here in Dublin might see that the girl had a point", which suggests that there is a possibility that Eve's argument has some validity.  The hypothesis, "the girl had a point", is a statement about the validity of Eve's argument. The premise does not explicitly state that the girl's point is valid, but it does imply that there is a possibility that it is. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as it only provides a hint that there might be some validity to Eve's argument, but does not necessarily confirm it.  In other words, the premise sets up a scenario where Eve's argument is likely to be defended by the Community in Knockglen, but it does not guarantee that her point is actually valid. The hypothesis is a separate claim that requires additional evidence or reasoning to be confirmed or rejected.
1760554178	1760554179	Premise: ``They have to be crushed, Bobkins!'' So saying, she marched off down the gravel path, making the kind of crunching noise Robert had thought could only be produced by the BBC sound-effects department. As they rounded the edge of the building he could see that behind the house was a vast garden.  Hypothesis: behind the house was a vast garden  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that as they rounded the edge of the building, they could see that behind the house was a vast garden. This directly implies that the garden is indeed behind the house, which is the hypothesis. The premise is providing evidence or support for the hypothesis, effectively entailing it.
1760554179	1760554181	Premise: ``Do you mind if I use your phone?'' Ronni could see that Guido's brain was whirring.  Hypothesis: Guido's brain was whirring  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that "Ronni could see that Guido's brain was whirring", which means that Ronni has observed Guido's brain whirring. This observation is the evidence that supports the hypothesis that Guido's brain was whirring. Since the premise provides the evidence, it entails the hypothesis. In other words, the premise implies that Guido's brain was whirring, making the hypothesis true.
1760554181	1760554182	Premise: ``Look, lady, give me a break. I just deliver the stuff, I don't interview it for the Sunday papers.'' He waved the paper at her and even at a distance she could see that it said very little.  Hypothesis: the paper said very little  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that the paper says very little, and the person is waving it at the lady to emphasize that point. This implies that the paper does not contain a significant amount of information, and the person is suggesting that the lady should not expect a detailed or substantial report from it. Therefore, the premise directly supports the hypothesis that the paper says very little.
1760554182	1760554183	Premise: ``You 've heard something like that before. Haven't you, Jimmy?'' Jimmy had been shaken by those sounds more shaken than the others for good reason but Cardiff could see that he was unprepared to show it as he pushed himself away from the reception counter.  Hypothesis: Jimmy was unprepared to show he had been shaken  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that Jimmy had been shaken by the sounds, and that Cardiff could see that Jimmy was unprepared to show it. This implies that Jimmy is trying to hide or conceal his emotional response to the sounds, which is consistent with the hypothesis that Jimmy was unprepared to show that he had been shaken.
1760554183	1760554186	Premise: It was Alan's idea. He made a sour kind of joke out of it, that they must wait until their wedding night. Carolyn agreed because she could see he meant it although she didn't understand why.  Hypothesis: Alan meant it  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that Alan made a joke out of the idea that they must wait until their wedding night, and Carolyn agreed because she understood that he meant it. This implies that Alan did indeed mean it, as Carolyn's understanding of his joke suggests that he was being serious about waiting until their wedding night.  The phrase "he made a joke out of it" is often used to indicate that someone is using humor to convey a message, and in this case, the message is that they should wait until their wedding night. The fact that Carolyn understood that Alan meant it suggests that his joke was not just a joke, but rather a way of expressing a serious intention.
1760554186	1760554189	Premise: And why bother to write anyway? What was there to say? Mary had some vague idea that Adam's parents might suspect he was down here and come to see him.  Hypothesis: Adam was down here  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise states that Mary had some vague idea that Adam's parents might suspect he was down here and come to see him, which implies that there is a possibility that Adam's parents might suspect something. However, it does not state that Adam is actually down here, which is what the hypothesis claims.  In other words, the premise only suggests that Mary has a suspicion or a possibility, but it does not provide evidence or confirmation that the suspicion is true. The hypothesis, on the other hand, makes a definite claim that Adam is down here, which is not necessarily supported by the premise.  To entail the hypothesis, the premise would need to explicitly state that Adam is down here, or provide evidence or strong indication that Adam is indeed down here. As it stands, the premise only sets up a possibility or a suspicion, but does not provide conclusive evidence to support the hypothesis.
1760554189	1760554191	Premise: ``And you're not having this dress,'' Nora said, bending down to look at the price tag. ``It's two and a half guineas!'' she hissed at Louise who could tell that she was genuinely appalled.  Hypothesis: Nora was genuinely appalled  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that Nora "was genuinely appalled", which means that her reaction to the price of the dress is a true reflection of her feelings. The sentence "She could tell that she was genuinely appalled" further reinforces this idea, suggesting that Louise has observed Nora's reaction and can confirm that it is genuine.  The phrase "hissed at Louise" also implies that Nora's reaction is strong and intense, which is consistent with the idea that she is genuinely appalled by the price of the dress. If Nora were not genuinely appalled, she would likely not be reacting with such strong emotions.  Therefore, the premise provides strong evidence to support the hypothesis that Nora was genuinely appalled by the price of the dress.
1760554191	1760554194	Premise: She said good morning to Alice and Alice said hallo. She was thin and rather tall with a very lined gentle face and hair that was white but which Alice could see had once been blonde. She could also have told this was Tina's mother before Mrs Darne went off down the passage that led to the Headmaster's Flat.  Hypothesis: this was Tina's mother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that the woman said good morning to Alice and Alice said hallo, and that the woman was Tina's mother. The hypothesis states that this woman is Tina's mother. The premise provides evidence that the woman is indeed Tina's mother, as it explicitly states that she is.  The premise also describes the woman's physical appearance, which is consistent with the description of Tina's mother in the hypothesis. The description of the woman's face, hair, and height matches the description of Tina's mother in the hypothesis.  Therefore, the premise provides sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that this woman is Tina's mother.
1760554194	1760554195	Premise: She might have sat all afternoon, nibbling and stuporous, exhausted but not sleepy. But the glazier finally came down from the upper floor, cheerfully announcing that all was now right and tight and he would be on his way. Maggie could tell that he would have liked to stop for a chat that he felt sorry for her left on her own but she lacked either her grandmother's grace or her mother's energy so she did not offer him tea.  Hypothesis: the glazier would have liked to stop for a chat  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis. The text states that "he would have liked to stop for a chat that he felt sorry for her left on her own", which explicitly indicates that the glazier has a desire to engage in conversation with Maggie. This desire is a necessary condition for the hypothesis, which states that the glazier would have liked to stop for a chat.
1760554195	1760554197	Premise: Jim waited. He waited a long time, and when the young doctor finally came out, it was almost dark. Jim could nonetheless tell by his anxious face that something was wrong.  Hypothesis: something was wrong  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The sentence "Jim could nonetheless tell by his anxious face that something was wrong" strongly suggests that the doctor's anxious face indicates that something is amiss. The use of the word "anxious" to describe the doctor's face implies that the doctor is worried or concerned about something, which is consistent with the hypothesis that "something was wrong". The fact that Jim is able to infer that something is wrong from the doctor's face also implies that the doctor's expression is a clear indication of a problem, further supporting the hypothesis.
1760554197	1760554199	Premise: ``Yes?'' ``Nathan?'' He could tell it was long-distance the line was so gravelly and hollow but he didn't recognise the voice.  Hypothesis: the call was long-distance  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states "the line was so gravelly and hollow", which is a characteristic often associated with long-distance phone calls. The use of words like "gravelly" and "hollow" to describe the sound of the line suggests that the speaker is not in the same physical location as the person they are speaking to, which is a hallmark of a long-distance call.
1760554199	1760554201	Premise: Chopra stood unsteadily on his feet. The shapechanger bounded around with excitement. Chopra could tell something had happened.  Hypothesis: something had happened  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that Chopra stood unsteadily on his feet, and the shapechanger bounded around with excitement. The fact that Chopra is standing unsteadily and the shapechanger is excited suggests that something unexpected or unusual has happened, which aligns with the hypothesis that "something had happened".  The use of the word "unsteadily" to describe Chopra's stance implies that he is not in his normal state, and the shapechanger's excitement further reinforces the idea that something out of the ordinary has occurred. The connection between Chopra's unsteadiness and the shapechanger's excitement suggests that the two are related, and that the event that has occurred has affected both of them.  Therefore, the premise provides sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that "something had happened".
1760554201	1760554204	Premise: It seemed impossible that anyone could endure such pain for so long, but at last the doors of the Renault slammed and there was comparative silence. The engine was started up, revving violently as the car was turned round on the narrow road. John could tell that it was being driven back up the hill towards Putna.  Hypothesis: the car was being driven back up the hill towards Putna  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that "the doors of the Renault slammed and there was comparative silence" and then describes the engine revving violently as the car is turned around and driven back up the hill towards Putna. The phrase "there was comparative silence" suggests that the car was initially stationary, and the revving of the engine indicates that it was then started and driven away. The direction of the drive is explicitly stated as "back up the hill towards Putna", which matches the hypothesis.  Therefore, the premise provides strong evidence that the car is indeed being driven back up the hill towards Putna, making the hypothesis a logical conclusion.
1760554204	1760554206	Premise: Just when you think you 've got it straight, along comes the Fool with his pig's bladder and whops you on the nose. By the way, I'm no idiot. I could tell Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see me at the airport.  Hypothesis: Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see her at the airport  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	A clever question!  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states "I'm no idiot. I could tell Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see me at the airport." This implies that the speaker is claiming to have observed that Gillian and Stuart were not pleased to see her at the airport, which is exactly what the hypothesis states.  In other words, the premise is providing evidence to support the hypothesis. The speaker is saying, "I'm not an idiot, and even I could see that Gillian and Stuart weren't thrilled to see me, so it's clear that they weren't thrilled."
1760554206	1760554208	Premise: He's weird enough to have undressed me without thinking, according to some mad notion of the ``proper'' thing to do. Perhaps he thought I couldn't lie in bed with my clothes on.  Hypothesis: she couldn't lie in bed with her clothes on  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	A nice logical puzzle!  The premise states that the person undressed her without thinking, according to some mad notion of the "proper" thing to do. The hypothesis claims that she couldn't lie in bed with her clothes on.  The premise does not explicitly state that she couldn't lie in bed with her clothes on. It only mentions that the person undressed her without thinking, which might be due to a misguided notion of what is "proper". The hypothesis is an additional assumption that is not necessarily supported by the premise.  Therefore, I conclude that the premise does not entail the hypothesis.
1760554208	1760554211	Premise: That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort. Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all. But you will perhaps understand that there was a natural tendency on my part in asking what was after all a generous favour from my employer to hint that there was a good professional motive behind my request.  Hypothesis: there was a natural tendency on her part to hint that there was a good professional motive behind her request  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise states that the speaker brought up Miss Kenton in a conversation with Mr. Farraday at a time when he was likely to be in a lighthearted and humorous mood, and that this was a mistake because it would have been wiser not to mention her. The premise does not mention a "natural tendency" to hint at a professional motive, which is what the hypothesis claims.  The speaker's mistake was not to hint at a professional motive, but rather to bring up Miss Kenton at all, given the circumstances. The speaker is acknowledging that they should have been more considerate of Mr. Farraday's mood and avoided mentioning Miss Kenton, rather than trying to justify their request with a professional motive.  In contrast, the hypothesis suggests that the speaker had a tendency to hint at a professional motive, which is not supported by the premise.
1760554211	1760554214	Premise: But don't dilly-dally for too long. Once it's published we are all going to look a little risible if we have made no adjustments to what is after all known as being predominantly my own design of gallery. Also I am a bit older than the rest of you but you can perhaps understand that I don't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation.  Hypothesis: he doesn't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that the speaker wants to make adjustments to the gallery before it's published, and that they don't want to "drop dead" without a proper and public recantation. The phrase "drop dead" is an idiomatic expression that means to die, and the speaker's desire to avoid it suggests that they are concerned about their mortality and want to achieve something significant before they pass away.  The hypothesis that the speaker doesn't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation is a direct consequence of the premise. The speaker's desire to make adjustments to the gallery and avoid dying without achieving their goal implies that they want to have a sense of closure or completion before they pass away, and that they want this to be publicly acknowledged.
1760554214	1760554217	Premise: I should dearly have liked to know whether they were Europeans or Americans, but I couldn't hear the accents. They appeared to be arguing. I hoped the white men weren't telling him to eliminate all witnesses because I don't believe it would have needed much persuasion.  Hypothesis: eliminating all witnesses would have needed much persuasion  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise states that the narrator "don't believe" that it would have needed much persuasion for the white men to eliminate all witnesses, implying that they would likely be easily persuaded to do so. The narrator's disbelief in this matter suggests that they think the white men would not need much convincing to eliminate all witnesses.  The premise does not entail the hypothesis, however. The premise only expresses the narrator's opinion or belief about the likelihood of the white men eliminating all witnesses, whereas the hypothesis is a statement about the actual requirement of persuasion. The premise does not necessarily imply that eliminating all witnesses would require much persuasion; it only suggests that the narrator thinks it would not.  In other words, the premise is about the narrator's epistemic state (their belief or opinion), whereas the hypothesis is a factual statement about the world. The two are related but distinct, and the premise does not logically entail the hypothesis.
1760554217	1760554220	Premise: But the damage was done as far as my faith was concerned, which is probably why I went mad. So anyway, that Christmas Eve night confirmed my worst fears, it was like a kind of ``royal flush'' for the infant Jimbo. All three kings - Pa Santa and the King of Kings - all down the pan together... And to be honest I don't believe any of them stands a chance of ever making a comeback with me.  Hypothesis: any of the three kings stands a chance of ever making a comeback with him  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the speaker's faith was damaged and they went mad, and that the events of Christmas Eve night confirmed their worst fears, implying that they have lost faith in all three kings (Pa Santa, the King of Kings, and possibly other kings). The premise suggests that the speaker's loss of faith is a done deal, and that it's unlikely for any of the kings to regain their trust.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that any of the three kings has a chance of making a comeback with the speaker. This is explicitly contradicted by the premise, which implies that the speaker's faith is lost and that the kings have no chance of regaining it.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the speaker's loss of faith and the events of Christmas Eve night suggest that the kings have no chance of making a comeback with the speaker.
1760554220	1760554224	Premise: He had seen something I should have, which was a car turning in from Soho Square and coming up behind me. My right foot hovered over the accelerator pedal and I balanced Armstrong on the clutch. I wasn't as convinced as Malpass that Nevil was out of harm's way.  Hypothesis: Nevil was out of harm's way  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that the narrator had seen something they should have, which was a car turning in from Soho Square and coming up behind the narrator. This implies that the narrator was aware of the car's presence and was taking action to prepare for it, such as hovering their foot over the accelerator pedal and balancing Armstrong on the clutch. This suggests that the narrator was taking steps to ensure their safety and the safety of others, including Nevil, who is mentioned in the hypothesis.  The fact that the narrator is not as convinced as Malpass that Nevil is out of harm's way implies that there may be some doubt or uncertainty about Nevil's safety. However, the premise suggests that the narrator is taking proactive steps to address this uncertainty, which is consistent with the hypothesis that Nevil is out of harm's way. Overall, the premise provides evidence that supports the hypothesis that Nevil is out of harm's way, as the narrator is taking steps to ensure their safety.
1760554224	1760554226	Premise: Jed wondered. He 'd scarcely set eyes on him since the night they 'd had dinner together at the house in Westwood. Nobody had mentioned him either and Jed didn't feel he should ask.  Hypothesis: Jed should ask  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states that Jed "didn't feel he should ask" about someone, implying that Jed is considering asking about this person but is hesitant to do so. The hypothesis "Jed should ask" follows logically from this setup, as it suggests that Jed's hesitation is unjustified and that asking about the person would be a reasonable and possibly necessary action.  In other words, the premise sets up a situation where Jed is conflicted about whether to ask about someone, and the hypothesis provides a conclusion that Jed should indeed ask.
1760554226	1760554228	Premise: Yet what good came from knowing that a woman had killed herself? The children who had suffered a trauma would survive the experience, scarred by it and a little flawed by it. They would never forget that for a week they had imagined the act of murder had been committed.  Hypothesis: for a week the children had imagined the act of murder had been committed  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that the children "had suffered a trauma" and that "for a week they had imagined the act of murder had been committed." The hypothesis, on the other hand, is that "for a week the children had imagined the act of murder had been committed."  The premise provides evidence that supports the hypothesis by stating that the children had imagined the act of murder, which is a key component of the hypothesis. The premise does not contradict the hypothesis, and the hypothesis is a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the information provided in the premise.
1760554228	1760554231	Premise: Nora calculated that there must be lots of single men up there so she decided it was ideal for the ``manhunt'', as we called it, even though the train fare was a serious consideration. I remember we went up to Euston together one Saturday morning, very excited, to buy the ticket in advance. It was a secret - if my parents had known she was going away alone they would have soon put the kybosh on it.  Hypothesis: Nora was going away alone  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states "Nora calculated that there must be lots of single men up there so she decided it was ideal for the 'manhunt', as we called it, even though the train fare was a serious consideration." This suggests that Nora was planning to go somewhere alone, as she mentions the train fare being a consideration, implying that she was planning to travel by herself. The phrase "as we called it" also implies that Nora was planning to go on this trip with someone else, but the text later reveals that it was a secret, indicating that the "we" referred to is actually just the narrator and Nora. Therefore, the premise provides strong evidence for the hypothesis that Nora was going away alone.
1760554231	1760554232	Premise: His mother driving the car, so happy, young-looking and fashionably dressed and his father, a big, confident man in a smart suit, smiling and turning round to say something to Simon in the back seat. Marie thought of her own mother with her frumpy clothes and ageing, lined face. No one would have guessed that she was only forty-two.  Hypothesis: Marie's mother was only forty-two  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	A nice and subtle one!  Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states: "Marie thought of her own mother with her frumpy clothes and ageing, lined face. No one would have guessed that she was only forty-two."  The phrase "No one would have guessed that she was only forty-two" implies that Marie's mother is actually 42 years old, which is the hypothesis. The premise is describing Marie's thoughts and comparisons, which leads us to conclude that Marie's mother's age is 42.
1760554232	1760554236	Premise: ``I hope you are settling down and the cat is well.'' This was a lie. She did not hope the cat was well.  Hypothesis: the cat was well  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	A nice little logic puzzle!  The premise "I hope you are settling down and the cat is well" is a statement that expresses a wish or a hope. The key phrase is "I hope", which indicates that the speaker is expressing a desire for something to be the case.  The hypothesis "the cat was well" is a statement about the actual state of the cat's health.  Now, let's analyze the entailment:  The premise only expresses a hope or a desire for the cat to be well, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the cat actually is well. The speaker might be lying, as the premise states. In fact, the speaker explicitly states that the premise is a lie, which means that the cat might not be well at all.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise only expresses a hope or a desire, but it doesn't provide any evidence or guarantee that the cat is actually well.
1760554236	1760554238	Premise: Jane ate without pausing. Hunger was an unknown experience. She had never imagined it could actually hurt.  Hypothesis: hunger could actually hurt  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that "Hunger was an unknown experience. She had never imagined it could actually hurt." This implies that Jane had never experienced hunger before, and she didn't know that it could be a painful or uncomfortable sensation. The phrase "had never imagined it could actually hurt" suggests that she had a prior lack of knowledge about the nature of hunger.  The hypothesis "hunger could actually hurt" is a logical conclusion that can be drawn from this premise. The premise sets up the idea that Jane is not aware of the potential discomfort or pain associated with hunger, which is exactly what the hypothesis states. Therefore, the premise provides evidence to support the hypothesis.
1760554238	1760554240	Premise: Miss Martindale had had a school, but her rigid ideas and stern manner had frightened the children, and their parents had taken them away. And gradually the school declined, until she had to give it up and retire to end her days in the white cottage with the inevitable cat as her only companion. Breeze had never imagined that digging was such hard work.  Hypothesis: digging was such hard work  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise describes Miss Martindale's experience with digging, specifically saying "Breeze had never imagined that digging was such hard work." This suggests that Miss Martindale, a person who has experience with digging, has come to realize that digging is indeed a difficult task. The premise presents this realization as a surprise to Breeze, implying that the premise is setting up the expectation that digging is not as hard as it seems, but the reality is that it is indeed hard work.
1760554240	1760554244	Premise: ``You don't need to worry. We're quite adequately chaperoned. Rosa is a woman of strict moral principles.'' If she knows I'm in here she's probably hovering outside the door right now.  Hypothesis: he's in here  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	A nice little logical puzzle!  The premise states that "You don't need to worry. We're quite adequately chaperoned. Rosa is a woman of strict moral principles." This suggests that Rosa is present and watching over the situation, ensuring that everything is proper and moral.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, is that "he's in here", which implies that the speaker is in a private or enclosed space with someone else.  Now, let's analyze the entailment:  If the premise is true, then it is indeed possible that Rosa is hovering outside the door, watching over the situation. But this does not necessarily mean that the speaker is in a private space with someone else. Rosa's presence could be ensuring that the speaker is alone, or that the speaker is with a group of people, not just one person.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise provides information about Rosa's presence and her moral principles, but it does not provide any direct evidence or implication about the speaker's location or company.
1760554244	1760554246	Premise: I said you were mad to come over at this time. It's a world event. Don't you know that Venice is packed with visitors?  Hypothesis: Venice is packed with visitors  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that you said someone was "mad" to come over at this time, implying that it's a bad idea to visit at this time. It also mentions that it's a "world event" and that Venice is "packed with visitors", which suggests that the event is causing a large influx of people to the city. The use of the phrase "packed with visitors" implies that the city is crowded, which supports the hypothesis that Venice is indeed packed with visitors.  The premise provides evidence for the hypothesis by describing the situation in Venice as chaotic and crowded, making it clear that the city is experiencing a surge in visitors due to the world event.
1760554246	1760554248	Premise: And what she had said, and went on saying quietly, calmly, efficiently, was that she loved Maggie. She paid attention. At eight Maggie had not known that her grandmother was famous but she had seen that people had something in their manner when they looked at Rachel.  Hypothesis: Maggie's grandmother was famous  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise only mentions that people had something in their manner when they looked at Rachel, which could be due to many reasons, not necessarily because Rachel is famous. The premise does not provide any direct evidence or information that suggests Rachel is famous.  The hypothesis is an inference that can be drawn from the premise, but it is not a logical conclusion. The premise only hints at the possibility that Rachel might be famous, but it does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis.
1760554248	1760554250	Premise: They 'd seen Miss Lavant on the promenade and about the town, always walking slowly, sometimes with a neat wicker basket. Kate had often thought she was beautiful. She hadn't known she was in love with Dr Greenslade who had a wife already and three children.  Hypothesis: Miss Lavant was in love with Dr Greenslade  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Kate had often thought Miss Lavant was beautiful, and that Miss Lavant was seen walking slowly with a wicker basket. It does not provide any information about Miss Lavant's romantic feelings or relationships. The hypothesis that Miss Lavant was in love with Dr. Greenslade is not supported by the premise.  In fact, the premise provides evidence that contradicts the hypothesis. It mentions that Dr. Greenslade already has a wife and three children, which suggests that he is not available for romantic relationships with Miss Lavant.
1760554250	1760554252	Premise: Did he intend everyone in the castle to know he did not want the wife he had married in such a hurry? Did he intend to ignore her completely? Then Isabel saw Ellen's stunned face and realised that her maid at least did not know she had spent the night alone.  Hypothesis: Isabel had spent the night alone  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise does entail the hypothesis. The premise states that Isabel saw Ellen's stunned face and realized that her maid at least did not know she had spent the night alone. This implies that Isabel had indeed spent the night alone, which is the hypothesis being tested.  The use of the word "realized" suggests that Isabel had previously been unaware of Ellen's lack of knowledge, and that she had only just come to understand the situation. This implies that Isabel had spent the night alone, and that Ellen did not know about it.
1760554252	1760554255	Premise: Most of them young, about his age, stood and talked and drank and laughed. The two girls he had noticed earlier were standing talking to some other girls. Graham hoped they all realised that just because he was standing talking to Slater that didn't mean he was gay too.  Hypothesis: Graham was gay too  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	A clever question!  The premise states that Graham "hoped they all realised that just because he was standing talking to Slater that didn't mean he was gay too." This sentence implies that Graham is worried about being perceived as gay because of his interaction with Slater, which suggests that Graham might have some concern about his own sexual orientation.  While the premise doesn't explicitly state that Graham is gay, it does hint that Graham has a possible secret or worry about his sexual orientation. The fact that he's hoping others don't assume he's gay because of his interaction with Slater suggests that Graham might be hiding something about himself.  Therefore, I would argue that the premise does entail the hypothesis that Graham is gay too, at least to some extent. The premise provides circumstantial evidence that suggests Graham may be struggling with his own sexuality or is concerned about being perceived as gay.
1760554255	1760554257	Premise: He said that maybe I wasn't ready to join the Party just yet. Terry's passion for equality appealed to my purer mind, and his hatred of existing authority appealed to my resentments. But although I hated inequality it didn't mean I wanted to be treated like everyone else.  Hypothesis: he wanted to be treated like everyone else  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that the speaker's hatred of inequality appeals to their resentments, but it also states that they don't want to be treated like everyone else. This suggests that the speaker has a desire to be treated uniquely or differently, not the same as everyone else. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the person wants to be treated like everyone else, which is the opposite of what the premise implies.  The premise is more focused on the speaker's reaction to Terry's passion for equality and their own resentment towards authority, whereas the hypothesis is focused on the person's desire for treatment. The two are not necessarily connected, and the premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis.
1760554257	1760554261	Premise: ``Oh, my poor Folly... We 've been together for five years, Lexy and I - she practically holds that company together. Of course I gave her an ``A''. But that doesn't mean I'm having an affair with her.  Hypothesis: he is having an affair with Lexy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	A nice little puzzle!  After analyzing the premise, I would say that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states that the speaker gave Lexy an "A" and mentions that Lexy practically holds the company together. The speaker also mentions that they've been together for five years, which suggests a long-term relationship. The speaker explicitly denies having an affair with Lexy, saying "But that doesn't mean I'm having an affair with her."  The premise only provides information about the speaker's relationship with Lexy, specifically the fact that they gave her an "A" and the importance of her role in the company. It does not provide any evidence that would suggest an affair. The speaker's denial of the affair is also a strong indication that the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  In other words, the premise does not provide any logical connection to the hypothesis that the speaker is having an affair with Lexy. The speaker's actions and words suggest a professional or platonic relationship, rather than a romantic one.
1760554261	1760554264	Premise: Nevertheless, her heart sank at the thought of spending an evening with him in his present state of mind, and she was tempted to invent a sore throat in order to get out of it. But he had been very helpful over the Puddephat business, she admitted to herself, and his moods were unpredictable - he might be on top of the world by the time he arrived at the cinema. ``I'm still keen if you are '' she said brightly pretending she had not noticed anything was amiss.  Hypothesis: something was amiss  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis that something is amiss.  The premise states that her heart sank at the thought of spending an evening with him in his present state of mind, implying that his current mental state is unfavorable or unpleasant. This suggests that there is something wrong or off about his current mood or behavior, which is exactly what the hypothesis "something was amiss" proposes.  Furthermore, the sentence "he had been very helpful over the Puddephat business" and "his moods were unpredictable" also support the hypothesis, as they hint that his behavior can be erratic and unreliable. The fact that she is considering inventing a sore throat to get out of the evening also suggests that she is worried about his behavior and is trying to avoid him.  Overall, the premise sets the stage for a situation where something is indeed amiss, and the hypothesis is a reasonable conclusion based on the information provided.
1760554264	1760554266	Premise: What must it be like to be imprisoned here, day after day, month after month? I wonder, does he keep them chained and manacled, thought Fenella, or does he use sorcery? And so utterly immersed was she in this strange blue and green land that was not feeling strange any more that she did not even notice that she was weighing sorcery against steel chains and seriously considering the likely outcome.  Hypothesis: Fenella was weighing sorcery against steel chains  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that Fenella is wondering what it must be like to be imprisoned and whether the prison is using sorcery or steel chains. This implies that Fenella is considering the possibility of sorcery being used, which is the same as the hypothesis. The premise sets up the idea that Fenella is considering the two possibilities, and the hypothesis is a direct summary of her thought process.
1760554266	1760554270	Premise: Strasbourg, Vienna, Bucharest, Istanbul, not stopping, not looking back. I saw her tossing newly gauffred curls as the open roadster headed east, away from Ollie... Temporarily I managed to re-erect my jocular facade, but inside I was panicking. He could take her away I thought he could just do that he has such power to hurt me this little furry creature who hasn't even noticed that I 've given up the weed.  Hypothesis: he has given up the weed  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	What a fascinating passage!  Upon analyzing the premise, I would argue that the hypothesis "he has given up the weed" is not necessarily entailed by the premise.  Here's why:  1. The premise focuses on the narrator's emotional state, their inner turmoil, and their thoughts about Ollie and his potential power to hurt them. It doesn't provide direct evidence or clues about Ollie's personal habits or decisions regarding the use of a "weed" (which could be a substance, a habit, or something else entirely). 2. The passage doesn't explicitly state that Ollie has given up the weed. The narrator's thoughts are centered around their own feelings of anxiety and the possibility of Ollie taking someone else away, rather than Ollie's own actions or habits. 3. The mention of "he could take her away" and "he has such power to hurt me" suggests that Ollie has some influence or control over the narrator, but it doesn't necessarily imply that he has given up the weed.  In conclusion, while the premise does provide insight into the narrator's emotional state and their concerns about Ollie, it doesn't provide sufficient evidence to conclude that Ollie has given up the weed. The hypothesis remains an independent claim that is not logically entailed by the premise.
1760554270	1760554275	Premise: It - the tractor, the boys and the bulbs in the earth - knew she had chosen for them and was coming back to them. Of course there was still love, there was healthy, growing love and its name was called Work. She had fallen in love with it so slowly and gently and sweetly that she had never noticed it had happened.  Hypothesis: falling in love had happened  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	What a beautiful and poetic passage!  Upon analyzing the premise, I would argue that the hypothesis is indeed entailed. Here's why:  The premise states that "she had chosen for them and was coming back to them", which implies that she has returned to the tractor, the boys, and the bulbs in the earth after being away. The use of the word "chosen" suggests a sense of selection or preference, which is often a hallmark of romantic love or affection.  Furthermore, the passage describes her love for Work as "healthy, growing love", which implies that it has developed over time and is a positive force in her life. The use of the word "sweetly" to describe how she fell in love with Work also conveys a sense of gentle and tender affection.  Given these hints, it's reasonable to infer that the premise entails the hypothesis that falling in love has occurred. The passage suggests that she has developed a strong emotional connection with Work, which is a classic characteristic of romantic love.  Of course, the passage is intentionally ambiguous and open to interpretation, so I may be reading too much into it. Nonetheless, based on the language and imagery used, I believe the hypothesis is at least partially supported by the premise.
1760554275	1760554278	Premise: After the twelfth dot, two thirds of the way down the page, the transcript of this long session tails away into blank paper. I suppose what's happened is this. He has gone on staring out of the window thinking and she has gone on staring at him waiting with such absorption that neither of them noticed the tape had run out.  Hypothesis: the tape had run out  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise states that "the transcript of this long session tails away into blank paper" after the twelfth dot, implying that the recording or writing stopped abruptly at that point. The hypothesis that the tape had run out suggests that the reason for the abrupt stop is that the tape or recording medium had reached its end.  The premise entails the hypothesis because it provides a possible explanation for the sudden disappearance of the transcript. The phrase "tails away into blank paper" implies a sudden and inexplicable cutoff, which is exactly what would happen if the tape had run out. The fact that the transcript does not continue beyond the twelfth dot suggests that there was no further recording or writing taking place, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the tape had reached its end.  In other words, the premise provides a clear and plausible explanation for the observed phenomenon (the abrupt cutoff of the transcript), and the hypothesis that the tape had run out is a reasonable and coherent explanation for that phenomenon.
1760554278	1760554279	Premise: ``His name is Matthew Blake,'' Mandy informed Charity as they descended the steps from their cabin on to the paved pathway that led to the lodge. Thankfully she hadn't even noticed that Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt and was now wearing red shorts with her white silk blouse.  Hypothesis: Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states "Thankfully she hadn't even noticed that Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt and was now wearing red shorts with her white silk blouse." This sentence explicitly mentions that Charity had changed from the blue wrap-around skirt, which is the same information stated in the hypothesis.
1760554279	1760554281	Premise: ``These ` ere smugglers is a dangerous bunch from wot I 've ` eard!'' ``If only we could devise a safe way of laying our hands on all that money,'' murmured Pugwash, whose greed was as proverbial as his cowardice. And the pirates were so busy discussing the problem and what they would do with the reward if they won it that they didn't notice that they were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage.  Hypothesis: the pirates were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states: "the pirates were so busy discussing the problem and what they would do with the reward if they won it that they didn't notice that they were being observed from the window above by none other than the new Mayor and his entourage."  This sentence explicitly states that the pirates were being observed from the window above by the new Mayor and his entourage, which is the exact hypothesis being tested. Therefore, the premise provides direct evidence for the hypothesis, making it a entailment.
1760554281	1760554282	Premise: Ockleton, Morpurgo, Cornelius, Dysart and half a dozen others too drunk to mention. But there was so much coming and going that any one of us could have slipped out, pushed Everett through the window and slipped back again without being noticed. Damn it all we didn't even notice Everett was missing until a porter tripped over him in the quad so anything's theoretically possible.  Hypothesis: Everett was missing  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis that Everett was missing. The premise states that "we didn't even notice Everett was missing until a porter tripped over him in the quad", which implies that Everett was not present or accounted for until the porter found him, suggesting that he was indeed missing. The premise sets up the context for the hypothesis that Everett was missing, which is later explicitly stated.
1760554282	1760554285	Premise: His hair was white, as my daughters reported when they went to view the body before it was given to the Odonata. Now he is known as The Man Who Changed the World, and there are statues to him everywhere. No one remembers he had a younger brother.  Hypothesis: The Man Who Changed the World had a younger brother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	A clever question!  The premise states: "No one remembers he had a younger brother."  This sentence implies that there is a possibility that the Man Who Changed the World did have a younger brother, but nobody remembers it. In other words, the lack of memory about a younger brother is not equivalent to the absence of a younger brother.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The hypothesis is actually the negation of the premise, as it asserts that there was a younger brother, which is not remembered.  In other words, the premise only says that people don't remember the existence of a younger brother, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that such a brother existed.
1760554285	1760554287	Premise: Oh, I did, I did! I was lucky. I would have liked brothers and sisters but I don't remember that I was ever lonely.  Hypothesis: she was ever lonely  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise states that the speaker "would have liked brothers and sisters" but "don't remember that I was ever lonely." This suggests that the speaker did not experience loneliness, despite not having siblings.  The hypothesis states that she was ever lonely. The premise does not entail this hypothesis, as it explicitly states that the speaker does not remember being lonely. The premise provides evidence against the hypothesis, suggesting that the speaker did not experience loneliness.  In other words, the premise contradicts the hypothesis, and it is unlikely that the hypothesis is true given the information provided in the premise.
1760554287	1760554290	Premise: Her priggishness. I admire it. I know she does wrong things she tries to organize other people's lives she can't see Mr Knightley is a man in a million.  Hypothesis: Mr Knightley is a man in a million  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise states that the speaker admires Emma's priggishness and recognizes that she does wrong things, but tries to organize other people's lives. It also mentions that she can't see that Mr. Knightley is a man in a million.  The premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise only talks about Emma's character and her relationship with Mr. Knightley, but it does not provide any evidence or justification for why Mr. Knightley is a man in a million. The hypothesis is an independent statement that requires additional information or evidence to be supported.  In fact, the premise could be interpreted as suggesting that Mr. Knightley is not necessarily a man in a million, as Emma is unable to see his qualities. The speaker's admiration for Emma's priggishness and her recognition of her flaws does not necessarily imply that Mr. Knightley is exceptional in any way.
1760554290	1760554293	Premise: Only she herself knew the evil thoughts she had and how effortlessly they could be translated into action. ``I 'll make a cup of tea.'' No she would not tell Peter that the person he loved most in the world was dead.  Hypothesis: the person Peter loved most in the world was dead  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that only she herself knew the evil thoughts she had and how effortlessly they could be translated into action, and then mentions that she would not tell Peter that the person he loved most in the world was dead. This implies that the person Peter loved most in the world is indeed dead, and she is hiding this information from him.  The fact that she is not telling Peter something, and that she has evil thoughts that could be translated into action, suggests that she is motivated to keep the truth from him, which in turn implies that the truth is something Peter would not want to hear. The only thing that makes sense in this context is that the person Peter loves most in the world is dead.  The premise provides strong evidence for the hypothesis, and it is difficult to imagine any alternative explanation that would fit the context and the information provided.
1760554293	1760554295	Premise: ``It's not your day, is it, dear?'' ``No, but they 've got to be done, and Shirley's making the tea.'' Ianthe had not told her mother that she sometimes had to dust the books in the library.  Hypothesis: Ianthe sometimes had to dust the books in the library  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise states: "It's not your day, is it, dear?'' ``No, but they've got to be done, and Shirley's making the tea.'' ``Ianthe had not told her mother that she sometimes had to dust the books in the library."  The premise does not entail the hypothesis that Ianthe sometimes had to dust the books in the library. The premise only mentions Ianthe's mother not knowing about Ianthe's task, and Shirley making tea, but it does not provide any information about Ianthe's actual duties.  The hypothesis is not a logical consequence of the premise, and it is not necessarily true based on the information provided.
1760554295	1760554297	Premise: He pulled occasionally, his arms tiring. Conker slowed a little, but the branches were coming too fast, he had to lean right forward and couldn't use his hands. He remembered the gate at the end of the track had time to hope it was open because he didn't think Conker could jump it.  Hypothesis: Conker could jump the gate  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that Conker is pulling, but his arms are tiring, and he's slowing down. It also mentions that the gate at the end of the track is coming up, and Conker can't use his hands to open it. This implies that Conker is not able to open the gate in any other way, and therefore, he must rely on his ability to jump it. The fact that Conker has time to hope the gate is open suggests that he thinks it might be possible for him to jump it, which is exactly what the hypothesis states.
1760554297	1760554300	Premise: But he ended up eating it himself. I was reluctant to kiss my mother, afraid that somehow her weakness and unhappiness would infect me. Naturally I didn't think for a minute that my life and spirit could stimulate her.  Hypothesis: her life and spirit could stimulate her mother  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise and hypothesis are related but do not entail each other.  The premise states that the narrator was reluctant to kiss his mother because he was afraid of being infected by her weakness and unhappiness. This suggests that the narrator believes that his mother's negative emotions could have a negative impact on him.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the narrator's life and spirit could have a positive impact on his mother, stimulating her and possibly improving her well-being.  The premise and hypothesis are not mutually exclusive, but they do not logically entail each other. The premise focuses on the narrator's fear of being negatively affected by his mother, while the hypothesis suggests that the narrator could have a positive influence on his mother.
1760554300	1760554302	Premise: ``Ely,'' I said (that was her name and the first time I 'd ever used it), ``I want to be free.'' She looked stunned. I don't think she 'd considered this.  Hypothesis: Ely had considered him wanting to be free  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	No, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.  The premise states that Ely looked "stunned", implying that she was surprised or taken aback by the speaker's statement. This suggests that Ely had not anticipated the speaker's desire to be free, which is the opposite of considering it.  In other words, the premise implies that Ely was not prepared for the speaker's request, which implies that she had not considered it, not that she had considered it but was simply surprised by the speaker's decision to express it.
1760554302	1760554305	Premise: I'm sorry, I 've put you in an invidious position. If you're being run by Morton, he 'll want to hear all this. It won't do any harm but I 'd rather not give him food for thought because I consider him an idiot and I don't think he's capable of interpreting it correctly.  Hypothesis: Morton is capable of interpreting this food for thought correctly  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	A delightful philosophical puzzle!  Let's break it down:  The premise states that the speaker is sorry for putting the listener in an invidious position, which means the speaker thinks the listener will be in a difficult or unpleasant situation if the listener shares the information with Morton. The speaker also thinks that if Morton hears this information, he will interpret it incorrectly.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Morton is capable of interpreting the information correctly.  Now, let's analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis:  If the premise is true, it means that the speaker believes Morton will misinterpret the information. However, the hypothesis states that Morton is capable of interpreting the information correctly. These two statements seem to contradict each other.  Therefore, I conclude that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise assumes that Morton will misinterpret the information, while the hypothesis assumes that Morton can interpret it correctly. These two assumptions cannot both be true at the same time.  In other words, the speaker's concern that Morton will misinterpret the information is incompatible with the idea that Morton is capable of interpreting it correctly.
1760554305	1760554309	Premise: The big Norwegian shook his head, frowning. ``Jeg fonstAr ikke.'' I don't think he found Ward's accent at all easy and anyway like many foreigners he found it easier to speak English than to understand it.  Hypothesis: the big Norwegian found Ward's accent at all easy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	A nice logical puzzle!  The premise states: "The big Norwegian shook his head, frowning. ``Jeg fonstAr ikke.'' I don't think he found Ward's accent at all easy and anyway like many foreigners he found it easier to speak English than to understand it."  The premise does not entail the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise mentions that the Norwegian "I don't think he found Ward's accent at all easy", which suggests that the Norwegian did not find the accent easy. However, this is not the same as saying that he found it difficult. The hypothesis states that he found it difficult, whereas the premise only implies that it was not easy.  The premise also mentions that the Norwegian found it easier to speak English than to understand it, which is a separate point from the difficulty of understanding Ward's accent. This additional information does not necessarily imply that the accent was difficult for the Norwegian to understand.  In conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as it only provides a negative statement about the ease of understanding the accent, whereas the hypothesis requires a positive statement about the difficulty of understanding the accent.
1760554309	1760554314	Premise: You really don't know anything about me, do you, despite all that wallowing in my mind? As it happens I don't think I'm the right person to lead humanity into the future no.  Hypothesis: she is the right person to lead humanity into the future  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	A delightful philosophical conundrum!  At first glance, it seems that the premise and hypothesis are contradictory. The premise states that the speaker doesn't think they are the right person to lead humanity into the future, while the hypothesis asserts that they are indeed the right person for the job.  However, upon closer examination, I'd argue that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise only expresses the speaker's subjective opinion or self-doubt about their own capabilities, whereas the hypothesis is a objective claim about their actual suitability to lead humanity.  In other words, the speaker's self-doubt does not logically imply that they are actually the right person to lead humanity. The two statements are independent and do not necessarily contradict each other. It's possible for someone to doubt their own abilities while still being objectively well-suited to lead humanity.  For example, someone might doubt their leadership skills due to self-perceived shortcomings, but still possess the necessary qualities, experience, and abilities to excel in the role. In this case, the premise and hypothesis would be compatible, as the speaker's self-doubt would be misplaced.  In conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the speaker's self-doubt is a subjective opinion that does not necessarily reflect their objective suitability to lead humanity.
1760554314	1760554317	Premise: It's where the bands practise. I can't remember what band Petra's in, but I seen them practise once. They were OK but I didn't think they was brilliant.  Hypothesis: Petra's band was brilliant  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	A delightful exercise in logical analysis!  The premise states: "It's where the bands practise. I can't remember what band Petra's in, but I seen them practise once. They were OK but I didn't think they was brilliant."  The hypothesis states: "Petra's band was brilliant".  Now, let's analyze the premise:  1. The premise mentions that Petra's band practises at a certain location, but it doesn't provide any information about the quality of their music. 2. The premise also mentions that the speaker saw Petra's band practise once and thought they were "OK", which implies that the speaker didn't think they were particularly good or outstanding. 3. The speaker explicitly states that they didn't think Petra's band was "brilliant", which is the opposite of the hypothesis.  Given these points, I conclude that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise provides no evidence or support for the hypothesis that Petra's band is brilliant, and in fact, it suggests the opposite.
1760554317	1760554321	Premise: She swallowed hard, unsure if she had the nerve to go ahead. The memory of the pain in Tara's eyes last night decided her. Did he really expect her to believe that Tara was only the housekeeper?  Hypothesis: Tara was only the housekeeper  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise suggests that the speaker is unsure if she has the nerve to go ahead with something, and the memory of the pain in Tara's eyes last night is what decides her. This implies that the speaker has doubts about something related to Tara, which is not necessarily related to Tara being only the housekeeper.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Tara is only the housekeeper. There is no indication in the premise that this is the case. In fact, the speaker's doubts and the reference to "the pain in Tara's eyes" suggest that there may be more to the situation than just Tara being a housekeeper.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The speaker's thoughts and actions are driven by their own uncertainty and the emotional impact of Tara's pain, rather than any assumption about Tara's role as a housekeeper.
1760554321	1760554324	Premise: If there are spirits at work at the time, they come only from yourself, not from the fume of the incense. Why should spirits aid living beings? What arrogance is it that drives people to believe they can have power over them?  Hypothesis: people can have power over spirits  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise states that if there are spirits at work, they come only from oneself, not from the fume of the incense. This implies that the existence of spirits is not dependent on external factors, such as the incense, but rather is a product of one's own being.  The premise does not entail the hypothesis that people can have power over spirits. The premise only addresses the origin of spirits, whereas the hypothesis addresses the relationship between humans and spirits. The premise does not provide any information about whether humans can control or have power over spirits.  In fact, the premise could be seen as implying the opposite, that the spirits are a product of one's own being and therefore may not be susceptible to external control or manipulation. The phrase "arrogance is it that drives people to believe they can have power over them" suggests that the idea of having power over spirits is a hubristic notion, implying that the premise does not support the idea that humans can have power over spirits.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.
1760554324	1760554329	Premise: Why should this topic matter? You talked about everything else as you usually do. Why should I feel Maelmuire is important?  Hypothesis: Maelmuire is important  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	A philosophical inquiry!  The premise "Why should this topic matter?" is a rhetorical question that challenges the importance of the topic. It's asking for a justification or justification for why Maelmuire should be considered significant.  The hypothesis "Maelmuire is important" is a declarative statement that asserts the significance of Maelmuire. In this case, the premise and hypothesis are related, but not directly equivalent.  The premise is a question that seeks to understand the relevance or significance of Maelmuire, whereas the hypothesis is a statement that claims Maelmuire has importance. The premise is asking for a justification, while the hypothesis is providing a claim.  To answer the premise, we need to provide reasons or evidence that demonstrate why Maelmuire is important. In other words, we need to justify the hypothesis. This could involve discussing the historical context, cultural significance, or personal relevance of Maelmuire.  For example, if Maelmuire is a historical figure, we might argue that understanding their life and contributions is important for understanding the context of a particular era or movement. If Maelmuire is a concept or idea, we might argue that it has significant implications for our understanding of a particular field or discipline.  In summary, the premise and hypothesis are related but distinct. The premise asks for justification, while the hypothesis makes a claim. To answer the premise, we need to provide evidence or reasons that support the hypothesis, demonstrating why Maelmuire is indeed important.
1760554329	1760554334	Premise: It is all very well, in these changing times, to adapt one's work to take in duties not traditionally within one's realm. But bantering is of another dimension altogether. For one thing how would one know for sure that at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected?  Hypothesis: at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise states that "it is all very well, in these changing times, to adapt one's work to take in duties not traditionally within one's realm. But bantering is of another dimension altogether." The premise seems to be expressing a nuanced view on the importance of adaptability and the limitations of one's traditional role. It implies that while it's okay to take on new responsibilities, there are some things that are fundamentally different and may not be easily adaptable.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that "at any given moment a response of the bantering sort is truly what is expected." This hypothesis is making a claim about the likelihood of a specific type of response being expected in a given situation.  In my opinion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise is more focused on the idea that there are certain aspects of work that are not easily adaptable, while the hypothesis is making a specific claim about the nature of bantering. The premise does not provide any evidence or justification for the hypothesis, and it does not logically follow from the premise.  In fact, the premise could be interpreted as suggesting that bantering is one of those things that may not be easily adaptable, which would contradict the hypothesis. Therefore, I would conclude that the premise does not entail the hypothesis.
1760554334	1760554337	Premise: But the horror of losing was as much to do with money as with pride. Biddy had never let them down, come without fail all through the bad weather, and now was giving Nails an intensive course on her own horse which - in terms of money - was worth another couple of hundred pounds. Yet surely she knew they had no way of paying should she demand it?  Hypothesis: they had no way of paying  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that "Biddy had never let them down, come without fail all through the bad weather, and now was giving Nails an intensive course on her own horse which - in terms of money - was worth another couple of hundred pounds." This implies that Biddy is providing a valuable service to Nails, which is worth a significant amount of money. However, the premise also states that "they had no way of paying" for this service. This implies that the hypothesis "they had no way of paying" is true, as the value of the service is not being compensated in any way.  The use of the phrase "in terms of money - was worth another couple of hundred pounds" further reinforces this idea, as it explicitly states that the value of Biddy's service is financial. The fact that Nails is receiving this valuable service without paying for it suggests that they are unable to pay, which supports the hypothesis.
1760554337	1760554341	Premise: I ducked so fast I wasn't sure whether he 'd seen me or not, but it gave me a prickly feeling just to imagine it, so I scuttled for the door and legged it up the spiral stairway three steps at a time, just in case. As I ran, I remember thinking stupid thoughts like. How did he know I was up here looking down?  Hypothesis: he was up there looking down  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	What a delightful passage!  Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states that the narrator "ducked so fast I wasn't sure whether he'd seen me or not". This implies that the narrator was in a position where they could have been seen by someone, and they took evasive action (ducking) to avoid being seen. The fact that they're unsure whether they were seen or not suggests that there was a possibility that the person they were trying to avoid might have seen them.  The hypothesis, "he was up there looking down", is consistent with this premise. If someone was looking down from above, it would be possible for them to have seen the narrator and prompted the narrator's evasive action.  The narrator's subsequent thoughts, such as "How did he know I was up here looking down?", also support this interpretation. If the narrator wasn't seen, they wouldn't be wondering how someone knew they were looking down.  So, the premise and hypothesis are indeed connected, and the narrator's actions and thoughts suggest that the hypothesis is a plausible explanation for what happened.
1760554341	1760554346	Premise: At the heart of the universe there is cruelty. We are predators and are preyed upon, every living thing. Did you know that wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds piercing the weak spot in their armour?  Hypothesis: wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	A fascinating and unsettling premise!  The premise states that "at the heart of the universe there is cruelty. We are predators and are preyed upon, every living thing." This suggests that the natural world is characterized by predation and predation is a fundamental aspect of existence.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, specifically claims that wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds, piercing the weak spot in their armor.  Now, the question is whether the premise entails the hypothesis.  I would argue that the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. The premise provides a general statement about the nature of the universe, highlighting the ubiquity of predation. While it may suggest that predators exist and prey is vulnerable, it does not specifically mention wasps, ladybirds, or the behavior of laying eggs in a particular location.  In other words, the premise is more about the general concept of predation and its role in the universe, whereas the hypothesis is a specific claim about the behavior of a particular species (wasps) and their interaction with another species (ladybirds). The premise provides a broader context, but it does not logically follow that wasps must lay their eggs in ladybirds.  To make the premise entail the hypothesis, additional information would be needed to connect the general concept of predation to the specific behavior of wasps and ladybirds. For example, a premise like "In the natural world, predators often target vulnerable spots in their prey's armor to lay their eggs" would be more likely to entail the hypothesis.
1760554346	1760554349	Premise: ``I wanted to tell you. But the Bookman asked me to keep our meeting a secret.'' How did you know I 'd met him?  Hypothesis: he had met the Bookman  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that the speaker wanted to tell something, but the Bookman asked them to keep their meeting a secret. This implies that the speaker has met the Bookman, as they are referring to the Bookman as someone they have interacted with.  The hypothesis that the speaker had met the Bookman is a necessary condition for the premise to make sense. If the speaker had not met the Bookman, it would not be possible for the Bookman to have asked them to keep their meeting a secret. Therefore, the premise logically implies that the speaker had indeed met the Bookman.
1760554349	1760554352	Premise: She rubbed them away with an angry fist. She was a fool to let anyone get round her. How long before she learned that folk 'll always take advantage of weakness?  Hypothesis: folk 'll always take advantage of weakness  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.  The premise states that she was a fool to let anyone get round her, implying that she let someone take advantage of her weakness. The phrase "get round her" means to manipulate or take advantage of someone, and the context suggests that she was vulnerable or weak in some way. The premise is setting up a scenario where she is being taken advantage of because of her weakness.  The hypothesis "folk 'll always take advantage of weakness" is a general statement that can be applied to this specific scenario. The premise is providing an example of how this hypothesis plays out in real life, specifically in the context of this character's situation. The premise is supporting the hypothesis by showing that it is indeed true in this particular case.  In other words, the premise is providing evidence for the hypothesis, suggesting that it is a general truth that folk will always take advantage of weakness, and this character's experience is just one example of this phenomenon.
1760554352	1760554356	Premise: At length she decided that there was nothing to be gained by worrying her. Probably there was some quite innocent explanation, which Roger Kenyon would give her when she returned the wallet - if, indeed, it were his. And yet why had his manner changed so abruptly when he learned that the girl whose hat he had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage?  Hypothesis: the girl whose hat Roger Kenyon had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that "she decided that there was nothing to be gained by worrying her. Probably there was some quite innocent explanation, which Roger Kenyon would give her when she returned the wallet - if, indeed, it were his." This implies that the person is worried about something, specifically the wallet, and is trying to convince themselves that there is a innocent explanation. The hypothesis that the girl whose hat Roger Kenyon had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage is supported by the phrase "and yet why had his manner changed so abruptly when he learned that the girl whose hat he had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage?" This sentence suggests that the person is wondering why Roger Kenyon's behavior changed when he learned that the girl he rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage, implying that there is some connection between the girl, Roger Kenyon, and Sunset Cottage. Therefore, the premise sets up the possibility that the girl whose hat Roger Kenyon rescued is the one who is going to live at Sunset Cottage, making the hypothesis entailed by the premise.
1760554356	1760554358	Premise: Anna looked at Peter again and said to herself in a guilty whisper, ``Will he become even more difficult?'' She wondered if a stranger could tell that he was difficult, just by looking at him. Would such a person watching Peter now reading the prayers of Rite B in his level pleasant voice notice that resentment lay like his blood just under his skin because the life he had chosen had not turned out as he had expected it to?  Hypothesis: resentment lay just under Peter's skin  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis. The premise states that Anna thinks to herself, "Will he become even more difficult?" and then wonders if a stranger could tell that he is difficult by looking at him. This implies that Anna already believes that Peter is difficult, and that she is concerned about whether this difficulty will increase in the future. The premise also describes Peter as having "resentment...just under his skin", which suggests that he is currently harboring feelings of resentment. Therefore, the premise provides evidence that supports the hypothesis that resentment lies just under Peter's skin.
1760554358	1760554361	Premise: Jean was tough and liked to drink. She would endure for a long while yet. But what would she do when she realized that with things as they were she was on a life sentence not just a temporary suspension of essential pleasure?  Hypothesis: Jean was on a life sentence  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states that Jean was tough and liked to drink, implying that she was able to cope with the difficulties of her life. It also says that she would "endure for a long while yet", suggesting that she would be able to sustain herself for a significant period of time. However, the premise also mentions that she would realize that she was "on a life sentence not just a temporary suspension of essential pleasure". This implies that Jean's situation is not just temporary, but rather a permanent state of being.  Given this, it is likely that the "life sentence" refers to a situation that Jean is trapped in, and that she is aware of it. This could be a metaphorical prison, a situation that she feels is unchangeable and permanent. The hypothesis that Jean is on a life sentence is therefore implicit in the premise, as it suggests that she is aware of and is struggling with a long-term, inescapable situation.
1760554361	1760554363	Premise: ``Clever''. Klug means ``clever''. Would you say that Abie was clever?  Hypothesis: Abie was clever  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	The premise states that "Klug" means "clever". It does not provide any information about Abie. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis that Abie was clever.  In other words, just because "Klug" means "clever" does not necessarily mean that Abie is clever. There may be other factors at play, or the premise may not provide enough information to make a conclusion about Abie's cleverness.
1760554363	1760554365	Premise: The Susweca. It means ``dragonfly'' in Sioux, you know. Did I ever tell you that's where Paul and I met?  Hypothesis: Susweca is where she and Paul met  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	A delightful premise!  The premise states: "The Susweca. It means 'dragonfly' in Sioux, you know. Did I ever tell you that's where Paul and I met?"  The premise only mentions that Susweca is a word that means "dragonfly" in Sioux, and that the speaker is wondering if they ever told someone (the person they're speaking to) that it's where they met Paul. The premise does not explicitly state that Susweca is where they met Paul.  Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The hypothesis requires an explicit statement or implication that Susweca is where the speaker and Paul met, which is not present in the premise.
1760554365	1760554369	Premise: How do you know? she was going to ask, but his smile was answer enough. If DeVore said there was going to be a vacancy there would be a vacancy.  Hypothesis: there was going to be a vacancy  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	What a clever and intriguing premise!  Upon analyzing the premise, I would argue that it does entail the hypothesis. Here's why:  The premise states, "If DeVore said there was going to be a vacancy, there would be a vacancy." This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is "DeVore said there was going to be a vacancy" and the consequent is "there would be a vacancy." The phrase "If...then" implies a causal relationship between the two clauses.  The hypothesis "there was going to be a vacancy" is essentially a statement about the future, and the premise is saying that DeVore's statement (about the vacancy) is a reliable indicator of the future event. In other words, if DeVore says there will be a vacancy, it means that a vacancy is indeed going to occur.  Given this interpretation, the premise is essentially stating that the hypothesis is true, as it provides a justification for the hypothesis based on DeVore's reliable statement. Therefore, I conclude that the premise entails the hypothesis.
1760554369	1760554373	Premise: She didn't know if they had given themselves sufficient time to think things over before they married - that was the kind of question her sister Louise asked. Edward stayed in the Engineers for a bit, then came out and was not very successful in finding a job to suit him. That wasn't his fault and if anyone said that it was Nenna would still feel like poking a hole in them.  Hypothesis: it was Edward's fault  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Explain your choice.	A delightful example of a subtle case!  At first glance, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise only mentions that Edward wasn't very successful in finding a job after leaving the Engineers, and Nenna's defensive reaction when someone attributes this to his own fault. This doesn't necessarily imply that Nenna thinks it is Edward's fault. In fact, her reaction suggests that she might be inclined to disagree with anyone who blames Edward.  However, upon closer reading, we can infer that Nenna might have a bias towards not blaming Edward. Her phrase "if anyone said that it was" implies that she is anticipating someone else might blame Edward, and her defensive reaction is a response to that hypothetical criticism. This subtle inference suggests that Nenna might be inclined to downplay or deny any responsibility on Edward's part, which could be interpreted as her implicitly defending him.  So, while the premise does not directly entail the hypothesis, it does provide a hint that Nenna might be inclined to exonerate Edward from any blame, which is a subtle indication that she might not think it's entirely his fault.
