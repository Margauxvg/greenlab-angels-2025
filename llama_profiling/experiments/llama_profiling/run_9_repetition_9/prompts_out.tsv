1760590962	1760590966	Premise: No Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq Yet.  Hypothesis: Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"A classic example of a logical fallacy!  No, the hypothesis ""Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq"" does not follow from the premise ""No Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq... yet"".  The premise only states that no Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) have been found, which is a negative statement about the current state of affairs. It does not provide any information about whether WMDs exist or not. It simply means that no evidence of their existence has been discovered so far.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, makes a positive claim that WMDs have been found. The two statements are mutually exclusive, and the absence of evidence does not provide evidence of existence.  In other words, the premise only tells us that the search has been unsuccessful so far, but it does not rule out the possibility that WMDs might still be present or that they will be found in the future. The hypothesis requires additional evidence to support its claim, which is not provided by the premise."	207
1760590966	1760590968	Premise: A place of sorrow, after Pope John Paul II died, became a place of celebration, as Roman Catholic faithful gathered in downtown Chicago to mark the installation of new Pope Benedict XVI.  Hypothesis: Pope Benedict XVI is the new leader of the Roman Catholic Church.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that after Pope John Paul II died, a place of sorrow became a place of celebration in downtown Chicago to mark the installation of a new Pope. This implies that a new Pope has been chosen and installed, and the celebration is taking place to mark this occasion.  The hypothesis states that Pope Benedict XVI is the new leader of the Roman Catholic Church. This is consistent with the premise, as the premise describes the installation of a new Pope, and Pope Benedict XVI was indeed the Pope who was installed after the death of Pope John Paul II.  Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise.	133
1760590968	1760590970	Premise: Herceptin was already approved to treat the sickest breast cancer patients, and the company said, Monday, it will discuss with federal regulators the possibility of prescribing the drug for more breast cancer patients.  Hypothesis: Herceptin can be used to treat breast cancer.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Herceptin was already approved to treat the sickest breast cancer patients, which implies that Herceptin has been proven to be effective in treating breast cancer. The hypothesis that Herceptin can be used to treat breast cancer is a direct consequence of this information, as it is already known to be effective in treating a certain population (the sickest breast cancer patients).  The additional information that the company will discuss with federal regulators the possibility of prescribing the drug for more breast cancer patients further supports the hypothesis, as it suggests that the company believes Herceptin can be used to treat a broader range of breast cancer patients, not just the sickest ones.	147
1760590970	1760590972	Premise: Judie Vivian, chief executive at ProMedica, a medical service company that helps sustain the 2-year-old Vietnam Heart Institute in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), said that so far about 1,500 children have received treatment.  Hypothesis: The previous name of Ho Chi Minh City was Saigon.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states: ""Premise: Judie Vivian, chief executive at ProMedica, a medical service company that helps sustain the 2-year-old Vietnam Heart Institute in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), said that so far about 1,500 children have received treatment.""  The key phrase is ""formerly Saigon"", which indicates that Ho Chi Minh City was previously known as Saigon. The hypothesis ""The previous name of Ho Chi Minh City was Saigon"" is a direct conclusion that can be drawn from this phrase."	121
1760590972	1760590976	Premise: A man is due in court later charged with the murder 26 years ago of a teenager whose case was the first to be featured on BBC One's Crimewatch. Colette Aram, 16, was walking to her boyfriend's house in Keyworth, Nottinghamshire, on 30 October 1983 when she disappeared. Her body was later found in a field close to her home. Paul Stewart Hutchinson, 50, has been charged with murder and is due before Nottingham magistrates later.  Hypothesis: Paul Stewart Hutchinson is accused of having stabbed a girl.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Paul Stewart Hutchinson is due in court charged with the murder of Colette Aram, a 16-year-old girl who was found dead in a field. The hypothesis states that Paul Stewart Hutchinson is accused of having stabbed a girl. The fact that the victim was a 16-year-old girl and the method of murder is not specified in the premise, but the use of the word ""stabbed"" in the hypothesis is a common method of murder, it is reasonable to infer that the girl was stabbed.  Additionally, the fact that the case was featured on BBC One's Crimewatch 26 years ago suggests that the investigation was thorough and the police had some evidence that linked Paul Stewart Hutchinson to the crime. The fact that he is being charged with murder 26 years later also suggests that the evidence was strong enough to lead to an arrest and a charge.  Overall, while the hypothesis does not provide all the details of the crime, it is consistent with the information provided in the premise and can be reasonably inferred from the facts presented."	225
1760590976	1760590978	Premise: Britain said, Friday, that it has barred cleric, Omar Bakri, from returning to the country from Lebanon, where he was released by police after being detained for 24 hours.  Hypothesis: Bakri was briefly detained, but was released.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Britain has barred Omar Bakri from returning to the country from Lebanon, where he was released by police after being detained for 24 hours. The hypothesis ""Bakri was briefly detained, but was released"" is supported by the premise because it is mentioned that Bakri was detained for 24 hours and then released by police. This sequence of events is consistent with the hypothesis."	91
1760590978	1760590981	Premise: Nearly 4 million children who have at least one parent who entered the U.S. illegally were born in the United States and are U.S. citizens as a result, according to the study conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center. That's about three quarters of the estimated 5.5 million children of illegal immigrants inside the United States, according to the study. About 1.8 million children of undocumented immigrants live in poverty, the study found.  Hypothesis: Three quarters of U.S. illegal immigrants have children.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"The hypothesis ""Three quarters of U.S. illegal immigrants have children"" does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that ""nearly 4 million children who have at least one parent who entered the U.S. illegally were born in the United States and are U.S. citizens as a result"". This implies that these 4 million children have at least one parent who is an illegal immigrant, but it does not imply that three quarters of all U.S. illegal immigrants have children.  In fact, the premise only talks about the number of children who have at least one parent who is an illegal immigrant, not the number of illegal immigrants who have children. It's possible that some illegal immigrants do not have children, and it's also possible that some illegal immigrants have more than one child.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise."	175
1760590981	1760590983	Premise: Like the United States, U.N. officials are also dismayed that Aristide killed a conference called by Prime Minister Robert Malval in Port-au-Prince in hopes of bringing all the feuding parties together.  Hypothesis: Aristide had Prime Minister Robert Malval  murdered in Port-au-Prince.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Aristide killed a conference called by Prime Minister Robert Malval, implying that Aristide was responsible for the death of Prime Minister Malval. The phrase ""killed a conference"" is a metaphorical expression that means Aristide caused the death of the conference, which is equivalent to saying that Aristide was responsible for the death of Prime Minister Malval, who was the one who called the conference.  Therefore, the hypothesis ""Aristide had Prime Minister Robert Malval murdered in Port-au-Prince"" logically follows from the premise, as it is a direct consequence of the events described in the premise."	137
1760590983	1760590986	Premise: WASHINGTON --  A newly declassified narrative of the Bush administration's advice to the CIA on harsh interrogations shows that the small group of Justice Department lawyers who wrote memos authorizing controversial interrogation techniques were operating not on their own but with direction from top administration officials, including then-Vice President Dick Cheney and national security adviser Condoleezza Rice. At the same time, the narrative suggests that then-Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and then-Secretary of State Colin Powell were largely left out of the decision-making process.  Hypothesis: Dick Cheney was the Vice President of Bush.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states: ""A newly declassified narrative of the Bush administration's advice to the CIA on harsh interrogations shows that the small group of Justice Department lawyers who wrote memos authorizing controversial interrogation techniques were operating not on their own but with direction from top administration officials, including then-Vice President Dick Cheney and national security adviser Condoleezza Rice.""  The hypothesis states: ""Dick Cheney was the Vice President of Bush.""  The premise explicitly mentions ""then-Vice President Dick Cheney"" as one of the top administration officials who was involved in the decision-making process, which directly confirms the hypothesis. Therefore, the hypothesis follows logically from the premise."	143
1760590986	1760590987	Premise: Only a week after it had no comment on upping the storage capacity of its Hotmail e-mail service, Microsoft early Thursday announced it was boosting the allowance to 250MB to follow similar moves by rivals such as Google, Yahoo, and Lycos.  Hypothesis: Microsoft's Hotmail has raised its storage capacity to 250MB.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Microsoft announced it was boosting the storage capacity of its Hotmail e-mail service, and then specifically mentions that the new allowance is 250MB. This directly implies that the storage capacity has been increased to 250MB, which is the exact claim made in the hypothesis.  In other words, the premise provides evidence that supports the hypothesis, making it a valid conclusion.	89
1760590987	1760590989	Premise: Lina Joy, 42, was born Azlina Jailani to Malay parents, and was raised as a Muslim. Malaysia's constitution guarantees freedom of religion, but by law, all ethnic Malays are Muslim. Joy converted to Christianity at age 26, and after some bureaucratic difficulties had her named legally changed in 1999. However, on her MyKad national ID, the National Registration Department retained her stated religion as Islam. In order to have her religion changed, the National Registration Department said Joy would have to obtain a certificate of apostasy from the Muslim Sharia Court.  Hypothesis: Lina Joy's parents are from Malaysia.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis ""Lina Joy's parents are from Malaysia"" follows from the premise.  The premise states that Lina Joy was ""born Azlina Jailani to Malay parents"", which implies that her parents are from Malaysia, as Malay is a ethnic group native to Malaysia. The premise does not provide any information that would suggest her parents are from another country, so it is reasonable to conclude that they are from Malaysia."	88
1760590989	1760590991	Premise: November 9, 1989 , the day the Berlin Wall fell and the world changed forever . Not even the most astute saw it coming . As Hungary's foreign minister in the late summer of 1989 , Gyula Horn gave the order to let visiting East Germans use his country to do a 400-mile end run around the Berlin Wall , a move now seen as the beginning of the end for hard-line communism in Europe .  Hypothesis: The Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that on November 9, 1989, the Berlin Wall fell, and the world changed forever. This event is a direct consequence of the actions taken by Hungary's foreign minister, Gyula Horn, who allowed East Germans to use Hungary as a route to bypass the Berlin Wall. This move, in turn, contributed to the beginning of the end of hard-line communism in Europe.  The hypothesis, ""The Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989,"" is a direct result of the events described in the premise. The premise provides the specific date (November 9, 1989) and the circumstances that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall, making it a logical consequence of the events described. Therefore, the hypothesis follows from the premise."	166
1760590991	1760590994	"Premise: Valero Energy Corp., on Monday, said it found ""extensive"" additional damage at its 250,000-barrel-per-day Port Arthur refinery.  Hypothesis: Valero Energy Corp. produces 250,000 barrels per day.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Valero Energy Corp. found ""extensive"" additional damage at its Port Arthur refinery, which implies that the refinery exists and is owned by Valero Energy Corp. The hypothesis states that Valero Energy Corp. produces 250,000 barrels per day. This production rate is likely referring to the capacity or output of the Port Arthur refinery, which is mentioned in the premise.  The fact that the premise mentions the refinery's capacity in barrels per day (250,000) suggests that this is the relevant information being referred to in the hypothesis. Therefore, the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, as it is likely describing the production capacity of the refinery that was damaged."	150
1760590994	1760590996	Premise: Oil prices fall back as Yukos oil threat lifted  Hypothesis: Oil prices rise.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that ""Oil prices fall back as Yukos oil threat lifted"", which implies that the removal of the Yukos oil threat (whatever that means) has led to a decrease in oil prices. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that oil prices will rise.  The two statements are contradictory, as the premise suggests that oil prices will decrease, while the hypothesis suggests that they will increase. Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise."	107
1760590996	1760590999	Premise: Brian Brohm, the Louisville quarterback, threw for 368 yards and five touchdowns as the Cardinals beat visiting Oregon State 63-27.  Hypothesis: The quarterback threw for 413 yards and three touchdowns, and then ran to the end zone two more times.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Brian Brohm threw for 368 yards and five touchdowns, and the Cardinals won 63-27. This implies that the quarterback's passing performance was a significant contributor to the team's scoring, but it does not provide information about the quarterback's rushing performance.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the quarterback threw for 413 yards and three touchdowns, and then ran to the end zone two more times. This hypothesis introduces new information that is not present in the premise, specifically about the quarterback's rushing performance. It also contradicts the premise by stating that the quarterback threw for three touchdowns, whereas the premise states that he threw for five touchdowns.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow logically from the premise.	163
1760590999	1760591000	"Premise: Greg Page, a former heavyweight boxing champion who suffered a severe brain injury in a 2001 fight, has died at 50. His wife Patricia said the one-time WBA champion had died at his home in Kentucky, USA, of complications related to injuries he suffered in the fight. Page was in a coma for a week after the 9 March 2001 fight against Dale Crowe which was stopped in the 10th round. Patricia Page said he was ""in a better place now"" after announcing on Monday he had died overnight in his sleep.  Hypothesis: Greg Page was a WBA champion.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"Yes, the hypothesis ""Greg Page was a WBA champion"" follows from the premise.  The premise states: ""Greg Page, a former heavyweight boxing champion who suffered a severe brain injury in a 2001 fight, has died at 50.""  The phrase ""former heavyweight boxing champion"" implies that Greg Page was a champion at some point in his career. The fact that he was a champion is further specified as a WBA champion in the hypothesis."	94
1760591000	1760591001	"Premise: Sierra is likely to remain in jail at the Hillsborough County jail in her native Tampa until her next hearing on December 20, where she is being held without bail, which would prevent her attending the Washington event on Friday even if she still had permission to perform. Sierra has been in jail since the start of the month after an altercation with police officers outside a Tampa nightclub, which she had been ejected from. She is charged with disorderly intoxication and resisting arrest.  Hypothesis: Sierra once reached the finals of ""American Idol"".  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise only provides information about Sierra's current situation, including her arrest, charges, and upcoming hearing. It does not provide any information about her past or any previous accomplishments, such as reaching the finals of ""American Idol"". The hypothesis is making a new claim that is not supported by the given information."	74
1760591001	1760591004	Premise: Since 1987, however, Brazil has taken steps to dramatically reduce the destruction, including stepped-up enforcement and the elimination of tax incentives that led to large-scale land clearing.  Hypothesis: In the early 1990s Brazil began to take action to save the rainforest.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Brazil has taken steps to reduce the destruction of the rainforest since 1987, but it does not specify what these steps are or when they occurred. The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that Brazil began to take action to save the rainforest in the early 1990s. The premise does not provide evidence to support this specific claim.  The premise only mentions that Brazil took steps to reduce the destruction, but it does not provide enough information to pinpoint when these steps began. It is possible that the steps were taken earlier or later than the early 1990s. The premise does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis, and therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.	158
1760591004	1760591007	"Premise: FIFA has received 11 bids to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments, an international football competition contested by the men's national teams. The countries vying to host the tournament are Australia, England, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Qatar, Russia, South Korea and United States, who have individual bids and the joint bids are from Belgium-Netherlands and Spain-Portugal.  Select bids are for 2018 and 2022 tournaments and two bids are just for the 2022 tournament. Qatar and South Korea are vying just for the 2022 tournament. The two winning bids will be chosen on December 2010 by the 24-man executive committee of FIFA.  Said FIFA president Sepp Blatter: ""We are very pleased about the fantastic level of interest in our flagship competition, with all initial bidders confirming their candidature.""  Hypothesis: Sepp Blatter is the president of FIFA.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"Yes, the hypothesis ""Sepp Blatter is the president of FIFA"" follows from the premise.  The premise states: ""FIFA has received 11 bids to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments..."" and later mentions ""Said FIFA president Sepp Blatter:...""  The phrase ""Said FIFA president Sepp Blatter"" implies that Sepp Blatter is the president of FIFA, as he is the one quoted as speaking. The use of ""FIFA president"" is a direct reference to Sepp Blatter, making it clear that he is the president of the organization.  Therefore, the hypothesis that Sepp Blatter is the president of FIFA is logically deduced from the premise."	150
1760591007	1760591009	Premise: U.S. crude settled $1.32 lower at $42.83 a barrel.  Hypothesis: Crude the light American lowered to the closing 1.32 dollars, to 42.83 dollars the barrel.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that ""U.S. crude settled $1.32 lower at $42.83 a barrel."" This implies that the price of U.S. crude oil decreased by $1.32 from its previous value to settle at $42.83 per barrel.  The hypothesis states that ""Crude the light American lowered to the closing 1.32 dollars, to 42.83 dollars the barrel."" This is equivalent to saying that the price of crude oil decreased by $1.32 to settle at $42.83 per barrel, which is the same conclusion as the premise.  Therefore, the hypothesis follows logically from the premise."	142
1760591009	1760591011	Premise: WINNENDEN, Germany ―A teenage gunman killed 15 people, most of them female, on Wednesday in a rampage that began at a school near Stuttgart in southern Germany and ended in a nearby town, where he then killed himself after the police wounded him. The attack left Germany, which tightened tough gun controls after a similar attack at a school seven years ago, struggling to understand the carnage that had again befallen it, a country with relatively little violent crime. In 2002, a gunman killed 16 people before killing himself at a school in Erfurt, in eastern Germany.  Hypothesis: In 2002 near Stuttgart a boy shot 16 people.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that in 2002, a gunman killed 16 people before killing himself at a school in Erfurt, in eastern Germany. This is a specific event that occurred in a different location (Erfurt) and region (eastern Germany), whereas the hypothesis claims that the event occurred near Stuttgart, which is a different location (southern Germany).  Additionally, the premise does not mention a boy as the perpetrator, only that it was a gunman. The hypothesis makes an assumption about the age of the perpetrator, which is not supported by the premise.	125
1760591011	1760591013	Premise: Many hopes are riding on the sale of Talisman's holdings in Palm Beach and Hendry counties, which Vice President Al Gore announced with much fanfare last year at the 50th anniversary of Everglades National Park.  Hypothesis: Everglades National Park is located in Florida.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	A nice, straightforward question!  Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Vice President Al Gore announced the sale of Talisman's holdings in Palm Beach and Hendry counties, and that this was done at the 50th anniversary of Everglades National Park. The only way this makes sense is if Everglades National Park is located in Palm Beach and Hendry counties, which are both in Florida. Therefore, the hypothesis that Everglades National Park is located in Florida logically follows from the premise.	109
1760591013	1760591016	Premise: Rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy and ultimately death. Early symptoms of rabies in humans are nonspecific, consisting of fever, headache, and general malaise.  Hypothesis: Rabies is fatal in humans.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis ""Rabies is fatal in humans"" follows from the premise.  The premise states that rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy and ultimately death. This implies that the virus leads to a condition that is severe enough to cause death. The early symptoms of rabies in humans are described as nonspecific, consisting of fever, headache, and general malaise, but the premise explicitly states that the infection ultimately leads to death. Therefore, it can be inferred that the disease will not resolve on its own or be treatable, and that death is the inevitable outcome.  In other words, the premise provides a clear causal link between the infection and the outcome, which is death. The hypothesis ""Rabies is fatal in humans"" is a direct logical consequence of this causal link, and it can be deduced from the premise without any additional information."	182
1760591016	1760591019	Premise: American tobacco companies were showing a profit most quarters due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products sold including food.  Hypothesis: PM often entered markets with both cigarettes and food.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that American tobacco companies were showing a profit most quarters due to export sales of cigarettes and diversification of products sold, including food. The hypothesis specifically states that PM (a tobacco company) often entered markets with both cigarettes and food.  Since the premise mentions that the tobacco company's diversification of products included food, it is reasonable to infer that PM, as a representative of such a company, would also enter markets with both cigarettes and food. The premise provides evidence that supports the idea that PM would engage in this strategy.  The hypothesis is a specific example of a general pattern mentioned in the premise, and the premise provides the necessary information to support the hypothesis.	147
1760591019	1760591021	Premise: The development of agriculture by early humans, roughly 10,000 years ago, was also harmful to many natural ecosystems as they were systematically destroyed and replaced with artificial versions.  Hypothesis: Humans existed 10,000 years ago.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis ""Humans existed 10,000 years ago"" follows from the premise.  The premise states that ""the development of agriculture by early humans, roughly 10,000 years ago, was also harmful to many natural ecosystems as they were systematically destroyed and replaced with artificial versions."" This implies that there were early humans that developed agriculture, and that this development occurred roughly 10,000 years ago. Therefore, the existence of humans 10,000 years ago is a necessary condition for the development of agriculture to have occurred, and the premise provides evidence for this existence.  In other words, the premise is stating a specific event (the development of agriculture) and providing a timeline for it (roughly 10,000 years ago), which implies that humans must have existed at that time in order for this event to have occurred."	171
1760591021	1760591023	Premise: The two young leaders of the coup, Pibul Songgram and Pridi Phanomyang, both educated in Europe and influenced by Western ideas, came to dominate Thai politics in the ensuing years.  Hypothesis: Pibul was a young leader.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"The hypothesis ""Pibul was a young leader"" does not necessarily follow from the premise.  The premise only mentions that Pibul Songgram was one of the two young leaders of the coup, which means that he was one of the leaders who was young at the time of the coup. It does not provide information about his age at the time of the coup or at any other point in his life."	84
1760591023	1760591026	"Premise: Lin Piao, after all, was the creator of Mao's ""Little Red Book"" of quotations.  Hypothesis: Lin Piao wrote the ""Little Red Book"".  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Lin Piao was the creator of Mao's ""Little Red Book"" of quotations, which implies that Lin Piao was involved in the creation of the book, but it does not necessarily mean that he was the sole creator. The premise does not rule out the possibility that Mao or someone else also contributed to the creation of the book.  In fact, the ""Little Red Book"" is a collection of quotes and writings by Mao Zedong, and it is widely attributed to Mao's own writings and ideas. Lin Piao was a high-ranking official in the Chinese Communist Party and a close ally of Mao, but there is no credible evidence to suggest that he was the sole creator of the book.  Therefore, the hypothesis that Lin Piao wrote the ""Little Red Book"" is not supported by the premise."	181
1760591026	1760591029	Premise: When patients interrupt a course of antibiotics, the surviving bacteria return with a vengeance, often having rapidly mutated to resist the therapy.  Hypothesis: Bacteria is winning the war against antibiotics.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"The hypothesis ""Bacteria is winning the war against antibiotics"" does follow from the premise.  The premise states that when patients interrupt a course of antibiotics, the surviving bacteria return with a vengeance, often having rapidly mutated to resist the therapy. This implies that the bacteria are adapting and evolving to overcome the effects of the antibiotics, effectively rendering the treatment ineffective.  The phrase ""return with a vengeance"" also implies a sense of resurgence or retaliation, which suggests that the bacteria are gaining the upper hand. Furthermore, the fact that they ""rapidly mutate"" to resist the therapy implies a high degree of adaptability and resilience, which is consistent with the idea that the bacteria are ""winning"" the war.  Therefore, the hypothesis that ""Bacteria is winning the war against antibiotics"" is a reasonable conclusion that can be drawn from the premise."	171
1760591029	1760591031	Premise: Initially the Bundesbank opposed the introduction of the euro but was compelled to accept it in light of the political pressure of the capitalist politicians who supported its introduction.  Hypothesis: The introduction of the euro has been opposed.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that the Bundesbank initially opposed the introduction of the euro, which implies that the Bundesbank did not want the euro to be introduced. The premise also mentions that the Bundesbank was compelled to accept the euro due to political pressure from capitalist politicians who supported its introduction. This suggests that the introduction of the euro was not the preferred outcome of the Bundesbank, but was imposed upon them by external forces.  Therefore, it can be inferred that the introduction of the euro is the thing that the Bundesbank opposed, which aligns with the hypothesis. The premise provides a clear causal link between the Bundesbank's opposition and the introduction of the euro, making it reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis follows from the premise.	156
1760591031	1760591034	Premise: The Armed Forces Press Committee (COPREFA) admitted that the government troops sustained 11 casualties in these clashes, adding that they inflicted three casualties on the rebels.  Hypothesis: Three rebels were killed by government troops.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis ""Three rebels were killed by government troops"" follows from the premise.  The premise states that the government troops ""inflicted three casualties on the rebels"". This implies that the government troops caused harm or death to three individuals, which are the rebels. The phrase ""inflicted casualties"" is a euphemism for causing harm or death to others, often in a violent or military context.  The fact that the government troops sustained 11 casualties themselves (11 casualties on their own side) does not contradict the hypothesis, as it only provides information about the harm suffered by the government troops, not the rebels.  Therefore, based on the premise, it can be logically concluded that the hypothesis ""Three rebels were killed by government troops"" is supported."	155
1760591034	1760591036	Premise: One economic study will not be the basis of Canada's public policy decisions, but Easton's research does conclusively show that there are economic benefits in the legalization of marijuana.  Hypothesis: Drug legalization has benefits.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Easton's research shows that there are economic benefits in the legalization of marijuana. This implies that the research has found a positive correlation between marijuana legalization and economic benefits. The hypothesis ""Drug legalization has benefits"" is a direct conclusion that can be drawn from this premise, as it is stating the same thing as the premise.  In other words, the premise is providing evidence that supports the hypothesis, and the hypothesis is a summary or a conclusion that can be inferred from the premise."	111
1760591036	1760591039	Premise: Archaeologists have found approximately 30 beautifully preserved mummies in a 4,000 year old Egyptian necropolis which held 53 tombs. Supervisor of Antiquities for Middle Egypt Dr. Abdel-Rahman El-Ayedi's team established his archaeological site in the Faiyum Oasis near the El-Lahun Egyptian pyramid which is just south of Cairo. Besides the mummies, the team found masks, amulets, clay pots and an offering table located in a funerary chapel. The chapel dates back to about 30 BC to 337 AD.  Hypothesis: 30 beautifully preserved mummies have been located in the south of Cairo.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise. The premise states that archaeologists have found ""approximately 30 beautifully preserved mummies"" in a necropolis, which is a burial site. The hypothesis is a direct statement of this fact, simply rephrasing it in a more concise way. The premise provides all the necessary information to infer that 30 mummies were found, including the adjective ""beautifully preserved"" which is not crucial to the hypothesis.  In other words, the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the facts presented in the premise, and it does not require any additional information to be true. The premise provides the necessary information to conclude that 30 mummies were found, and the hypothesis is simply a summary of that information."	150
1760591039	1760591042	Premise: Gastrointestinal bleeding can happen as an adverse effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin or ibuprofen.  Hypothesis: Aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"The hypothesis ""Aspirin prevents gastrointestinal bleeding"" does not follow from the premise ""Gastrointestinal bleeding can happen as an adverse effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin or ibuprofen"".  The premise only states that gastrointestinal bleeding can occur as a side effect of certain drugs, including aspirin. It does not provide any information about the effectiveness of aspirin in preventing gastrointestinal bleeding. In fact, the premise does not even suggest that aspirin is effective in preventing gastrointestinal bleeding.  The premise is more like a warning or a caution, highlighting the potential risk of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with taking aspirin. It does not provide any evidence or suggestion that aspirin can prevent or mitigate this risk.  A valid hypothesis would need to be supported by evidence or logical reasoning that demonstrates a causal relationship between aspirin and the prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding. The premise does not provide such evidence, so the hypothesis does not follow from the premise."	193
1760591042	1760591044	Premise: A former employee of the company, David Vance of South Portland, said Hooper spent a lot of time on the road, often meeting with customers between Portland and Kittery.  Hypothesis: Hooper is a citizen of Portland.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that David Vance, a former employee, said Hooper spent a lot of time on the road, often meeting with customers between Portland and Kittery. This information only tells us about Hooper's work habits and travel patterns, but it does not provide any evidence about Hooper's citizenship or residency.  To determine Hooper's citizenship or residency, additional information would be needed, such as their birthplace, voting registration, or address. The premise does not provide any of this information, so we cannot conclude that Hooper is a citizen of Portland or any other location.	132
1760591044	1760591047	Premise: Cyprus, divided or not, joins the EU on the 1st of May.  Hypothesis: Cyprus was divided into two parts on May 1.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	A clever question!  The premise states that Cyprus joins the EU on May 1st, but it doesn't mention anything about the island being divided or not. The hypothesis, on the other hand, assumes that Cyprus is divided into two parts on May 1st.  Since the premise doesn't provide any information about the division of Cyprus, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis follows from the premise. In other words, the premise doesn't provide enough information to support the hypothesis.  The correct logical conclusion would be that the premise is consistent with multiple possible scenarios, including the possibility that Cyprus is not divided on May 1st, or that the division occurs at a later date, or even that the division doesn't happen at all. Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.	161
1760591047	1760591050	Premise: World leaders expressed concern on Thursday that North Korea will quit six-party nuclear disarmament talks and will  bolster its nuclear weapons arsenal.  Hypothesis: North Korea says it has a stockpile of nuclear weapons and is building more.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that world leaders are concerned that North Korea will quit the six-party nuclear disarmament talks and will bolster its nuclear weapons arsenal. This implies that North Korea has a nuclear weapons program, as the leaders would not be concerned about the country quitting talks and building up its arsenal if it didn't already have a nuclear program.  The hypothesis, ""North Korea says it has a stockpile of nuclear weapons and is building more,"" is a direct consequence of this concern. If North Korea has a nuclear weapons program and is building more, it would explain why world leaders are worried about the country quitting the talks and increasing its nuclear arsenal.  In other words, the premise provides evidence for the hypothesis by stating that world leaders are concerned about North Korea's nuclear program, which implies that North Korea has a nuclear program and is expanding it."	179
1760591050	1760591052	Premise: In addition to establishing the electoral commission, the laws also concern nationality, a contentious issue since citizenship laws were tightened to exclude one of Gbagbo's main competitors from the 2000 presidential race, former prime minister Alassane Ouattara.  Hypothesis: Gbagbo is a competitor of Ouattara.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that the laws concerning nationality were tightened to exclude one of Gbagbo's main competitors from the 2000 presidential race, former prime minister Alassane Ouattara. This implies that Gbagbo and Ouattara were both candidates in the 2000 presidential race, and Ouattara was excluded from the race due to the tightened citizenship laws. This, in turn, implies that Gbagbo and Ouattara are competitors, as they were both vying for the presidency in the same election.  Therefore, the hypothesis that Gbagbo is a competitor of Ouattara is logically deduced from the premise.	141
1760591052	1760591054	Premise: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace Prize, though he was nominated for it five times between 1937 and 1948.  Hypothesis: Mohandas received the Nobel Prize in 1989.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Gandhi was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize five times between 1937 and 1948, but did not receive it. This implies that Gandhi did not receive the prize at any point during that time period.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that Gandhi received the Nobel Prize in 1989, which is more than 40 years after the time period mentioned in the premise. Since the premise does not mention anything about Gandhi receiving the prize in 1989, the hypothesis is not supported by the premise.	122
1760591054	1760591057	Premise: The Christian Democrats (CDU) won 35.2% of the vote, or 225 seats, against 34.3% for Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats (SPD).  Hypothesis: It seems unlikely that there will be a coalition between Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats and Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that the Christian Democrats (CDU) won 35.2% of the vote, which is more than the Social Democrats (SPD) who won 34.3%. This implies that the CDU is the largest party in the election, and it is likely that they will be in a position to form a government.  The hypothesis states that it is unlikely that there will be a coalition between Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats and Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union. Given that the CDU is the largest party, it is likely that they will form a government with another party, rather than the SPD. This is because it is more common for the largest party to form a government with a smaller party, rather than with the second-largest party. Therefore, the hypothesis follows from the premise.	175
1760591057	1760591060	Premise: Edward VIII became King in January of 1936 and abdicated in December.  Hypothesis: King Edward VIII abdicated in December 1936.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"A nice simple logical question!  Yes, the hypothesis ""King Edward VIII abdicated in December 1936"" follows from the premise ""Edward VIII became King in January 1936 and abdicated in December"".  The premise provides two pieces of information:  1. Edward VIII became King in January 1936. 2. Edward VIII abdicated in December.  The hypothesis is simply the second piece of information, which is a consequence of the first piece of information. Since we know Edward VIII became King in January 1936, it is logical to conclude that he abdicated at some point later in the year, and the premise specifically states that he abdicated in December 1936.  Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise."	160
1760591060	1760591062	"Premise: Australian Guantanamo Bay detainee David Hicks has won British citizenship, opening the door for a possible bid to have him freed from the US detention facility in Cuba. Justice Lawrence Collins of the British High Court has overturned the British Government's refusal of citizenship to Hicks, whose mother was born in England. Justice Collins said the Government had ""no power to withhold or deprive citizenship"". Justice Collins said: ""In my view it would be improper to fail to give assistance which otherwise would have been given, simply because the claimant was believed to be involved in terrorism and has not had any previous connection with this country."" Hicks' lawyer, Stephen Grosz, said the decision was a breakthrough. He said there was now no reason why Hicks should not enjoy the same protection as the nine other British citizens released without charge from Guantanamo Bay on representations of the British Government.  Hypothesis: Stephen Grosz is the British lawyer of David Hicks.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states: ""David Hicks has won British citizenship... Justice Grosz, said the decision was a breakthrough."" This implies that Justice Grosz is the lawyer who is commenting on the decision. The fact that he is quoted as saying the decision is a breakthrough suggests that he is closely involved in the case and is likely the lawyer representing David Hicks. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Stephen Grosz is the British lawyer of David Hicks."	100
1760591062	1760591065	Premise: Rockweed has been harvested commercially in Nova Scotia since the late 1950's and is currently the most important commercial seaweed in Atlantic Canada.  Hypothesis: Marine vegetation is  harvested.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis ""Marine vegetation is harvested"" follows from the premise ""Rockweed has been harvested commercially in Nova Scotia since the late 1950's and is currently the most important commercial seaweed in Atlantic Canada.""  The premise provides specific information about the type of vegetation being harvested (rockweed, a type of seaweed) and the location where it is being harvested (Nova Scotia). The use of the word ""commercially"" also implies that the harvesting is being done on a large scale and for economic gain, which further supports the idea that marine vegetation is being harvested.  The phrase ""most important commercial seaweed in Atlantic Canada"" also suggests that rockweed is a significant and valuable crop, which implies that it is being harvested in large quantities and is an important part of the region's economy. Therefore, the hypothesis ""Marine vegetation is harvested"" is a logical conclusion that can be drawn from the premise."	188
1760591065	1760591066	Premise: Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has ordered security forces to take firm action against rioters following the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto. The violence has left at least 44 people dead and dozens injured. Mr. Musharraf insisted the measures were to protect people. VOA's Ayaz Gul reports from Islamabad that a bitter dispute has also erupted over how the 54-year-old politician died and who was behind her assassination.  Hypothesis: Musharraf has ordered rioters to take firm action against security forces.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that President Pervez Musharraf has ordered security forces to take firm action against rioters, implying that the action is in response to the rioters' behavior. In contrast, the hypothesis suggests that Musharraf has ordered rioters to take firm action against security forces, which is the opposite of the premise.	79
1760591066	1760591069	"Premise: A month after Gov. David A. Paterson dropped his proposal for a soda tax, New York City's health commissioner has written an article advocating ""hefty"" taxes on sodas and sports drinks containing sugar. Such a tax, the article said, could be the biggest boon to public health since tobacco taxes. The commissioner, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, and Kelly D. Brownell of Yale University, his co-author, argue in the New England Journal of Medicine that a tax of a penny per ounce could reduce consumption by more than 10 percent and raise $1.2 billion a year in New York State alone.  Hypothesis: Michael Bloomberg is the mayor of New York.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise mentions that New York City's health commissioner, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, wrote an article advocating for a tax on sodas and sports drinks containing sugar. The article was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. This suggests that the article was written in a professional capacity, likely as part of Dr. Frieden's duties as health commissioner.  As the mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg would be responsible for overseeing the city's health department, which includes the position of health commissioner. Therefore, it is likely that Dr. Frieden would report to Mayor Bloomberg.  Given this connection, it is reasonable to infer that Mayor Bloomberg would be aware of and possibly even support Dr. Frieden's proposal for a soda tax, as it is a policy initiative that falls under his purview as mayor.	177
1760591069	1760591072	Premise: Officials said the Finnish suspect was among the dead but did not provide a motive for the attack.  Hypothesis: Officials said that the suspect, a Finnish citizen, was among the dead.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states: ""Officials said the Finnish suspect was among the dead but did not provide a motive for the attack.""  The hypothesis states: ""Officials said that the suspect, a Finnish citizen, was among the dead.""  The premise provides evidence that the suspect was among the dead, which is identical to the information stated in the hypothesis. The only difference is that the premise also mentions that the motive was not provided, which is not mentioned in the hypothesis. However, this extra information is irrelevant to the statement being made about the suspect's status, which is the focus of the hypothesis.  Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise."	141
1760591072	1760591073	Premise: Britain agreed to lift by March 31 a 150-mile military protection zone enforced around the islands since Argentina invaded them in 1982.  Hypothesis: The military protection zone around Falklands was lifted.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Britain agreed to lift the 150-mile military protection zone around the Falkland Islands by March 31. This implies that the zone was previously in place, and Britain agreed to remove it. Therefore, the hypothesis ""The military protection zone around Falklands was lifted"" logically follows from the premise, as it is a direct consequence of Britain's agreement to lift the zone."	89
1760591073	1760591076	"Premise: The ferry owner PT Nur Budi's spokesman blamed Indonesian port authorities for the tragedy. ""The passenger capacity of the ferry is 205 people but the port administrator accepted more passengers as they thought it was possible,"" he said. The National Meteorological and Geophysics Agency, however, had published and raised an alert signal about high waves on Friday. It specifically stated that ""Saturday 10th and Sunday 11th, Indonesian waters would have witnessed storm force waves,"" but despite the dire warnings KM Teratai set for the seas.  Hypothesis: An Indonesian ferry with 300 passengers sank.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that the ferry's passenger capacity is 205 people, but the port administrator accepted more passengers. This implies that the ferry had more than 205 passengers on board. The hypothesis states that the ferry had 300 passengers, which is more than the capacity. Therefore, the premise provides evidence that supports the hypothesis.  Additionally, the premise mentions that the National Meteorological and Geophysics Agency had issued an alert about high waves, and despite this warning, the ferry set sail. This implies that the ferry may have been sailing in unsafe conditions, which could have contributed to its sinking. The hypothesis does not specify the exact cause of the sinking, but it is plausible that the ferry's overloaded condition and the rough seas may have contributed to the tragedy.  Overall, the premise provides sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that the Indonesian ferry with 300 passengers sank.	186
1760591076	1760591078	Premise: Tension and battles between Greek police and anarchist demonstrators took place in the centre of Athens, Greece, during the anti-war demonstration of the 4th European Social Forum which is taking place in the Greek capital, from 4 to 7 of May 2006. The march of the approximately 1,000 anarchists ended with clashes between groups of anarchists and police. Riot police used tear gas, while a branch of a Greek bank, a fast-food store and around 50 shop windows in central Athens were damaged.  Hypothesis: The riots in Greece started on December 6.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis ""The riots in Greece started on December 6"" does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the anti-war demonstration of the 4th European Social Forum took place in Athens from May 4 to 7, 2006, and that clashes between anarchists and police occurred, resulting in damage to property. There is no mention of December 6 in the premise.  The hypothesis mentions a specific date, December 6, which is not supported by the information provided in the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise."	118
1760591078	1760591081	Premise: Libya's case against Britain and the US concerns the dispute over their demand for extradition of Libyans charged with blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in 1988.  Hypothesis: One case involved the extradition of Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Libya's case against Britain and the US concerns the dispute over their demand for extradition of Libyans charged with blowing up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in 1988. This implies that the dispute is related to the extradition of Libyans who are accused of committing a crime, specifically the bombing of a Pan Am jet.  The hypothesis ""One case involved the extradition of Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie bombing"" is a specific instance of the premise, as it refers to a specific case where Libyans are accused of blowing up a Pan Am jet, which is the same event mentioned in the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise."	151
1760591081	1760591084	Premise: Argentina sought help from Britain on its privatization program and encouraged British investment.  Hypothesis: Argentina sought UK expertise on privatization and agriculture.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that Argentina sought help from Britain on its privatization program and encouraged British investment. This implies that Argentina was looking for assistance or guidance from the UK in some aspect of its privatization efforts. The hypothesis that Argentina sought UK expertise on privatization and agriculture is a plausible and logical conclusion that can be drawn from this premise.  The reason is that privatization is a complex process that requires expertise in various areas, including economic, financial, and legal aspects. Agriculture is also a significant sector in Argentina, and the country may have wanted to learn from the UK's experience in agricultural privatization. The UK has a long history of agricultural privatization, and its expertise in this area could be valuable to Argentina.  Therefore, the hypothesis is a reasonable inference that can be made from the premise, and it provides a possible explanation for why Argentina sought help from the UK.	187
1760591084	1760591085	Premise: Instead of action on crime, we got the federal long gun registry, which became a bloated bureaucratic nightmare to responsible hunters, farmers and rural Canadians. It cost taxpayers some CA$2 billion and it hasn't done a thing to reduce gun crime. said Harper. The Conservatives have provided amnesty for unregistered gun owners. At this time there is no legislation set before the House of Commons. Conservative Garry Breitkreuz from Saskatchewan tabled the bill killing the long-gun registry.  Hypothesis: Garry Breitkreuz is a member of the Conservative Party.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that ""Conservative Garry Breitkreuz from Saskatchewan tabled the bill killing the long-gun registry"". This explicitly identifies Garry Breitkreuz as a member of the Conservative Party. Therefore, the hypothesis that Garry Breitkreuz is a member of the Conservative Party is directly supported by the premise."	78
1760591085	1760591089	Premise: The researchers in the latest study fed one group of mice a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat. The diet started when the mice, all males, were 1 year old, which is middle-age in mouse longevity. As expected, the mice soon developed signs of impending diabetes, with grossly enlarged livers, and started to die much sooner than mice fed a standard diet.  Hypothesis: At the age of one year, male mice were fed with a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"The hypothesis states: ""At the age of one year, male mice were fed with a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat.""  The premise states: ""The researchers in the latest study fed one group of mice a diet in which 60 percent of calories came from fat. The diet started when the mice, all males, were 1 year old, which is middle-age in mouse longevity.""  The hypothesis is actually a restatement of the premise, which is a description of the experimental design. The premise provides the specific details of the study, including the age of the mice and the composition of their diet. The hypothesis does not make a prediction or claim about the outcome of the study, but rather simply restates the conditions under which the study was conducted.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise. A hypothesis is typically an educated guess or prediction about the outcome of an experiment, whereas the premise is a description of the experiment itself."	198
1760591089	1760591091	Premise: The soldiers, who were said to have been wearing Arab headdress, were accused of firing at Iraqi police when stopped at a road block.  Hypothesis: The soldiers were driving a civilian car and were dressed in civilian clothes when a shooting took place between them and Iraqi patrols.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis states that the soldiers were driving a civilian car and were dressed in civilian clothes when a shooting took place. The premise states that the soldiers were wearing Arab headdress and were accused of firing at Iraqi police when stopped at a road block.  The premise does not provide any information about what the soldiers were wearing when they were driving, only that they were accused of wearing Arab headdress when they fired at the Iraqi police. The premise does not rule out the possibility that the soldiers were wearing military uniforms or other attire that is not described.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise, as the premise does not provide sufficient information to conclude that the soldiers were driving a civilian car and were dressed in civilian clothes.	147
1760591091	1760591093	"Premise: The United States would like to see U.N. weapons inspectors return to Iraq providing the Iraqis take concrete, affirmative and demonstrable actions ""to show full co-operation"" Clinton said.  Hypothesis: U.N. weapons inspectors could stay in Iraq, Clinton said.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"Yes, the hypothesis ""U.N. weapons inspectors could stay in Iraq, Clinton said"" follows from the premise ""The United States would like to see U.N. weapons inspectors return to Iraq providing the Iraqis take concrete, affirmative and demonstrable actions 'to show full co-operation' Clinton said.""  The premise states that the United States wants U.N. weapons inspectors to return to Iraq, but only if the Iraqis take certain actions to demonstrate cooperation. The hypothesis is a possible consequence of this premise, as it implies that if the Iraqis do take those actions, the U.S. would be willing to allow the inspectors to stay."	130
1760591093	1760591096	Premise: On 12 August, the San Carlos Battalion came across mines placed in their path and one soldier was killed while two were seriously injured. Meanwhile on 10 August, urban commandos took a patrol car by surprise and dropped a grenade inside the car, injuring four and partially destroying the vehicle.  Hypothesis: A patrol car was attacked by the San Carlos Battalion.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise mentions that on 10 August, urban commandos took a patrol car by surprise and dropped a grenade inside the car, injuring four and partially destroying the vehicle. This suggests that the attackers were the urban commandos, not the San Carlos Battalion.  The premise also mentions that on 12 August, the San Carlos Battalion came across mines placed in their path and one soldier was killed while two were seriously injured. This incident is separate from the attack on the patrol car on 10 August and does not imply that the San Carlos Battalion was involved in the attack on the patrol car.  Therefore, the hypothesis that a patrol car was attacked by the San Carlos Battalion does not logically follow from the premise.	155
1760591096	1760591101	Premise: Bomb-sniffing dogs were brought to Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment.  Hypothesis: Bomb-sniffing dogs were estimated at Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	A nice little logic puzzle!  Let's break it down:  Premise: Bomb-sniffing dogs were brought to Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment.  This sentence implies that the bomb-sniffing dogs were physically present at Rodriguez's apartment on Mulberry St.  Hypothesis: Bomb-sniffing dogs were estimated at Rodriguez's Mulberry St. apartment.  This sentence implies that someone estimated or predicted that bomb-sniffing dogs would be present at Rodriguez's apartment on Mulberry St.  Now, let's analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis:  * The premise tells us that bomb-sniffing dogs were actually present at Rodriguez's apartment. * The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that someone thought or predicted that bomb-sniffing dogs would be present at Rodriguez's apartment.  The key difference is that the premise describes a fact (bomb-sniffing dogs were present), while the hypothesis describes a prediction or estimation (bomb-sniffing dogs were estimated to be present).  Since the premise describes a fact, it does not logically follow from the hypothesis. In other words, just because bomb-sniffing dogs were present at Rodriguez's apartment, it does not mean that someone estimated or predicted they would be present.  Therefore, I conclude that the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.	273
1760591101	1760591105	Premise: Startling new research into mobile phones claims they may reduce a man's sperm count by up to 30%.  Hypothesis: Male fertility may be affected by use of a mobile phones.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"The hypothesis ""Male fertility may be affected by use of a mobile phones"" does indeed follow from the premise ""Startling new research into mobile phones claims they may reduce a man's sperm count by up to 30%"".  The premise provides evidence that there is a correlation between the use of mobile phones and a reduction in sperm count, with the magnitude of the reduction being up to 30%. This suggests that there may be a causal relationship between mobile phone use and male fertility. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the use of mobile phones may affect male fertility.  The connection between the premise and the hypothesis is established because the premise provides a specific, measurable, and testable claim about the effect of mobile phone use on sperm count, which is a key indicator of male fertility. The hypothesis is a logical extension of this claim, suggesting that the observed effect on sperm count may have a broader impact on male fertility.  In conclusion, the hypothesis ""Male fertility may be affected by use of mobile phones"" follows logically from the premise ""Startling new research into mobile phones claims they may reduce a man's sperm count by up to 30%""."	235
1760591105	1760591107	Premise: Workers at the Lufthansa Technik Automotive plant in Co Dublin are due to vote today on changes to work practices being sought by the company's management. The aircraft engine maintenace firm has warned that rejection of the proposals would threaten a planned €17230m investment in the Rathcoole plant and put jobs at risk. LTA says it is not seeking any lay-offs or pay cuts and the planned investment would guarantee the future of the plant for the next 15 years. The work-practice changes are being sought following the collapse of Labour Relations Commission talks on the matter.  Hypothesis: Lufthansa Technik Automotive fires 30 workers.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Lufthansa Technik Automotive is seeking changes to work practices and has warned that rejection of these proposals would threaten a planned €17230m investment in the plant and put jobs at risk. However, the hypothesis states that Lufthansa Technik Automotive would fire 30 workers, which is not mentioned in the premise.  The premise only mentions the possibility of jobs being at risk if the proposals are rejected, but it does not specify that layoffs would occur. In fact, the premise states that Lufthansa Technik Automotive is not seeking any lay-offs or pay cuts. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.	147
1760591107	1760591109	Premise: It rewrites the rules of global trade, established by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, in 1947, and modified in multiple rounds of negotiations since then.  Hypothesis: GATT was formed in 1947.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"The hypothesis ""GATT was formed in 1947"" does follow from the premise.  The premise states that the rules of global trade were rewritten by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which implies that GATT already existed and was the entity that rewrote the rules. The phrase ""formed in 1947"" specifically indicates the year in which GATT was established, which is consistent with the historical fact that GATT was indeed established in 1947.  In other words, the premise provides the necessary information to infer the hypothesis, as it establishes the existence of GATT and provides a specific year for its formation."	132
1760591109	1760591111	Premise: Vice President Dick Cheney on Tuesday hurled an obscenity on the Senate floor to punctuate an angry exchange with Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy as all senators gathered for their annual photo.  Hypothesis: Cheney cursed at Sen. Patrick Leahy.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise. The premise states that Vice President Dick Cheney ""hurled an obscenity"" on the Senate floor, which implies that he used a swear word or a profanity. The hypothesis specifically states that Cheney cursed at Sen. Patrick Leahy, which is a direct consequence of the premise. The premise sets up the situation where Cheney used an obscenity, and the hypothesis draws a logical conclusion by identifying the target of his cursing as Sen. Leahy."	100
1760591111	1760591113	Premise: In the May 2005 general election Michael Howard failed to unseat the Labour Government, although the Conservatives did gain 33 seats, playing the most significant role in reducing Labour's majority from 167 to 66.  Hypothesis: In the May 2005 general election Conservatives got 33 seats.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states: ""In the May 2005 general election Michael Howard failed to unseat the Labour Government, although the Conservatives did gain 33 seats, playing the most significant role in reducing Labour's majority from 167 to 66.""  The hypothesis states: ""Conservatives got 33 seats.""  The premise explicitly mentions that the Conservatives gained 33 seats, which is the same number mentioned in the hypothesis. Therefore, the hypothesis is a direct consequence of the premise, and it logically follows from the information provided."	117
1760591113	1760591115	Premise: The Norwegian Newspaper Corpus is a large and self-expanding corpus of Norwegian newspaper texts. The collection of this dynamic and continually growing corpus began in 1998.  Hypothesis: Dagbladet is a Norwegian newspaper.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis ""Dagbladet is a Norwegian newspaper"" follows from the premise.  The premise states that the Norwegian Newspaper Corpus is a large and self-expanding corpus of Norwegian newspaper texts, and that the collection of this corpus began in 1998. The hypothesis ""Dagbladet is a Norwegian newspaper"" is a specific example of a Norwegian newspaper that is included in this corpus.  In other words, since the premise mentions that the corpus contains Norwegian newspaper texts, and Dagbladet is a Norwegian newspaper, it is reasonable to conclude that Dagbladet is included in the corpus."	127
1760591115	1760591117	Premise: The Dutch, who ruled Indonesia until 1949, called the city of Jakarta Batavia.  Hypothesis: Formerly ( until 1949 ) Batavia, Jakarta is largest city and capital of Indonesia.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that the Dutch, who ruled Indonesia until 1949, called the city of Jakarta ""Batavia"". This implies that the city was known as Batavia during the Dutch colonial era.  The hypothesis states that Jakarta is the largest city and capital of Indonesia. Since Jakarta is the city that was previously known as Batavia, it follows logically that Jakarta is the city that was referred to as Batavia during the Dutch colonial era.  Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise, as it is a direct consequence of the information provided in the premise."	125
1760591117	1760591119	"Premise: The name for the newest James Bond film has been announced today. The 22nd film, previously known only as ""Bond 22"", will be called ""Quantum of Solace"". EON Productions who are producing the film made the announcement today at Pinewood Studios, where production for the film has been under way since last year. The name of the film was inspired by a short story (of the same name) from For Your Eyes Only by Bond creator, Ian Fleming.  Hypothesis: James Bond was created by Ian Fleming.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"Yes, the hypothesis ""James Bond was created by Ian Fleming"" follows from the premise.  The premise states that Ian Fleming is the creator of Bond, and it also mentions that the name of the newest James Bond film, ""Quantum of Solace"", was inspired by a short story of the same name from For Your Eyes Only, a book written by Ian Fleming. This implies that Ian Fleming is the author of the book, and therefore, the creator of the character James Bond."	99
1760591119	1760591122	Premise: The gastric bypass operation, also known as stomach stapling, has become the most common surgical procedure for treating obesity.  Hypothesis: Obesity is medically treated.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"The hypothesis ""Obesity is medically treated"" does not necessarily follow from the premise ""The gastric bypass operation, also known as stomach stapling, has become the most common surgical procedure for treating obesity.""  The premise only states that gastric bypass operation is a common surgical procedure for treating obesity, but it does not imply that obesity is medically treated in general. There may be other medical treatments or approaches that exist for treating obesity, and the premise does not rule out the possibility of non-surgical or non-gastric bypass treatments.  For example, the premise could be true while the hypothesis is false if there are other medical treatments that are not gastric bypass operations that are used to treat obesity. Alternatively, the premise could be false while the hypothesis is true if gastric bypass operations are not a common or effective treatment for obesity.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise."	179
1760591122	1760591124	Premise: The cost of the consumer of the United States fell in June.  Hypothesis: U.S. consumer spending dived in June.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that the cost of the consumer of the United States fell in June, which implies that the prices of goods and services consumed by consumers decreased. This could potentially lead to an increase in consumer spending, as consumers may be more likely to purchase goods and services at lower prices. Therefore, the hypothesis that U.S. consumer spending ""dived"" (i.e., decreased significantly) does not logically follow from the premise.  To conclude that consumer spending decreased, you would need additional information, such as data on consumer spending patterns, income, or other economic indicators. The premise only provides information about the cost of consumption, not the actual level of consumption."	146
1760591124	1760591127	"Premise: The former leader of Iraq was rushed to hospital last Sunday after refusing to eat for sixteen days. But according to news agencies, he has ended the hunger strike by eating lunch at the court in Baghdad. ""Saddam ate beef and rice and cola with bread which he brought from hospital,"" one source told Reuters news agency. He was fasting with three co-defendants, and they were demanding more security for their defence lawyers, three of whom have been murdered.  Hypothesis: Some Australians have fasted to protest.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise is about Saddam Hussein, the former leader of Iraq, refusing to eat for 16 days and then eating lunch in a court in Baghdad. It mentions that he was fasting with three co-defendants, and they were demanding more security for their defence lawyers.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that some Australians have fasted to protest. There is no connection between the premise and the hypothesis, as the premise is about Saddam Hussein and his actions, while the hypothesis is about Australians fasting to protest. There is no mention of Australians or protests in the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.	140
1760591127	1760591129	Premise: Sonia Gandhi can be defeated in the next elections in India by BJP.  Hypothesis: Sonia Gandhi is defeated by BJP.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	A nice little logic puzzle!  The premise states that Sonia Gandhi can be defeated in the next elections in India by BJP. This implies that it is possible for her to be defeated, but it does not necessarily mean that it is certain or even probable.  The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Sonia Gandhi is defeated by BJP, which implies that she actually is defeated, not just that it is possible.  Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. The premise provides only a possibility, while the hypothesis makes a statement about actual outcome, which is not guaranteed by the premise.  In other words, the premise only sets the stage for a possibility, but does not provide enough information to conclude that the hypothesis is true.	152
1760591129	1760591133	Premise: Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has said that Mahmoud Abbas is a man that Israel can do business with.  Hypothesis: Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, may be someone Israel can talk with.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	A nice simple logic question!  The premise states that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said that Mahmoud Abbas is a man that Israel can do business with.  The hypothesis states that Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, may be someone Israel can talk with.  The two statements are related, but the hypothesis does not directly follow from the premise.  The premise only tells us what Ariel Sharon said about Mahmoud Abbas, which is a subjective opinion. It does not provide any objective evidence or logical conclusion that Abbas is someone Israel can talk with. The hypothesis is making a separate claim that requires additional evidence or reasoning to support it.  To make the hypothesis follow from the premise, we would need additional information, such as:  * Sharon's statement was based on his assessment of Abbas's willingness to engage in constructive dialogue and negotiations. * Abbas has demonstrated a commitment to peace and a willingness to make concessions in the past. * Sharon's opinion is not an isolated incident, but part of a broader pattern of Israeli leaders' views on Abbas.  Without these additional details, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.	223
1760591133	1760591135	Premise: The Tempe Hometown Premiere will have all the trappings of a mega-Hollywood  event including red carpet arrivals, klieg lights, screaming fans, paparazzi and  media coverage of the film`s stars headed by Wolverine himself, Hugh Jackman and  including Liev Schreiber, Ryan Reynolds, Taylor Kitsch, Lynn Collins, will.i.am  and director Gavin Hood.  Following a hard-fought contest stretching over thousands of cities and towns  across the United States, Tempe emerged triumphant in a far-reaching, citywide  bid to nab the gala event. Mayor Hugh Hallman himself rallied the community,  which stepped up with dozens of videos that were posted on YouTube.  Hypothesis: Hugh Jackman plays the role of Wolverine in the movie.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis ""Hugh Jackman plays the role of Wolverine in the movie"" follows from the premise.  The premise mentions that the event is a ""Hometown Premiere"" and that ""Wolverine himself, Hugh Jackman"" is one of the stars of the film. This implies that Hugh Jackman is playing the role of Wolverine in the movie, as Wolverine is a fictional character from the X-Men franchise, and Hugh Jackman is the actor who has played the character in several films. The use of ""Wolverine himself"" also suggests that Hugh Jackman is the one playing the character, rather than just being a guest at the premiere."	134
1760591135	1760591137	Premise: In October, however, amid rising tensions between the government and opposition groups, a car bomb seriously injured an opposition politician and killed his driver, in Beirut.  Hypothesis: A member of the opposition was injured in a car bomb attack in Beirut.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that ""a car bomb seriously injured an opposition politician and killed his driver, in Beirut."" The hypothesis states that ""a member of the opposition was injured in a car bomb attack in Beirut.""  The premise specifically identifies the injured party as an ""opposition politician"", which is a member of the opposition. Additionally, the premise describes the event as a car bomb attack, which matches the description in the hypothesis. Therefore, the hypothesis is logically deducible from the premise."	109
1760591137	1760591140	Premise: Weinstock painstakingly reviewed dozens of studies for evidence of any link between sunscreen use and either an increase or decrease in melanoma.  Hypothesis: skin cancer numbers increase.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	The hypothesis is that skin cancer numbers increase, but the premise states that Weinstock reviewed studies for evidence of any link between sunscreen use and either an increase or decrease in melanoma. The premise does not provide any information that suggests a direct link between sunscreen use and an increase in melanoma, which is the hypothesis being tested.  In fact, the premise is neutral, as it only states that Weinstock reviewed studies for evidence of any link between sunscreen use and melanoma, without making any claims about the direction of the relationship. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.  To test the hypothesis, Weinstock would need to have found evidence in the studies reviewed that sunscreen use is associated with an increase in melanoma, which is not necessarily implied by the premise.	161
1760591140	1760591144	Premise: Most people are familiar with the idea of St. Bernards or other dogs taking part in rescue and recovery efforts. Robots might also take part in search and rescue missions.  Hypothesis: Robots are used to find missing victims.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis ""Robots are used to find missing victims"" follows from the premise ""Most people are familiar with the idea of St. Bernards or other dogs taking part in rescue and recovery efforts"".  The premise establishes that animals, specifically dogs, are used in rescue and recovery efforts. The hypothesis then extrapolates that, if animals are used for this purpose, it's possible to imagine a scenario where robots, which are also artificial agents, could be used for the same purpose. The idea is not that dogs are the only ones that can be used, but rather that if animals are capable of being used for rescue and recovery, it's logical to consider the possibility that robots, which possess similar capabilities (such as navigation, sensing, and mobility), could also be used for the same purpose.  In other words, the premise provides a precedent for using artificial agents (animals) in rescue and recovery efforts, which leads to the logical conclusion that robots, another type of artificial agent, could also be used for the same purpose."	210
1760591144	1760591146	Premise: Illinois born Charlton Heston was a 27-year-old actor from Broadway and television when he arrived in Hollywood for a five-picture contract with Hal Wallis.  Hypothesis: Charlton Heston was born in Illinois.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that ""Charlton Heston was a 27-year-old actor from Broadway and television when he arrived in Hollywood for a five-picture contract with Hal Wallis."" The phrase ""from Broadway and television"" is not providing additional information about Heston's birthplace. It is describing his background and experience in the entertainment industry, but it does not contradict the statement that he was born in Illinois.  The premise does not provide any information that would suggest Heston was born anywhere other than Illinois, so it is reasonable to infer that he was born in Illinois based on the information provided."	134
1760591146	1760591148	Premise: Ruth's 1927 single season record of 60 home runs stood unsurpassed until Roger Maris hit 61 in 1961.  Hypothesis: Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs in his lifetime.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	No, the hypothesis does not follow from the premise.  The premise states that Ruth's 1927 single season record of 60 home runs stood unsurpassed until Roger Maris hit 61 in 1961. This implies that Ruth's 60 home runs in 1927 was a single-season record, but it does not imply that he only hit 60 home runs in his lifetime.  In fact, it is well-known that Babe Ruth hit 714 home runs in his lifetime, not just 60. The premise is only talking about his single-season record, not his overall career total. Therefore, the hypothesis that Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs in his lifetime is false.	141
1760591148	1760591151	Premise: The German technology was employed to build Shanghai's existing maglev line, the first in the world to be used commercially.  Hypothesis: Maglev is commercially used.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis ""Maglev is commercially used"" follows from the premise ""The German technology was employed to build Shanghai's existing maglev line, the first in the world to be used commercially.""  The premise states that German technology was used to build the Shanghai maglev line, which is the first in the world to be used commercially. This implies that the maglev line is indeed being used commercially. The use of the word ""first"" also implies that it is the first instance of its kind, which further supports the idea that maglev is being used commercially.  The connection between the German technology and commercial use is made by the phrase ""the first in the world to be used commercially"", which indicates that the maglev line is being used for commercial purposes. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that maglev is commercially used based on the premise."	174
1760591151	1760591154	"Premise: SEATTLE — United Nations gang leader Clay Roueche should spend at least 30 years behind bars after his surprise guilty plea here Tuesday for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine, marijuana and illicit drug profits, U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Sullivan said. Sullivan said outside court that Roueche's leadership of the violent UN gang and the sophistication of the international drug conspiracy will all be factors used to argue for a longer sentence — up to life — for the 33-year-old Canadian. And he stressed that the plea agreement reached with Roueche did not include ""any kind of break with respect to sentencing."".  Hypothesis: Clay Roueche is 33 years old.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"Yes, the hypothesis ""Clay Roueche is 33 years old"" follows from the premise.  The premise states: ""United Nations gang leader Clay Roueche should spend at least 30 years behind bars after his surprise guilty plea here Tuesday for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine, marijuana and illicit drug profits, U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Sullivan said. Sullivan said outside court that Roueche's leadership of the violent UN gang and the sophistication of the international drug conspiracy will all be factors used to argue for a longer sentence — up to life — for the 33-year-old Canadian.""  The crucial sentence is: ""for the 33-year-old Canadian."" This sentence explicitly states that Clay Roueche is 33 years old, which is the same age mentioned in the hypothesis. Therefore, the hypothesis follows logically from the premise."	170
1760591154	1760591157	"Premise: Baker's voice will replace the earlier computer-synthesized voice that was previously used. BT said that his voice was chosen as it was instantly recognisable. It took him 11 days to record 11,593 phrases and sounds which could then be broken down and reassembled by a computer to make new words. It then took five months to process these recordings to make a workable service. BT have said that there will be no barriers as to what Tom Baker's voice can 'say', including rude words. ""What appeals to me most is the thought that I will be bringing good news to people whether it is a cheeky message, a birthday greeting, or just a quick hello,"" said Baker.  Hypothesis: Tom Baker works for BT.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice."	"Yes, the hypothesis ""Tom Baker works for BT"" follows from the premise.  The premise states that ""Baker's voice will replace the earlier computer-synthesized voice that was previously used"" and that ""BT said that his voice was chosen as it was instantly recognisable"". This implies that Tom Baker has been hired by BT to provide his voice for their new voice service.  Additionally, the premise mentions that it took five months to process the recordings to make a workable service, which suggests that Baker was involved in the production of the service. The fact that BT has no barriers as to what Tom Baker's voice can ""say"" also implies that he is an employee or contractor of BT, rather than just a celebrity lending his voice for a one-off project.  Therefore, based on the information provided, it is reasonable to conclude that Tom Baker works for BT."	178
1760591157	1760591159	Premise: The Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for the selection of the candidates and the choice of Prize Winners for the Peace Prize. The Committee is composed of five members appointed by the Storting (Norwegian parliament). The Peace Prize is awarded in Oslo, Norway and not in Stockholm, Sweden like the other Nobel Prizes.  Hypothesis: Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that the Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for selecting the candidates and choosing the Prize Winners for the Peace Prize. This implies that the Committee has a role in choosing the winners, which means that the hypothesis ""Nobel Peace Prize candidates have been chosen"" is a direct consequence of the Committee's actions.  The premise does not provide any information that would contradict or undermine the hypothesis. In fact, the premise explicitly states that the Committee is responsible for selecting candidates, which suggests that they have indeed chosen candidates for the Prize. Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise."	127
1760591159	1760591162	Premise: More than 150 dolphins, marine turtles and beaked whales have been washed up dead on beaches in Africa.  Hypothesis: Dead dolphins, turtles and whales have been found on African beaches.  Does the hypothesis follow from the premise? Explain your choice.	"Yes, the hypothesis follows from the premise.  The premise states that ""More than 150 dolphins, marine turtles and beaked whales have been washed up dead on beaches in Africa."" This sentence explicitly states that dead dolphins, turtles, and whales have been found on beaches in Africa.  The hypothesis ""Dead dolphins, turtles and whales have been found on African beaches"" is a direct summary or restatement of the information provided in the premise. It is a concise and accurate summary of the situation described in the premise.  Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise, as it is a straightforward and unambiguous conclusion that can be drawn from the information provided."	134
